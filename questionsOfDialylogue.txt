The kitchen stinks . 

So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? 
 Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . 
 Not for me , Dick . 
 Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . 
 You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . 
 Well , how long will it be ? 
 OK . We'll wait . 
 Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for . 

Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! 
 Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . 
 Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? 
 Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 
 Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak . Could she have something else instead ? 
 Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that . 
 Why not ? See . 
 Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . 
 According to some studies it may cause cancer . 
 I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . 

I'm exhausted . 

Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? 
 How many of you , please ? 
 I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . 
 I like Chinese food . 
 We have a lot of Chinese restaurants in America . 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 A glass of Qingdao beer . 
 Will you make some recommendation ? 
 I need a packet of cigarettes please . 
 Thanks . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ? 
 I'll just go and check it for you , sir . 
 By all means . 
 No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . 
 So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . 
 No , thank you . 
 You are in luck . We just receive a shipment of several different styles of white purses . 
 Yes , I believe they are . Here are something that might interest you . 
 Sure . Let me ring this up for you at the register . If you would like , this can be gift-wrapped for free . Just take it to the customer service department . 
 Where is your store located ? 
 Right , I'll be right over . 
 Can you please tell me where you are located ? 
 Thank you , I know where that is . 
 I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too . 
 I think so . Aren't the four Cs , cut , clarity , carat and color . 
 Well , my price range is a 5,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars , I'm looking for a marquise cut on the wide band . 

Would you like a lift home ? 

Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ? 
 Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum . 

I think I going to need some iced water too . Is there an extra charge for that ? 
 That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ? 
 Yes , I would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper . 
 Do I owe you anything for the sauce , pepper and napkins ? 

I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose ? 
 Great , I'll take one . 
 Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ? 
 Oh , I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1.7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne ? 

Golden Taxi cabs , how may I help you ? 
 Sure , where are you ? 

OK , I'm sorry it took so long . 
 The phone has been ringing off the hook today . 

Hello , I need to get a cab . 
 That's fine . 

Is Tom available please ? 
 Sure . 

Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane . 
 Sure . 

Is Tom here ? 

Looks like dinner's ready . 

May I try on this dress ? 

I made my little brother cry . 

Can I have the check please ? 
 Is this amount correct ? 
 Thank you , the service was good 

Are you through with your meal ? 
 Here you go . I can take care of it here when you are already . 
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . 
 Thank you , I'll be right back . Do you need any to go boxes ? I'd be glad to bring you some when I come back . 

I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ? 
 Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best . 
 Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ? 
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for a black pair . 

Are you OK ? 
 So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ? 
 What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep . 
 I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive . 
 Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one . 
 Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice . 
 Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show . 
 No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' . 

Did anyone call ? 
 What did he want ? 

Could I have the check , please ? 

Any phone calls for me while I was out ? 
 Thank you . 

Hello , may I help you ? 
 Yes , everything is 25 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and slacks that will go well with the sweater . I especially like this flowery skirt . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to your right . 

May I help you ? 
 You will need to wait a few minutes for fries . They're still in the fryer . 
 Your total comes to 7 dollars . 
 Thank you . Your cash back is 13 dollars . Pull into a parking states , and we'll bring you your fries in two minutes . 

I'm sorry . Is that bicycle yours ? 
 I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot . 
 I'm really sorry . I'll face the music . 
 Right here . See the scratch ? 

How are we going to get there ? 

Hi , sorry to have kept you waiting . 
 How are you ? 

Andrew's Hair Salon , this is Andrew . 
 Hi Linda , what can I do for you ? 
 For what day ? 

I'm getting a tattoo tomorrow . 

My mother bought me a new video game . 
 Well , the hero is a Super Warrior . He has to fight the bad guys to find the treasure . 
 There are a lot ! Two really bad ones are Giant Monster and Human Spider . 
 It's in a dungeon , under a castle . 
 It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . 

I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday . 
 It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! 
 I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ? 

Mrs . Sue ? 
 Mr . Brown will have to call you back in a little while . 

I lost my wallet . 

Mr . Zhang , are you still there ? 
 Can she call you back ? She is about to start a meeting . 

I'm going to the pub tonight . 

I'm sorry I'm late . 

Hi ! This is John Li , is my car fixed yet ? 

Hi ! This is Tome Smith . 
 Is my VCR ready ? 

This skirt is too tight . I would like to return it please . Do I need to go to the customer's service desk ? 
 No , I receive this as a birthday present , but the price tag is still on the skirt though . Will that be OK ? 
 Do you have any more skirts in this style ? I would like to find a size larger . 
 No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else . 

Nani Book Store . How can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have one copy left . 

Would you ring these up for me here ? 
 Yes , I did , thanks . 
 No , I'll pay for it in cash . 
 Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries . 
 Is there a discount for buying in large quantity ? 
 Yeah , of course . You can take a taxi . 
 It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable . 
 Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem . 
 For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . 
 It's two blocks down the road . 
 Is Diana in ? 
 Yes , please ask her to call John Smith . 

What's for lunch ? 

Could you have a taxi pick me up and take me to the airport before 1 p . m . ? 
 I live at 323 Park Street . 
 What are your rates ? 
 I have four very large suitcases . Will those fit in the taxi ? 

Do you think you can fix my computer ? 

Ah , Oh ! Are you hurt ? 
 Maybe I'd better call an ambulance . 
 Are you sure ? 

Taxi ! 
 Please rush me to the railway station 
 Can you speed up a bit ? 
 But I have no time to lose . 
 Can you drop me off here ? 

Hello , is Sue there ? 
 Sue John . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 Well done ! 
 There is no one here by that name . 
 No , this is 2517759 . 
 That's all right . 
 Wrong number . 
 No , it is not . 

Let's eat out . 

May we see the wine list please ? 
 That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ? 
 I'd like a bottle please . 
 Here you go . 

Help ! Help ! 

Hello , is John in ? 
 No , I'll call back later . 

That's two for me and one for you . 

May I please speak to Tom ? 
 I'll just try him again . 
 No , but what time do you expect him back ? 

Hello , is John in ? 
 Yes , would you leave him a message to call me ? 

I can't finish this steak . 

Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? 
 Does this bus go there ? 
 Let's step in , Dad . 
 Dad . Here comes another bus . 
 Why ? Dad ? 

I'm trying to reach Robert please . 
 What time should I call back ? 

I can't find my keys . 

Can you connect me to Mary . Smith Hotel room ? 
 Can you leave a message for her to call her office ? 

May I please speak to Tom ? 

What's the best way downtown ? 
 Depends ? Depends on what ? 
 Is that expensive ? 
 I am in no particular hurry . 
 That's not so bad . 
 I see . 
 I'm sorry Marry is out right now . 
 Why don't you call back later this afternoon ? 
 Where to ? 
 He stepped out of the office for a little while . 
 In about twenty minutes . 
 Sorry . I didn't mean to . 
 I've got it . 
 No , he is at work now . 
 Sure . It's 289,1234 . 
 Go right ahead . 
 To the office . I'll be right back . 
 Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week ! 
 You don ’ t have to explain . Suit yourself . 
 We ’ ll see . 

I hate doing the damn laundry . 

Sam , you ’ Ve got to forgive me . 
 I used your computer . And I ’ m afraid I ’ Ve erased your personal files accidentally . 
 I ’ m afraid not . I apologize . 
 I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? 

It looks to be a nice day today . 
 Okay , I'll get the car out of the garage . 

Jim , could you do me a favor ? 
 My car has a problem starting . Could you please take a look at it for me ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Thanks for helping me out . I really appreciate it . 

Could you baby-sit for me tonight ? 

How did you get the piano here ? 
 You never did it on your own . 

It sounds like Bob's getting out of bed . 
 It was after 2 am . 

Are you ready to leave ? 

Don't do that . You are asking for trouble . 

Shall we buy ? 
 But if you were me ? 

It's time to go to bed . 
 I don't care , it's school in the morning . 

What are you eating ? 
 Why ? 

It's your turn to go first . 
 No , Mary went first last time . 

Shall we go out tonight ? 
 We'd better ask dad first . 

I'll cook dinner for you . 

Have you got any better ? 
 Okay , I'll take one . 

Let me help you with that . 
 You really shouldn't be lifting this by yourself . 

Let's eat out . 

Why aren't you going out ? 

What are you doing tomorrow ? 
 What time will you be home ? 

What did you do today ? 
 Did you win ? 

Hang out the clothes . 

Do you play mahjong ? 

You stink ! 

I cooked , so ... 

Hello , Mr . Brown . 
 Yes , I'm here to fix your pipes . 

Here comes the bus . 

Can I have this shoe in the black please ? 
 Okay . 

Get up , you lazybones ! 

Shall we start decorating the bedroom ? 
 When ? 

How much is this ? 
 The large one . 
 Is this the only kind you have ? 
 Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide . 

Why did you stay home today ? 

My battery's flat in my mobile . 
 And I couldn't find another phone . 

Is there a doctor here ? 
 Can you call an Ambulance ? 

I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ? 
 Is there a bathroom ? 
 It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ? 
 See you later ! 
 Welcome ! Come in , please ! 
 This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is . 
 Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside . 
 Anytime you like . 

I wonder if you could help me ? 
 Could you take a picture of me to my friend ? 

You just ran a red light . 

First you add the washing powder then you add the clothes . 
 Yes , for the last 20 years . 

Good afternoon , sir . Would you like a tea ? 
 Of course sir , would you like milk and sugar with that ? 

He's going too slow . 

I stayed at Bob's last night . 
 I guess I should have told you . 

Are you going to come home late tonight ? 

Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see . 
 You gotta help me out this time , buddy . 

Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ? 
 Why ? What's the problem ? 

Anna , Would you like to dance ? 
 Don ’ t worry about it . I ’ ll show you how . It ’ s a piece of cake . 

Jodi , I must get a hold of Jim today , but I forgot his address and phone number . 
 Really ? You ’ Ve helped me a lot . Thank you . 

How's the chicken ? 

Would you pour me some of that tea , please ? 

Would you care for a drink ? 

Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ? 
 When do you expect him back ? 
 Well , may I leave a message ? 
 Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? 
 I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . 

Welcome back . 

How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 

I come home for lunch . 
 Only 1 hour . 

May I speak to Marry ? 
 Will it be too late if I call around ten this evening ? 

Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 

We're broke . 

Where do you want to go ? 
 Get in . I'll take you . 
 It will cost you $ 10 . 
 You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know . 
 Certainly . 
 She's going to kill you . 
 It wasn't me . 
 Yeah , that was close . 
 There's a bookstore just across the street . 
 It's not my fault . 
 Don't be silly . Let's go Dutch . 
 I have no idea . 
 You do ? OK , fine with me . 
 But I also want ya to do me a favor . 
 You gotta have some better deodorant . 

Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? 
 Oh you ’ re so kind ! 

That'll be eight dollars , please . 

These are new arrivals . 
 Try them if you like . 
 What about that one over there ? 

Thank you for calling the Twin Theatre . 
 The next show is at two o'clock . 

Do you have wool socks ? 
 Can you guarantee the quality ? 
 Where are the panty-hose ? 

Do you have any fresh baked donuts for sale yet ? 
 Yes , I'd like five croissants , too . 

Taxi ! 
 Wangfujing , please ! 
 Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice . 
 I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too . 
 That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us . 
 It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes . 
 The radio has brought us lots of convenience . 
 With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere . 

Do you have these shoes in a size 7 ? 

What a mess ! 

I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . 
 I want to know what's on that channel . 
 There is a football match . 
 OK . Could you turn it down ? 
 I'm going to listen to the radio . 

Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? 
 Can you also show me this one ? 
 I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . 
 Will the luster fade out after some time ? 
 Ok . Can I try it on ? 

Mommy , can I stay up until eleven o'clock ? 

May I speak to Peter ? 

It's so boring . 
 I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? 
 Do you mind if we switch over ? 
 What's the movie ? 
 It must be interesting . 

Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? 
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 
 Is there anything interesting ? 
 I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? 
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 
 I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? 
 It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . 
 It can also entertain your passengers like me . 

Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . 
 That is your excuse . 
 Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! 
 Can't I play more ? 
 Mom , I'll be finished soon . 

Hi , who has the remote control ? 
 Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . 
 Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? 
 Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . 
 A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . 
 It might begin now . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . 
 What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? 
 Really ? Who will play ? 
 That's cool . I'll watch it . 
 There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . 

May I have a cookie ? 

By the way , where's Jim ? 

Watch out ! 

Eat some more . 

Hurry up , will you ? 

Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . 
 Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Er ... How about this one ? 
 Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part . 

Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . 
 I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . 
 Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . 
 Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . 
 You are welcome . 
 What for ? 
 Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? 
 Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . 
 For here or to go ? 
 Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . 
 Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? 

Open the book and turn to page 10 . 
 No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . 
 No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . 
 Mom , can I have some ice cream ? 
 Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? 

Dad , can you help me ? 
 I don't know how to do it . 
 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? 
 You got it . Good job . 
 It was bad . 
 But I already tried my best . 

Is Bob home ? 

Dad , how do you say this word ? 
 What does this word mean ? 
 Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . 

Jenny , what's your favorite color ? 
 Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? 
 Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . 
 What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ? 
 Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? 

Something's wrong with my air conditioning . 

Mom , I don't feel well . 
 I feel dizzy . 
 Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . 

What do you want to be ? 
 Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? 
 Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . 
 The movies . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 No , mom . Piano is for girls . 
 No way , mom . I don't like piano . 
 All right , all right . I understand . 
 Mom , what should I do ? 
 OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . 

Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? 
 That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . 
 Mom , the water is boiling ! 

Can you make out what he's saying ? 

It's your turn now , Helen . 
 This is your song . I picked it for you . 
 Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . 
 I think it's a piece of cake for you . 
 Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . 
 I hope so . Thank you for saying so . 
 Coming ! 
 Sure . What's up ? 
 It's Peter's turn . 
 OK . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ! 
 He has a really good voice ! 

Can you pass me the lighter ? 

Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? 
 Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . 
 How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? 
 I wouldn't do that . 

What kind of music do you like ? 
 Me too . 
 Qi In is . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 No problem . 
 It's for you . 
 Sixty dollars . 
 Go ahead . 
 Over there . 
 I'm fine , dad . 
 No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? 

Do you shop online often ? 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket . 
 What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ? 

Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up ! 
 Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . 
 Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! 
 I'm afraid so . 
 Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . 
 Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine . 
 I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed . 

Honey , I need to have a talk with you . 
 No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ? 
 Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why . 

Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? 
 Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . 
 More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . 
 Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? 
 I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . 
 I can't help it . 
 Of course . 
 I'll be with you in a minute . 
 Why ? 
 OK . You can change it . 
 No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? 
 Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? 
 I'm sure you will like it . 
 No more today , honey . 
 Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now . 
 Just go to read . I will find it , honey . 
 I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night . 
 I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
 Of course . 
 No , mom . I haven't seen it . 
 Mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ? 

Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? 
 When is he coming back ? 
 I'll call again in thirty minutes . 
 What did she say ? 
 What's your plan ? 
 Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her . 

These vegetables taste very sweet . 
 Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ? 
 Dad , come on ! Just tell me . 

Do you know anything about health food ? 
 Can you give me some examples ? 
 Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? 
 Anything else ? 

Our dinner is ready . 
 Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber . 
 It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit . 
 I didn't buy any of it at all . Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good . 
 I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you . 

How much was your watch ? 

Mom , did you see Andy's dog ? 
 Mom , please . Can I have a pet dog like Andy's ? 
 Mom , we can keep it on the balcony , right ? 

Jenny , what are you going to do tomorrow morning ? 
 I'm thinking of taking you and Peter swimming . What do you think ? 
 But swimming in the winter is good for your body . Believe me . 
 Well , what game do you want to play ? 
 Do you know how to play it ? 
 OK . Teach me how to play the game . 
 Do you have any special brand in your mind ? 
 I see . Have a look at this one . It ’ s very cheap because it ’ s not very durable . 
 Ok , the mirror is over there . 
 No . Um , do you carry any padded coat ? 
 Small size . 
 Whatever . You know , I ’ m thinking of a gift for my mother . It ’ s her 60 birthday next Friday . Could you give me some advice ? You are the expert . 
 Looks nice . How much do you charge ? 
 That ’ s sheer robbery . I ’ m sure you can do better than that . 
 $ 80 . 
 No problem . 
 Good . Anything else ? The tie pins ? The cuff links ? 
 Ok . We have several kinds of scarves here . Let me get them for you . Just wait a minute . 

Did your eye doctor prescribe you contact lenses ? 
 Oh , I see . We have both hard and soft contact lenses . They are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses . 
 We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ? 
 What about this pair ? They are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . Try them on . 
 Please go to receive optometry first over there . 
 Yes . I ’ m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ? 
 These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ? 
 I ’ ll take them . 
 Yes we do . Check the meat department . There is a fish counter there too . 
 Let me show you . 
 See , it's right over there . 
 That's all right . 
 What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes . 
 At your service . Will this suit you ? 
 This is Chinese made . 
 Yes , it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price . 
 Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more . 
 It's just around the corner 
 No problem . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Can you help me move this table ? 
 It depends . 
 Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ? 
 Yes , but the offer only lasts this week . 
 I'm not sure , what about you ? 
 Sure sounds good to me . 
 Are you sure there is enough paint for the house ? 
 No problems . What color ? 
 It's my favorite . 
 I like Indian food as well . 
 How did you do on your driving test ? 
 That's great and it was your first try . 
 Nothing special . 
 It was washed by washing machine . 
 I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money . 
 It's very nice of you . I'll try my best to do my job well . 
 How do you want your egg cooked ? 
 Okay , it'll be ready in two minutes . 
 Thanks . 
 Good morning . Could you tell me where I can find the Clothing Department ? 
 I ’ d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa . 
 Thank you very much . 

Hi , sir . Come and have a look here . We have all kinds of sweaters . 
 How do you like this grey one ? It ’ s pure wool , one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool . 
 Yes , we do . What size do you want ? 
 Well , you can always bring it back to us for a full refund . 
 Yes , just a moment , please . 
 No , I don't . 
 Because I think it's boring 
 Learn a lot ? Really ? 
 Do you have magazines now ? 
 Can you lend me one ? 

Is that the latest issue of Reader you're reading ? 
 I know . I have been a subscriber for the past two years . 
 I'm not exactly sure , but it's not that expensive at all . 
 Why did you do that ? 
 It's the same in my family . The coffee table in my living room is covered with copies of Fashion . 
 You are late . The last piece has sold out . 
 There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories . 
 There are various magazines in the rack . 
 That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars . 
 Have a nice trip . 
 Yes , I do . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 You're right . 
 Which one ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 Can you repair my shoes ? 
 Really ? Look at the toe of this shoe . It is worn out . 
 Can you do it ? 

Hi . I need to have my shoes repaired . 
 Look at the heels . They are slanting . 
 How much does it cost ? 
 I think it ’ s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ’ ll go to another B . 
 How long will it take ? Could you repair them while I wait ? 
 Great ! I ’ ll just sit here and wait . 
 There is one just around the corner . 
 The price is moderate , but their work is sometimes not satisfactory . 
 No , there is not , as far as I know . 
 I came here to ask for some information . 
 I bought a pair of trousers last year , which I like the best . But this year they don ’ t fit me very well . They ’ re tight in the waist , baggy at the knees . Can you make some alterations ? 
 It seems I find the right place . 
 When can I have my trousers if I bring it to you tomorrow ? 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) 
 A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan . 
 If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years . 

Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service . 
 Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . 
 Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . 
 Oh , it's a reserved opera named ' The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven ' . 
 It surely is . And the cast is really the best . 
 The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . Which kind would you like ? 
 Yes , we have subtitles both in Chinese and English on the big-screen just beside the stage . 
 Sure . And our theater is located on Liberty Avenue , just opposite the biggest guitar store . Can I have your name ? 
 Got it . Thanks for calling . Bye . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) 
 A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan . 
 If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years . 

Could you please pass me the salt ? 

Can I also take the MET to get there ? 
 No , can I trouble you to lend me a hand ? 
 You have to buy a ticket first . You want to go to Shi Da , right ? 
 Ok , then you need to go to Tai Power Building Station . 
 Look at the map to see where you are . Then look at where you want to go . The number is how much money you have to pay . 
 Then , when you have your ticket , you go wait on the platform . 
 Just remember to hold on to your ticket . You need it to get out of the station when you get there . 
 Let me see . 
 Let's see . From here , you have to take the 278 bus . 
 You should get off at the first Shi Da stop . 
 You're new at this , huh ? 
 No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off . 
 Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus . 
 Don't mention it . 
 I would like to have a roll developed . 
 How about tomorrow morning ? 
 The 4 x6 will be OK . Thanks . 
 I prefer glossy . How much ? 
 Thanks ! 
 Yes , we shall . What size do you like ? 
 Which do you prefer , color or black and white ? 
 OK . 
 They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ? 
 No problem . Do you need another film ? 
 It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films . 
 Yes , where's the meat counter ? 
 I need to buy some pork for the party . Give me about one kilogram . 
 I wonder if the chops are fresh . 
 One kilogram , too . 
 No , thanks . 
 I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ? 
 My son . He is two years old . 
 Is it ? 
 May I have a look at the introduction ? 

Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed . 
 Yes , or you'll be late . 
 It went off 30 minutes ago . 
 Rise and shine . 

Ouch ! I just bit my tongue . 
 I think it's bleeding . 
 I am , as a matter of fact . Do you have any special requests ? 
 Wait . This is sounding like a major list . Why don't you just come with me ? 
 I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . 
 What do you have in mind ? 
 I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ? 
 Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . 
 Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . 
 His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . 
 No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . 
 Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . 
 Do you need money or what ? 
 Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ? 
 I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned . 
 Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? 
 I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . 
 The movie company has to pay them ? 
 Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! 
 Yes , I have many things to buy . I would like to choose the cleaning milk first . 
 Dry . That's my problem . 
 Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf . 
 Is it a newcomer ? 
 I do not care the brand as long as it works well . 
 I want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of Jiajieshi . 

Welcome . May I help you ? 
 We have different colours of eye-shadow . May I know what colour you usually wear ? 
 Yes , I see . How do you like this one ? 
 Certainly . 
 Not from this brand , I'm afraid . 
 How about this one ? 

Hey , Mom , look what I found ! 

Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ? 
 Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . 
 Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years . 
 It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course . 
 Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner . 
 Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print . 
 Thanks , Jane . 

I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ? 
 It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . 
 The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . 
 It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . 

Hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast . 
 You won't make it through the day without breakfast . 
 Breakfast is brain food . Maybe that's why your grades are Suffering . 
 Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast . 

What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? 
 But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 
 So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? 
 How about drinking soda ? 
 And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 
 How do you know so much about food and dieting ? 

Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . 
 Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . 
 Gee ! You are really strong-willed . 
 Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . 
 Sure . What's it , Yvonne ? 
 Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . 
 Almost . Let me get my bag . 
 What are you doing ? 
 It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? 
 Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! 
 That will be my pleasure . 
 You don't know what you are asking ! 
 Remember what happened last time ? 
 Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . 
 Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ? 
 Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . 
 I don't need the full service . 
 No , thanks . All I need is painting and polishing . 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . 
 Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . 

Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? 
 I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? 
 A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . 
 Oooo . This sounds serious . 

Are you ready to order yet , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . 

Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ? 
 Moooooommmmm ! You're so in ! Anything else you've been keeping from me ? 
 Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! 
 Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! 

Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . 
 Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive . 
 Really ? 

I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . 
 It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls . 
 Do you have any product that controls frizz ? 
 Thank you ! 

What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . 
 If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . 
 It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . 

Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ? 
 Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ? 
 But the price is too high . 
 What about 15 yuan ? 
 All right , I'll take it . 
 Thank you . 
 Good morning . I'm interested in antiques . Do you have any ? 
 What do you have ? 
 I'd like porcelain . 
 Oh , it looks well . I like it very much . 
 How much is it ? 
 It's not expensive . I'll take it . 
 Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? 
 Would you show me some ? 
 They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? 
 I'll take two small ones and a big one . 
 I'm afraid not . 

I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives . 
 Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful . 
 How much is it ? 
 Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful ! 
 This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room . 
 I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase . 
 All right . I will take one . 
 Yes , several times . 
 Not bad . 
 Then , why didn't you do that ? 
 Some of them , I think , are not good . 
 No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . 
 I judge by appearances . 
 It certainly is . 
 Don't try everything at one time , please . 

It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . 
 Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . 
 Sounds good . May I have a look ? 
 They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . 
 Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? 
 Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Certainly . Here you are . 
 Four hundred yuan . 
 I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this . 
 Well , I'll have it wrapped for you . 
 Thank you . Please come again . 
 There's some leftover pizza from last night . 
 Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . 
 There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . 
 You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! 
 Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . 
 Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking . 
 When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising . 
 No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking . 
 How did you finally do it ? 
 Like snacking ? 
 I get what you mean . 
 I'm impressed . Good for you ! 
 I didn't know you did Yoga . 
 What have you learned ? 
 As opposed to short and shallow ? 
 I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' 
 I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? 
 That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? 
 What's the regular price ? 
 Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . 
 By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . 

Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? 
 Well , come over and talk to me then . 
 May I turn on the TV then ? 
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . 

Where is your dressing room ? 
 ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ? 
 Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 . 
 Do you have a credit card with us ? 
 If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today . 
 No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know . 
 Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 Yes . It cost $ 7 , and it takes one day . 
 Thank you , and have a great day . 
 Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? 
 I can try to arrange that for you . 
 Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? 
 You're in luck . We still have that little table . 
 Yeah . Can I look at this ring ? 
 I believe I am a six . 
 Would you have any necklace that would go well with this ? 
 There's no price tag on this necklace . 
 This necklace is a little short . Do you have one that is longer ? 
 This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ? 
 Let me think about it . 
 Thank you for all the help . 

The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . 
 Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! 
 Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . 
 Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! 

I've never been to a restaurant like this before . 
 That's a good word to describe it . 
 I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . 
 I'm in the mood for a Californian . 

Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ? 
 Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work ! 
 Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ? 
 Jeans and a tee shirt , right ? 

Ah , here we are . 
 Would you like to sit near the window ? 
 Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ? 

What can I get for you today , sir ? 
 Would you like anything else with that ? 
 Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious . 
 Is this to stay or to go ? 

Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? 
 I don't know how to say it in English . 
 Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ? 

Would you mind giving me a hand ? 
 Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ? 
 Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please . 
 There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight . 

Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? 
 Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . 
 What's that ? 
 And after that ? 

Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . 
 Early this morning . 
 Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . 
 The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . 

Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . 
 I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw . 
 No , not really , there's just a lot of blood . 
 I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk . 

This is 911 . 
 Slow down and tell me your address . 
 An ambulance is on its way right now . They should be there any minute . Are you close to him right now ? 
 Is he breathing ? 

Bob , would you come and help me ? 
 Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ? 
 Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow . 
 I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . 

Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? 
 Oh , Would you do me a favor ? 
 Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . 
 Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost . 
 Thanks . 

Good afternoon . 
 I've got this important letter to send to Hainan . Can I send it by registered mail ? 
 How much will I have to pay ? 
 Here are the letter and the money . 
 Is it overweight ? 
 All right . Here is the money . 
 What shall I do with the receipt ? 
 Thank you . 

Can I help you , Miss ? 
 What is your skin type ? 
 This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand . 
 $ 60.The price is reasonable for its large quantity . What's more , there are some gifts attaching for you . 
 You can take one tonic or hand cream . 
 No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it . 

Excuse me . Can you show me some nail-polish ? 
 That's good . 
 In my opinion , orange is very nice . 
 You're right . Well , just these two , please . 
 No , thanks . 
 I know how you feel . I had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago . Fortunately , the one we have now is very nice . 
 Could we have the bill , please ? 
 That's alright . Here you are . 
 What happened ? 

Can you give me a hand , Tom ? 
 Can you open this bottle for me ? The cork seems to be stuck . 

Don't tell me that's your lunch ? 
 A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! That's all junk ! 
 Sugar , sugar , preservatives , fats , more sugar , more fat , more preservatives ! 
 My wife sent me with rice , vegetables , and some curry chicken . 

Can you shorten this pipe for me ? It's too long . 
 Can you take 15 mm of it ? 

Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? 
 I'm really interested . Tell me about them . 
 That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . 
 Why don't we do that anymore ? 

Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? 
 Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? 
 I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed . 
 Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . 

( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ? 
 I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated . 
 A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to . 
 Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard . 
 Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car ! 
 I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal . 
 Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ? 
 I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car . 
 I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run . 
 Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany . 

Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? 
 Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? 

I'm going crazy . 
 I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Did you have anything particular in mind ? 
 Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some . 
 About how much were you planning to spend ? 
 Oh , in that case . This one is OK . 
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . 
 Could you tell me the advantages of it ? 
 There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 
 In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . 
 Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . 
 I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? 
 In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . 

Chinese tea is famous all over the world . I want to buy several boxes . 
 Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all . 
 Sounds interesting . What about this ? 
 What's this ? It smells fragrant . 
 I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend . 

Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . 
 The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . 
 All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . 
 The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . 
 OK , here you are . 
 I'm sorry - it's my fault . I was filling the bathtub and I left the water running too long , so it overflowed . 

Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . 
 An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . 
 I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . 
 Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . 
 All right . Thank you . 
 Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . 
 Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . 
 What's up ? 
 Oh , I think it is . 
 I think it's because of your bad habits ! 
 I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . 
 You should do better later . 
 Sure . Where are you ? 
 What kind of car ? 
 Where are you going to ? 
 You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . 
 About 20 to 30 minutes . 

How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets ? 
 I am glad you are happy . 

Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 Well , they are very nice you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry I couldn't help you . 
 Where did he go ? 
 Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . 
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 

What is this big box at the front door ? 
 What did you get yourself into ? 
 So , what's in the box ? A fridge ? 
 I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! 

What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . 
 Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? 
 What happened ? 
 What ? He can't do this to you . 
 What did you do ? 
 Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? 
 Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . 
 I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . 

How can I help you ? 
 Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? 
 OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes . 
 Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? 
 Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . 
 How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick . 
 How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . 
 I know what she would like-some whitening cream . 
 Will that be all then ? 

Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel . 
 How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy . 
 We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it . 
 Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic . 
 Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . 
 I bought some special local products . 
 Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . 
 Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? 
 Then I will buy some tomorrow . 
 Because I want to send them to my friends . 

Are there pets allowed in this apartment ? 
 What about a boa constrictor ? 
 If I had one , could I rent this apartment ? 
 What about a Gila monster ? 

Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . 
 I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one . 
 I know , I know . I will do it all by myself . 
 Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . 

Beth , would you like me to help you carry it ? 
 Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . 
 Sure . Let's buy it . 
 I've got them . 

What can I do for you ? 
 I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? 
 How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . 
 Do you like it ? 
 Fifty yuan . 

Where are you going , Tony ? 
 Mom said you couldn't go out . 

Has someone already helped you ? 
 Which do you like best ? 
 360 yuan . 
 Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock . 
 I can give you a 10 % discount . 
 I'm afraid that's the best we can do . 

So how far is the museum , dad ? 
 Finish your hot chocolate and we will go . 
 No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria . 
 Let's go then . On the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction . 
 Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ? 
 Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office . 
 No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 
 How much did you want to spend ? 
 Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . 
 Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now . 
 Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . 

What can I do for you ? 
 All right . This way , please . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . 
 How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . 
 350 yuan . 

Dad , do you know where Mom is ? 
 She'd better not start crying like she usually does . 
 Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . 
 That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . 

Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! 
 Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ? 
 Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . 
 I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money . 

Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . 
 I know . I miss him terribly . 
 I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . 
 No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . 

Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ? 
 Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ? 
 No more than three . 
 How about its quality ? 
 OK , what is this ? 
 It is thoughtful . I will take it . 
 Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . 
 Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . 
 How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . 
 Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? 
 Definitely beer . Two bottles . 
 Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . 
 Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines . 
 I need some stamps . 
 How much do I need for this letter ? 
 How much ? Is it overweight ? 
 How much is it , then ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . 
 Thanks for noticing . 
 I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . 
 Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . 
 Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . 
 You don't need to lose weight . 
 Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . 
 No problem . 
 Come on , John . This is my favorite show . 

I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open . 
 I think I will . 
 I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . 
 Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . 
 Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . 
 Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . 
 What happened ? 
 That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . 
 But then it'll be too warm . 

Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . 
 I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? 
 He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . 
 You're glad he saved me , huh ? 

Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . 
 Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . 
 What do you know ? You are over weight too . 
 I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . 
 C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . 
 It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . 
 Great . I'll get our plan started right away . 

I need to buy some fruit . 
 How much are the pears ? 
 Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ? 
 It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . 
 Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . 
 Here you are . 
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . 
 San Yuan . 
 I'm not used to other brands . 
 OK . I hope so . 
 Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . 
 I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? 
 It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . 
 Do you have a warranty on it ? 
 If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? 
 OK . I'll take one . 
 I want to go to the supermarket . 
 Let's get a shopping cart . 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet . 
 I'll take some , too . 
 OK . I'll go and buy some cakes . 
 No . Let's go over to the check-out stand . 
 OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? 
 Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . 
 Thank you . I'll wash them . 
 Good boy . 
 What did you do ? 
 You have a lot of plants . 
 That takes some time . 
 I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . 
 That's a lot of work . 
 I'll bet you were hungry ! 
 Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . 
 I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . 
 I don't like being too tired the next day . 
 If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . 
 Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet ! 
 You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school . 
 What about inside the school ? 
 I think our child is going to love it ! 
 We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . 
 You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours . 
 Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day . 
 No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies ! 
 Mom , I don't want to bathe today . 
 Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . 
 OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom . 
 Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too . 
 Don't worry , you'll sleep well tonight . 

Peter , it's time to get up . 
 What time is it now ? 
 Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school . 
 What should I wear today ? 
 How's the shirt ? 

Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee do you want to have ? 
 Well . We have espresso , latte , skinny latte , fancy coffee and Americano . 
 OK . Wait a minute , please . And the sugar is right over there . 
 I'd like a table for two , please . 
 No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window . 
 Fine . I'll sit here . 
 I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks . 
 Yes . I have lost about ten kilos . 
 I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly . 
 It lies in perseverance . 
 You should have a try . 
 OK . This way , please . 
 Let me see . 100 dollars . 
 Sorry . You can only pay in cash . 
 Thank you . Do you need the invoice ? 
 Sure . I'll get right on it . 
 I want to get a package of cigarette . 
 No , this kind of cigarette is too strong for me , I desire a mild one . 
 It suits my taste , I'll take it . Do you have lighters ? 
 Show me the one made of plastic . 
 Thank you . 
 I wish to buy a diamond ring . 
 I want five carats . 
 No , it seems too old-fashioned to my fiancee . 
 It seems too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? 
 Oh , this one is perfect . 
 Hold on 
 Hello , Is that Stefan ? 
 Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there . 
 That can't be true . I remember the number clearly . Is your number 1199886 ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry . 
 Sorry again for bothering you . 

Hello , Can I speak to Tom , please ? 
 May I ask what time he will come back ? 
 I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number . 
 Thank you very much . Bye . 

Hello ! 
 Speaking . 
 Hello , George.What ' s up ? 
 Good morning , sweetie . You finally got up . 
 Did you stay up late last night ? 

Peter , it's time to eat breakfast . 
 Alright , you'd better hurry , your bus is coming . 
 Oh , dear , go get another pair . I'll help you change your shorts . 
 Give me a break . 
 Mom , there isn't any hot water 
 It's getting cold . 

Mom , I'm ready for school . 
 I know , mom . 
 Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ? 
 But it's still early . 
 But Day . I'm not sleepy . 

Good evening . What'll you have ? 
 Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Of course . Wait for a moment , please . 
 Do you have any homework today ? 
 Go and do it now . 

Welcome to our bar ! 
 Here is the wine list . 
 What would you like ? 
 What about cocktail ? 
 I recommend Mao Tai , it's the best liquor in China . 
 Here you are , sir . 

How was school today ? 
 Really , that's good . 
 They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it . 
 You know I don't know anything about fashion . 
 Well , they are both all right . 
 Oh , no . I mean you look very nice in both of them . 
 But after all , it is your decision , not mine . 

What can I do for you ? 
 OK . This way , please . 
 We've particularly busy on Sunday . Please sit here . How do you wish it cut ? 
 It's a long time since you had a haircut last time , isn't it ? 
 How long ago ? 

Good afternoon , Miss . 
 What style do you want ? 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Yes , Miss . Is that all right ? 
 And would you like a manicure ? 
 One hundred yuan , please . 
 Thank you . 
 I want my hair cut . 
 I'm not sure . What do you suggest ? 
 I don't like it . It's outdated . 
 It seems a little too wild . 
 I want a haircut just like that kind . 

I want to ask you for a favor . I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing , but as a foreigner , I don't know the normal practice . Can you give me some advice ? 
 I am a student and want to live in Haitian , so that I can live close to my school . I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study . 
 That sounds great ! 
 Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . 
 Good morning . May I help you ? 
 Yes . Here's a booking form . Please write down the number you wish to call , the name of the person you want to talk to , and your own name for our reference . 
 It's hard to say . It depends on how busy the lines are . Please take a seat over there . We'll try to put you through as soon as possible . 

May I help you ? 
 How do you want to send it ? 
 Is there anything valuable ? 
 They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English . You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms . 
 Have you written down your return address ? 

Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ? 
 I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission . 
 Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days . 
 Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ? 
 OK . I will send them now . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it . 
 I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen . 
 Each of both . 
 Here you are . 
 Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ? 
 Great . How much ? 
 Thank you . I will deal with it . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 What's in it , please ? 
 OK . please fill in this form and label it . 
 Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ? 
 Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change . 
 You are welcome . 
 I'd like to send a fax to Shanghai . 
 Document . 
 Here you are . 
 How long will it take to get to Shanghai . 
 Oh , excellent . How much does it cost ? 

I want to have this photo enlarged . 
 I want to have it the size of a page from an ordinary book . 
 One is OK . How much does it cost ? 
 Here's twenty yuan . 

Which window do I go to for parcel ? 
 I want to mail this package . 
 Zhuhai . 
 What's the difference in price ? 
 How long will it take by air ? 
 Then I will send it by air , thank you . 
 Just some souvenirs . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course . This camera is easy to operate . 
 It's made in China . 
 Not very expensive . 
 OK . Do you want any film ? 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Please show me your parcel order . 
 Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel . 
 Not at all . 
 You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of necklaces for you to choose from . 
 Do you mean the exquisite golden necklace ? 
 It costs only two thousand yuan . 
 Yes , it is , and the lustre will never fade out . 

Mary , do you often do your shopping online ? 
 How about the price ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy some clothes online , but I didn ’ t know how to pay for them . 
 Are there many things online ? 

Hi Brittany . What are you doing with all of your clothes on your bed ? 
 Oh , A . Mom didn't tell you ? 
 This Bs ' school you're going to is going to make your life easy . 
 Uniforms , sis , no more worrying about appearances ! 

I'd like to return this radio . 
 I lost it . 
 But I purchased it yesterday . 
 Well , that's a start , I guess . 
 That sounds good . I'll take the escalator . 

Hello . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Sure . 
 No problem . I'm gonna need you to turn off your engine and open the hood for me . 
 Your oil is fine but your tires are a little flat . 
 Right here . I'll do it for you . ( Three minutes later ) Your car's ready . 
 Nine gallons of premium . That's $ 15.32 , please . 
 I would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend . 
 This pair is Rolex , right ? 
 What function does this watch have ? 
 Sounds good . 
 How long is the guarantee ? 
 How much does the pair cost ? 
 It is a bit expensive . But it is worth buying one's favorite . I will take them . 
 Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke . 
 That's fine . 
 Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ? 
 Thanks . 
 OK , it so happened I want to buy one . 
 I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ? 

I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet . 
 Wow ! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you . 
 How did you do it ? 
 I hate working out . 
 Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ? 

Hello . I'd like to speak to Susan . 
 Isn't this the Whites ? 
 I'm calling 6667777 . Maybe my finger slipped and I touched the wrong number . 
 Oh , sorry to have bothered you . 
 Bye ! 
 What is your address , sir ? 
 OK , someone will be there by 12:15 . 
 Let me just park my car in a better position . Alright , miss . Where ’ s the luggage ? 

I'm planning on going to the market soon . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I'll make a list . 
 OK ! Do we need any meat ? 
 What else do we need ? 
 Is there anything else that we need ? 

What can I help you with today ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like . 
 How does this afternoon at 2:30 sound to you ? 
 Alright , so I'll see you then ? 

I am really interested in buying this television . 
 How much are you selling it for ? 
 You can't be serious . 
 That's too expensive for me . 
 You can't go down on the price ? 
 I'll buy it for $ 2000 . 

I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . 
 Mangoes . What are they ? 
 Can you eat the nut ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What does a mango taste like ? 
 How do I know if it's ripe ? 
 Where do they come from ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 Sure . The local train . It stops at every station . 
 You take the D train on the downtown platform , and go three stops . 
 One dollar and twenty cents . You give me the money and I ’ ll exchange it for a token . 
 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . 
 Morning . 
 Yes . You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 . 
 Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Better take the subway . It ’ s faster , and more convenient . 
 Just go to the ticket office in the subway . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 
 Yes , how much is the teapot ? 
 I'm afraid I haven't got enough money on me . 
 What's the time now ? 
 I want to know at what time you close . 
 Oh , that's great ! Thank you . 
 I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . 
 There is a square in front of us , we can park the car there . 
 I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too . 
 No , that's too risky . 

Hey Jimmy . Let's go workout later today . 
 How about at 3:30 ? 
 Hey . I just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . Let's work out on arms and stomach today . 
 C'mon . We're only switching two days . You can do legs on Friday . 

Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the post office ? 

Well , Mitzuko-san , I hope you like it here . This is my favourite restaurant in Taipei . It reminds me of my youth when I traveled around Europe . 
 The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here . 
 Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good . 
 Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor . 
 Oh , that means soup of the day . I'll ask the waiter what they have today . Have you tried mussels cooked the Italian way ? They're really delicious . 

But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music ! 
 Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ? 

Hey Michael . Where are you going ? 
 What for ? 
 Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? 

Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 And to drink ? 
 Is this dine-in or take-out ? 

Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? 
 I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough . 
 It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning . 
 I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? 
 O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . 
 See you . 
 I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ? 
 I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ? 
 I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons . 

Hey Michael . Where are you going ? 
 What for ? 
 Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? 

All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health . 
 For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise . 
 That's not a bad idea . How much is it ? 
 Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , that ’ s very sad . 
 What did you do ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 
 Yeah , me too . 
 No , not yet . Is it good ? 
 Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now . 
 So what's the movie about ? 
 Huh ? 
 I see . Batwoman married the boss ? 
 Wait a minute , I'm lost . The cop killed the boss ? 
 And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ? 

Hi Mike . What have you been up to ? 
 Trying to get in shape ? 
 Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ? 
 I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously . 
 Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy . 

Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car . 
 When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is . 
 Is it serious ? 
 And when will it be OK ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Not back home for dinner again ? That's the third time this week ! 
 You don't have to explain . Suit yourself . 
 We'll see . 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Regular or unleaded ? 
 How many gallons do you want ? 
 All right . Shall I check the oil ? 
 You're a quart low . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Yeah , I've been working out a lot . 
 For a year and a half . 
 Has it been that long ? 
 I usually go every other day for about 3 hours . 
 Yeah , I used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week , and I saw no results . This is what you have to do to get noticeable results . 
 Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . 
 When I have some time , I like to exercise . 
 I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago . 
 I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes . 
 I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once . 
 I want to get my car washed . 
 I don't know what you mean . 
 Do you wash windows ? 
 What about the interior ? 
 Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK . 

This looks wonderful , Madame Culot . 
 Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ? 
 Mmm . Maybe another time . 
 Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ? 
 I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ? 
 Oh , yes . That would be lovely . 
 Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . 

Welcome . Can I help you with anything ? 
 Let's see . How about a nice shirt and tie ? You can't go wrong there . 
 We have some nice pants . You can also get him a belt with it . 
 These slacks are very popular . He can wear them to dress up a little or on a normal casual day . 
 Yes . Right over here . 
 The pants are on sale for $ 40 , and the belt is $ 25 . 
 Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you . 

What happened to your car ? 
 Are they going to pay you for the damages ? 
 What the hell . That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ? 
 That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . 
 Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . 

Excuse me . Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is ? 
 Is it far from here ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 About how long will it take me to get there ? 
 I see . Is there a bus I can take ? 
 Thank you so much for your help . 

Welcome home , Peter ! 
 So , how was your trip to Thailand ? 
 Yes , there are three stops left . 
 Well , you will get there in about a quarter of an hour if the traffic isn ’ t too heavy . 
 Sure , madam . I ’ ll remind you . 
 At the supermarket down the street . Help yourself . 

There's plenty left . Would you like another helping ? 

That was delicious . 
 Thanks , but I couldn't eat another bite . I'm really full . 
 Just a few cookies . 

Let's take a break . 
 Sounds good . 
 I want to post this package to the United States . 
 By sea . 
 Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ? 
 I want to send it by express mail . The faster , the better . 
 Here you go . 
 Thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 I do yoga twice a weeks 
 It was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . It makes me flexible . 
 Yes , I often go swimming . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 I'm figuring out my budget . 
 I'm making a shopping budget , so that I don't spend too much money . 
 I can only spend $ 300 a month . 
 I need to save the rest . 
 I need to pay my bills . 
 I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope . 
 Sure . Do you want to have the car washed ? 
 You can pick it up in half an hour . By the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ? 

I want to find an old music box . 
 Do you have anything made in the 1920s ? 
 Do any of them have dancing figures ? 
 That's fantastic . I think I like this one . 
 Now , is there any warranty with this ? 
 I understand . 

I would like to exchange this dress . 
 Is there anything on sale today ? 
 Are dresses going to be on sale ? 
 That's great . I'll wait . See you next weekend . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Please take a seat . Do you need a shampoo ?

I am looking for a pan . 
 A big one would be nice .

 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 

Can you tell me where the produce is ? 
 Do you know what produce is on sale ?

 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 So , you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ?

 Here's my VISA . 

What do you think ? 
 I would like to purchase it . 
 Here , take my credit card . 
 Sure . Here you go .

 It shouldn't be a problem . 

Hi , I'd like to return this radio . 
 Here it is . 
 It does not work very well . 
 No . I'd just like a refund . 

How much is this shirt ? 
 It's rather expensive , isn't it ? 
 How about 50 yuan ? 
 Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ? 
 All right . 
 Maybe you should look around for an outlet . 
 Outlets have more reasonable prices . 
 No problem . Good luck . 
 With pleasure . What color do you like ? 
 It costs 275 yuan , Miss . 
 Sorry , we don't give discounts . 

Pardon me . Could you help me ? 
 I am looking for a sweater . 
 Medium , I think .

May I help you ? 
 I'm afraid you can't . 
 It's 100 % cotton . 
 It's already reduced 20 % . 
 Yes . Please come this way . 
 Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . 
 Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all !

Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking !

 Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on . 
 Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .

Could you show me the way to the railway station ? 
 Would you like to be my guide ? 

Do you have some good ideas of losing weight ? 
 Any more ? 
 Got it . 
 Well , it seems that I should do some jogging from tomorrow on . 
 No so good . I broke traffic regulations yesterday and I got a ticket . 
 Certainly , as long as you don't tell my wife . 
 Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried . 
 I have to admit it's easier said than done . 
 But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either . 
 Actually , my doctor said the same thing . 
 You could try shopping at a flea market . 
 A flea market is an outdoor place where people sell all kinds of used stuff . 
 Well , you can check the local paper or search ‘ flea market ' online . 
 I would like to buy a new fridge . 
 I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 What appliances ? 
 May I see the inside for myself ? 
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 
 We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow . 
 What an excellent idea ! 
 OK . 
 Yes , some exercise is necessary for us . 

I need to find a new furniture set for my living room . 
 I have no idea . 
 Where did you get it from ? 
 How much did it cost you ? 
 Is the furniture sturdy ? 
 I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good . 

What's wrong with you ? 
 I really recommend you go for a run in the morning . 
 On the contrary ! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day . 
 Yes , I often feel like a million dollars after work , like I can take on anything . 

Hello , I would like to buy some business cards .

 No , the one next to it . 
 Is this a furry hat ? 
 Are you sure ? 

Good morning ! Can I help you ? 
 OK , come this way , please . How does this one fit you ? 
 Let me stretch it for you . How is that now ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thirty-five yuan . 
 Thanks . Nothing else , today ? 

Are you going to buy a bicycle ? 
 ¥ 350 . 
 Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period . 
 Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here . 
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . You ’ re welcome to pay in cash . 
 They ’ re in the cabinet next to the sink . 
 They ’ re in the cabinet above the dishwasher . 
 They ’ re in that drawer . 
 No problem . 
 It suits my taste . You are really a good cook . 
 Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Come here , please . 
 I don't like the style . 
 Black is not my favorite colour . 
 It's pretty . How much is it ? 
 It's too expensive . Can you come down a little ? 
 I'll buy it if forty . 

May I help you ? 
 We're on clearance sale now . Prices have up to twenty percent off . Do not miss the chance . 
 Madam , you know we ’ re clearing out stock now . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Thirty percent discount , OK ? That ’ s the lowest price . 
 Oh , yes . That is a beautiful color . It has been a very popular lipstick this season . I have just two left . 
 Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow . 
 I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? 

Excuse me ? 
 Well , I bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . But I got the wrong size . It ’ s too small for my daughter . I wonder if I could refund it . 
 I intended to , but as far as I know , all the skirts of this kind here are of the same size . 
 Sorry to have given you trouble . 

Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ? 
 I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ? 
 Please hold on , I'll just check with the delivery department . 

Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency . 
 Do you have any particular type of apartment in mind ? 
 Are you renting it alone or with company ? 
 A one-bedroom apartment has one bedroom , a living room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 No , but a fridge and a stove . 
 Yes , it ’ s a one-year lease . And $ 200 a week with one month refundable deposit . 
 Would Friday morning be alright ? 
 Good-bye . 
 Great . What about the surrounding area ? 
 That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ? 
 Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then . 
 OK . I just want to read the comics . 

Hi , Kerry . Did your husband make cooking for you ? 
 Really ? Was it delicious ? 
 It was the first time . You should not be so particular . 
 It ’ s true . Nowadays , men are spending more and more time in the kitchen . 

Sir , your hair is done . Anything else I can do for you ? 
 All right , sir . Would you lie back so that I can shave you ? 
 Don't worry , sir . I've never cut a customer . Shall I trim your moustache ? 
 Now , I've finished . How do you like it ? 
 20 dollars . 
 Bye-bye . Welcome to come next time ! 
 Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . 
 Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . 
 You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps . 
 Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food . 
 OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant 

Can I ask a favor of you ? 
 Would you mail this letter for me when you go to the post office ? 

Why did you buy that painting ? 
 It looks like some kind of mistake . 
 Oh . Who is the artist ? 
 Oh ! How about we hang it over here where everyone can see it ? 

Let's get this card for mom , it's funny . 
 Do you mean girly ? 
 Are you for real ? 
 I think we should each get our own card . 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly . Here's a mirror . 
 Yes . This one must fit you . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . 

Excuse me , but could I use your bathroom ? 
 Thanks . 
 Really ? You've done a good job . 
 I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ? 
 Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows ? 
 Yeah , let me have a try . 
 Just go to the end of the store . And it will be on your right . We have all the ice creams and frozen foods back there in the freezers . 
 Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you . 
 That ’ s correct . 
 I'm allergic to these things , you know . 
 Let ’ s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice . 
 OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy a color TV . 
 No . Which one do you recommend ? 
 Thank you , but I'd prefer to buy a China-made set . 
 Sky worth . 

I'm glad these batteries are on sale . 
 But that's what the ad said . 
 Oh . You're right . I misread the ad . 
 Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad . 
 Well , as long as I'm here . 

Excuse me , but is this dress on sale ? 
 Are you sure ? I'd be happy to pay the sale price today . 
 OK , I'll just check out a few other stores . 

Can I help you ? 
 What size , please ? 
 What color would you prefer ? 
 Well , the brown one is beautiful indeed , but I think the black one will suit you better . 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 Yes , it is . It's brilliant . 
 Yes , it is . But you have to be careful . 
 Only 350 yuan . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . 
 I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back . 
 My pleasure , bye ! 
 Yes , I would , as long as it's good quality . 
 OK . 
 Thank you , but I'm just looking around . How much does this skirt cost ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 Can you give me a better deal ? 
 Well , I'll give one hundred and eighty yuan for it . 
 No , this is my final offer . 

I want to buy some jewellery . 
 I should like to look at some bracelets . 
 Gold ones . 
 Pure gold ones , please . This is so beautiful . I'll take it . 
 How much is it ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Sure . Please come this way . 
 Of course . Here is the fitting room . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 You look really beautiful in it . 

I'm sorry , Julia ! I can't get home early this evening . 
 I know , darling . But I do have a lot of work to do , hope you can understand me . 
 Hello , Julia ? I can't hear you clearly . I'm afraid the line is out of order . Okay , B , listen ! How about I hang up now and call you back later ? 

I want to buy some jewellery . 
 I should like to look at some bracelets . 
 Jade ones . 
 What's the price for this one ? 
 How about seven hundred yuan ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 OK . How about this diamond necklace ? 
 Then . I'm sure you will like this one . 
 Sure . This is the warranty . The cut , color , clarity , weight and the manufacturer of the diamond are all indicated in this document . 
 I wish to buy a diamond ring . 
 Two carats . 
 No , it seems too old-fashioned . 
 Let me try it on , it's too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? 
 This fits me well , how much is it ? 
 It's reasonable . Here you are . 
 Yes , I would . 
 It's sapphire . We have only one brooch of this type . Will you try it on ? 
 Only 700 yuan . 
 How about this one ? This is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one . 
 Oh , yes . Any kind of goods are dependable as our shop is well-known throughout the city . 
 I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .

 Hello , I come to pay my water and electricity fees . 
 Here they are . 
 Do you mean that I should pay 240 yuan in total ? 
 Cash , please . Here is the money . 
 OK . Thank you . Bye-bye . 

Welcome . How can I help you ? 
 This way please . We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . 
 Your T-zone gets oily easily , but your cheeks are dry in winter . Am I right ? 
 This " Cream of Olives " is our bestseller for combination skin . You can try it on your hand . 
 All right . Anything else ? 
 My pleasure . 
 OK , I'll get it . It's for you , Jeff . 

Do you drink much ? 
 How frequently do you drink ? 
 Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . 
 I usually only have 2 beers . 
 How much can you drink ? 
 Don't you spend a lot of money then ? 
 That's true . 
 I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . 
 It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . 
 Alright . 
 Really ? OK ! 
 Very comfortable . I think I will come next time . Maybe I will take some friends . Amazing ! 

Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Very well . Please sit down here . Do you want me to cut your hair very close ? 
 It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ? 
 ( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ? 
 Anything else I can do for you , sir ? 

Hi ! Do you know what's for dinner ? I'm starving ! 
 Out ? What do you mean out ? 
 Dad and Mom ? 
 You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? 

Shall we go to the library by subway ? 
 OK . There is no subway in my city . 
 Yes . Does it operate night and day ? 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 OK , I see . 
 Yes . They are over there . 
 By weight . 6.0 cents per pound . 
 $ 4.55 , please . Anything else ? 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . I'm looking for some perfume . Do you have perfumes with a light scent ? 
 It does smell good , How much is it ? 
 OK . I'll take this one . 
 Thank you . It looks very attractive . 
 Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . 
 And it must be very particular in cooking . 
 I see . 

What kind of cuisine do you have ? 
 Hangzhou food . 
 All right . I'll take it . 
 Yes , I like using chopsticks . 
 Yes , but I don't know what soup you have . 
 Good . I prefer beef soup . 
 Save it until you've served dishes . 

Taxi . 
 I am going to the railway station . 
 Thank you . Can we get there in half an hour ? 
 My train will leave at 3:00 , I'll have to arrive there before 2:50 . 
 Can't we go faster ? 

Can you show me how to use chopsticks ? 
 Oh , it is not easy to learn ! 
 Well , I don't think I can manage with it . 
 That's good , thank you . 
 Is this the right counter for gloves ? 
 Well , let me see some of each . 
 Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . 
 Very well , I'll take these two . 
 Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . 
 Hard-boiled , please . 
 Dark , please . 
 Later will do . 
 No , that's all . Thanks . 
 That's right . 

May I have a reservation ? 
 I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . 
 I'm Chen Liang . 
 We may come at 6:30 p . m . 
 Goodbye . 
 I'm watching TV . 
 Tingling is on TV . 
 Channel 8 . 

I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . 
 Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . 
 Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . 
 Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . 
 Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . 
 Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? 
 Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . 
 Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye . 
 Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister . 
 Do you take your dog for a walk every day ? 
 And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . 
 On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us . 
 My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . 
 I agree . And it's very convenient . 
 Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . 

Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? 
 Are you good at cooking ? 
 It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! 
 Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . 
 I have the same idea as yours . 
 Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . 
 Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? 
 So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Alright , tell me what you think about this one . 
 Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ? 
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated . 
 How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? 
 That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . 
 I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you . 
 No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . 
 Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ? 
 Will you have it strong or weak ? 

Won't you have some of this ? 
 It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . 
 I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? 
 I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much . 

Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . 
 He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . 
 This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem . 
 There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . 
 What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . 
 Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . 
 I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . 
 I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . 

Good morning , Mrs . Smith . 
 What kind of books does she like ? 

Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? 
 Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . 
 Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? 
 What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . 
 OK , I promise . What is it ? 
 Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . 
 No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . 
 All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . 

There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . 
 But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . 

Hello , do you have any vacancies ? 
 What kind of apartment is it ? 

What kind of films do you like best ? 
 I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ? 
 You are sort of romantic . 
 Hi , is Heather there please ? 
 Is this 617-228-2289 ? 
 Heather Johnson . 
 Do you know where she went ? 
 Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ? 
 Oh , yes . How are you ? 
 OK . Thanks . 

I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it . 
 The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street . 
 That's why I think it may suit my needs . 
 The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ? 
 Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ? 
 Oh , that's no problem . 
 The rent is $ 1500 per month . 
 The deposit is $ 500 . 
 Oh , do you really like it ? 
 Well , it's kind of you to say so . 
 Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ? 
 OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . 
 Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . 

Hello , who's that speaking ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , it's fully furnished . 
 15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas . 
 It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station . 
 The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? 
 All right , see you . 
 Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 OK . Would you like to live in a studio ? 

Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? 
 Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . 
 It says it's located in the suburbs . 
 Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too . 
 Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . 
 OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . 
 Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . 

Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . 
 It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . 
 That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . 
 Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated . 
 No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . 
 Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there . 
 Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place . 

Good evening , Yanking Restaurant . 
 Certainly , sir . For how many people , please ? 
 Of course . May I have your name , please ? 
 Can you spell that , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye . 
 Yes . I'll have a room free next week . 
 12,000 a year , but you can't get visitors to live in . 
 Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner . 
 Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ? 
 Yes , the same service and food as in the evening . 
 OK . Your name , please ? 
 Good . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , of course . Do you like a jade necklace ? 
 Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please . 
 Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds . 
 Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful . 

Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room . 
 How much are you asking ? 
 Could I have a look at it , please ? 

I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ? 
 Fine . Will you work out the details , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 What kind of references do you need ? 
 I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ? 

When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ? 
 What time does the open house start ? 

I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK . Can I see the room now ? 

Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ? 
 Do you think any studios will open up soon ? 

What kind of lease is it ? 
 Can I have a month-to-month lease ? I only want to rent the apartment for five months . 
 Well , then I don't think this would be a good apartment for me . Thank you anyway . 

Are utilities included in the rent ? 
 Do I have to pay for electricity myself ? 

Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ? 
 The Grand hotel , is it far from here ? 

What games do you like ? 
 How about a game of bridge ? 
 What about guessing games ? 
 Let's play other game . 
 OK . 
 Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . 
 Right ? OK , got it . 
 Next left then right ? OK . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 I see . It feels very light on the skin . 
 I like the cool smell , too . 
 I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . My son played with it only twice and it broke . 
 Yes , and I have the warranty , too . 
 I'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can . 
 That's good . Thank you . 
 It's good . It's a nice room . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course and very well . 
 Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond . 
 Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight . 
 No , thanks . We have made a reservation before . 
 My name is James . 
 Thanks . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 

So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window . Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 

Sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ? 
 Yes , and they have a sale on now . 
 I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . 
 Let's go then . 
 I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive . 
 The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount . 

I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? 
 Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
 Is it good ? 
 I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . 
 What kind do you have ? 
 Make it Thousand Island . 
 Sure . We've helped more than ten thousand people buy and sell houses . We're the No . 1 realtor in this community . I recommend this house ( He points at a picture ) . 
 On a hill to the east of the Tarsus river . You have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . You can't find a better home to live in . 
 Eight rooms , a roomy kitchen , two modem bathrooms , a lovely dining room , a gorgeous living room and three sweet bedrooms . All are built with first-rate materials . 
 6 million . You needn't pay the whole price at one time . You just pay 50 % in cash . We'll process the legal documents for you and then you can borrow the other 50 % from a bank and repay it in installments . We ask for only 1 % as commission . 
 Ten thousand . 
 Hi Chris . I am glad to see you . Can you help me with my new computer ? 
 I bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning at 10:45 . 
 I am not sure . I just can't connect to the net . 
 Of course , come in . 
 It was only 345 pounds . 
 I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ? 

Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 Would you like an appetizer ? 
 Would you like some soup first ? 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Have you decided on anything ? 
 How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? 
 Are you interested in today's special ? 
 Twice cooked spicy pork slices . 
 Anything else ? 

The car isn't running smoothly . I'd like to have a look at it . 
 I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here . 
 Nothing serious . The right one needs some air . 
 Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . 
 It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . 
 You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . 
 Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . 
 Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it . 
 You're welcome . 
 No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man . 
 That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . 
 Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ? 
 The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ? 
 Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar . 
 OK . I'll have that . 
 Thank you . That's enough . 
 Thanks . 
 I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . 
 Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? 
 So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 . 
 And is that all ? 
 So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ? 
 I think £ 5 would be good . 
 Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim . 
 But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon . 
 Well , it's a window table that we've booked . 
 Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one . 
 If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here . 

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
 I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . 
 Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . 
 Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . 
 Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . 
 Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . 
 It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
 Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
 That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . 
 It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
 All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . 
 Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train . 
 Here is the Grand Central Station . 
 The meter reads 9.15 dollars . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , it's Mr . Brown . 
 Oh , this is just fine . 
 Thank you . 

Would you like to have a piece of cake ? 
 Why ? You're not fat . 
 Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . 
 Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . 
 All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . 

Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Where to , sir . 
 Star Hotel . OK . 
 About 20 minutes . 
 How much is the fare ? 

Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton . 
 No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here . 
 Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station . 
 Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ? 

Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? 
 It's a good car . 
 1999 . 
 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . 
 Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . 
 The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . 
 One month . 
 You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . 
 $ 5,900 . 
 Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . 

What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? 
 I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . 
 Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . 
 We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . 
 Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . 
 Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . 
 Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? 

Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month . 
 Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? 
 What did you do for your last move ? 
 Oh . that's very nice of him . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . 
 Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? 
 How many elevators are there ? 
 How about the car-park space ? 
 Any other facilities ? 
 What is the completion date ? 
 How about the price and the bank mortgage ? 
 How many payment methods are there ? 
 Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . 

You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . 
 Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . 

Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? 
 How often dose this bus go there ? 
 I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? 
 Where can I find the bus ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? ! 
 Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ? 
 Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano . 
 Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there . 
 Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal . 
 I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean . 

What is your favorite coffee ? 
 All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? 
 I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . 
 I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? 
 No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . 

Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? 
 I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? 

May I know where you are going ? 
 I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction . 
 Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . 
 Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . 
 Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . 

Good coming , sir . 
 Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . 

How much is the fare ? 
 Could you tell me how to use it ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? 
 Thank you for your help . 

May I try on this pair of shoes ? 
 I think it's 35 . 
 Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . 
 This is just right for me . I'll take this one . 
 Of course . How about this one ? 
 It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function . 
 Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee . 

Let's go to the cinema by bus . 
 OK , it will be a new experience for me . 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 

May I help you , sir ? 
 What color do you want ? 
 What size are you ? 
 No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you . 
 Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . 
 Is this the one you want ? 
 Here you are . 
 It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? 
 It costs $ 200 . 

Let's have a look at the map first . 
 Let's buy some tickets . 
 Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ? 

What would you have ? 
 What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head . 
 Here it is . 
 I'm always at your service . 
 Tsingtao beer ? 
 Really ? 
 How about its taste ? 
 That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please . 
 Tin , please . 
 No , thank you . 

Welcome ! 
 With ice , sir ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ? 
 Coming up immediately . 
 For what time , sir ? 
 May I have your name please , sir ? 
 Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . 
 Yes , I'll have a steak , please . 
 Rare , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 All right . What would you like to drink ? 
 Regular or large ? 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 For here or to go ? 

Waitress , can I have the bill , please ? 
 Do you accept credit cards ? 
 Master card . Here you go . 

Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What flavor would you prefer , sir ? 
 We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana . 
 Anything else , sir ? 

I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . 
 What does it come with standard ? 
 Cruise control ? I don't like that . 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . 
 I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 
 I see . 
 Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . 
 We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . 
 I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? 
 Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . 
 You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . 
 Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . 
 Would you like to have a taste of Moutan ? 
 Yes , you con order some typical Chinese dishes . For example , Roast Beijing Duck . 
 Yes , it is the best of our hotel . 
 Thank you . Just a moment , please . 
 Hello , I am Amy . 
 I saw that your Corollas are on sale . 
 Tell me about Corollas . 
 Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ? 
 I am serious . $ 15,000 . 
 No . Just talk to your manager and let me know . 
 The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . 
 Thanks ! 
 Yes , please . 
 What's the price difference ? 
 Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please . 
 Yes , I would . Thanks a lot . 
 How about some Zongzi ? 
 Well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves . 
 Do you want some stuffed bun ? It's delicious , too . 
 Anything else ? 
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes . 

May I take your order ? 
 I'm afraid this course is for four persons . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . 
 I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes . 
 Would you like rice with your meal ? 
 Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . 
 Very well . 
 I want egg soup . 
 I'd like to have some meat . 
 No , thank you . 
 What is it ? 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 No , thank you 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . Why don't you try it today ? 
 Would you like to have a drink ? 
 Anything else ? 
 OK . I'll be back soon . 
 Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . 

Hello , can I help you ? 
 How long has it been on for ? 
 You can still drive , without problems . 
 Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair . 
 Please write down your address and phone number , and sign here . 
 It'll be about an hour . Are you going to wait ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , my brakes are not working well . 
 I hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake . 
 I think so . 
 Toyota Corolla 2002 . 
 Do you charge for checking it out ? 
 How long is it going to take ? 
 I'll wait . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a share of steak . 
 I like it well-done , please . 
 One Whisky . 

Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
 You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . 
 Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . 

I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? 
 I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ? 
 Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . 
 Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . 
 So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level . 
 That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too . 
 We haven't decided yet . Could you give us a little longer ? 
 Can we get something to drink ? We want two bottles of beer . 
 Could you tell us your specials today ? 
 We'll take this steak dinner . 
 Peas and carrots . 
 Icecream , please . 
 I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ? 
 Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists . 
 Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . 
 Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . 
 Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . 

I think I need some iced water , too . Is there an extra charge for that ? 
 That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ? 
 Yes . I would also like some sweet-and-sour sauce and pepper . 
 Do I owe you for the sauce , pepper and napkins ? 

Can I take your order ? 
 What kind of drink do you want with those meals ? 
 You can super-size your meals for only three dollars extra . 
 How about anything for dessert , like an apple pie or ice cream ? 

May I help you ? 
 You need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the flyer . 
 Your total comes to $ 7 . 
 Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . 

A table for two , please . 
 Thank you . It's fine . 
 What do you recommend ? We'd like some of your local specialities . 
 One cream of fish soup and two portions of prawns . 
 No , I think it's enough . 
 A juice and a coke . 
 No . This time I'll try Chinese wine . 
 Do people here drink a lot of liquors ? 
 Yes , it has . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of " Tequila Sauta " ? 
 Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . ) 
 They say that Showing wine tastes quite good . What's it ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time . 

Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ? 
 What's the price ? 
 Can you make it any cheaper ? 
 I'll take it if you give me a discount . 
 OK . I'll take the blue one . 
 Yes , sir . What price range do you have in mind ? 
 I see . Let me show you some samples of various qualities . This one is very nice . It's three hundred and fifty dollars . 
 We are having a sale now . The price has already gone down . 
 It's two hundred and eighty dollars . 

Fill it up with premium , please . 
 No , that's OK . How much do I owe you ? 

Fill it up , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't have time . How much is that ? 

Good evening . How many people of your party ? 
 For buffet ? 
 Thirty for each adult , twenty each kid . 
 Please go to the tables over there for cold dishes and vegetables . The hot dishes are on the other side . 
 Not for soft drinks . But we charge ten yuan for each alcohol order . 
 Airmail or surface mail ? 
 Oh , anything up to 3 or 4 months for surface mail . It depends on the sailing of the ships . Airmail would only take 1 to 2 weeks . 
 Just let me weigh it for you . That's 2 lb . and 6 oz . That's be £ 10 . 

May I help you ? 
 Yes . What colors do you like ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Of course . This product moisturizes at the same time . 

May I have your order now ? 
 The courses for our regular dinner are , appetizer , soup , beef steak , dessert and coffee . 
 What kind of dessert do you want ? 
 Yes , we have . 
 Wait for a moment , I'll come back soon . 
 I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . 
 Tim Chen . 
 The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 . 

What's the rate for a station wagon ? 
 Good . I'll take it right now , if possible . 
 Of course . I have my own license and an international license . 

How much is it to rent an economy car ? 
 Could I have one for tomorrow morning ? 
 Sure . Here it is . 

How much does it cost to rent a mid-size car ? 
 Fine . I'd like to reserve one for next Tuesday .

 Yes , can we help you ? 
 What sort of problem ? 
 Is the wet patch just in one place ? 
 Did you look in the attic ? 
 Is there easy access to the attic ? We'd better look since there may be some flooding there as well . 
 OK , we can come early this afternoon . Is anyone going to be at home ? 
 Right , we have an urgent job this morning but we should finish around lunch time . We will then come straight over to your house .

 Well , it's too close to the door . Is that table reserved ? 

My car has broken down . Could someone come right away and check it ? 
 I am on Route 80 , a few miles east of the University of Utah .

 Of course not.There are so many people here today . 

Excuse me , we have book table 6 . Would you please come and tidy the table ? 
 Thank you . Could we have the menu , please ? 

My parents are always saying I am not good enough . 
 They say my hair is too long , my room is too dirty and I am not good enough at school . 
 I don ’ t think they are right . I have tried my best and that's enough . It is unfair that they are always saying these thing . Sometimes I even feel deeply hurt . 
 No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station . 

May I take your order now ? 
 I recommend the roast pork chops . 

Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . 
 Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? 
 A little , I wish I could do that . 
 Look at him , he's buff . 
 How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? 
 That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . 

Do you have coffee shops in China , too ? 
 You like to go to these places , don ’ t you ? 
 Do you often go there alone ? 

A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . 
 Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . 
 I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . 
 Here you are . 
 Sure . I think filet steak will be a good choice . It's the best local food . 

I'd like to try the chef's special . 
 I am on a diet . Do you have a vegetarian menu ? 
 Oh . I see . I would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding . 
 The crab soup is quite delicious.It ' s always a favorite with our customers . 
 Well , why not try Spaghetti Bolognese ? 

Steven , I am ready for breakfast . 
 It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan . 
 That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it . 
 I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan . 
 Don't worry . It's only ten to seven . You must have forgotten to set your watch back . 
 Yeah . Keep on eating your breakfast . You can catch the early bus . 

Would you please bring us a menu ? 
 Western food . 

May I take yor order now ? 
 We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ... 
 OK , sir . Do you want some soups ? 
 I feel like having some dumplings . Let's go out to eat . 
 Of course . What do you want me to do ? 
 I can do that . And I would like to make dumplings later . 
 Absolutely . 
 I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows ) 
 I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid . 
 We really don't need to . 
 Give me some time to think about it . 
 It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . 
 Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . 
 Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive . 

Darling , this dress is for you . I hope you like it . 
 Your birthday is coming , and I think this dress suits you . Why not try it now ? 
 It fits me exactly . How does it look like ? 
 The most important thing is that you bought it for me . I am happy that you know my size and style . 

Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course . 
 I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice . 
 That's great , bring me a bottle of that please . 
 Sure . I will clean the glasses for you . 
 Walk straight and turn left . 
 Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . 
 What about cats ? They are more independent . 
 How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
 Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . 
 It's fried sole . 
 Sure . Please wait for a moment . 
 Yes , can you recommend some steak ? 
 OK I will try it . Do you have a small portion ? I am afraid I can't finish the large one . 

Would you like something to drink ? 
 Here you are . 
 Wait a moment . 
 Yes , I am . Could I have the bill , please ? 
 Do you accept check ? 
 Well , I'd like to pay by cash . 
 Thanks . 

May I take your order ? 
 Anything else ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 Well , since you have order the roast chicken . I suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . It can help you digest the food . 
 I think whiskey will be a good choice . 
 Sure . What kind of toast do you like ? 
 We have white toast , whole wheat toast and rye toast . 
 Anything to drink ? 

Bring me some toast , please . 
 Spread some jam , please . 
 Black coffee is fine . 
 I want to buy some records . 
 Are there the records of Michael Jackson ? 
 Oh . it's too late . Maybe I should go to other video stores to have a look . 
 I'd like to try some Chinese food . 
 I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food . 
 Really ? So do you have some specialties ? 
 All right . I'll have them . 
 Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . 
 Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . 
 Sure , you want a continental one or an American one ? 
 OK , sir , yours will be ready in a few seconds . 
 Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . 
 Yes , what kind do you have ? 
 I think French will be fine . 
 No , I don't , do you ? 
 But , I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins . 
 Because it's better , easier and cheaper to get them from the food we eat . 
 Is there any difference ? 
 I think I would like the former one . 
 Roast pork chops with a bottle of red wine , please . Is soup served here ? 
 Clear soup . I think tomato soup is fine . 
 Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her . 
 I have no idea . 
 But rose is too common . 
 It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please . 
 Of course . 
 Do you take dressing on your salad ? 

How do you like the food ? 
 Yes . I made it this afternoon . Would you like some more ? 
 Oh . Would you like some soup instead ? 
 Tomato and rice . Have you had that before ? 
 It's good , try it . What do you think ? 
 Yes . 
 Thanks , next time I'll make chicken soup for us . 
 No , I learned by myself . I have a good cook book that I read when I have time . 
 Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ? 
 You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . 
 It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods . 
 Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner . 
 That's all right . 
 Yes , we have many kinds of pies and puddings . 
 Sure . We have lemon pies , apple pies , coffee rum pies and ice cream . 

What would you want , coffee or tea ? 
 How do you like it ? 

And anything to drink ? 
 How do you like your coffee ? 
 Then how about the wine ? Is white wine OK ? 

I like Chinese food . 
 At school , we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch . 
 My mother can make some Chinese food . 

Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us . 
 By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend . 

Annie , do you like shopping online ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it . 
 Are there many things online ? 
 That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ? 
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . 
 Sure . Wait for a moment . Here you are . 
 Here is the menu . 
 I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . 
 Sorry , sir . We have never done that before . 
 Here is the coffee , toast and bacon . Do you like fried eggs or poached ones ? 
 Of course . They will be ready in a few minutes . 
 Yes , Sir , the specialty of our restaurant is the seafood . 
 Perhaps you would like some sole . Many guests like it very much . 
 Any drinks ? 

Excuse me , sir , your steamed crabs is coming . 
 Mix a little soya sauce , vinegar and sliced ginger on this plate and dip the meat in it before eating . 

Is anybody here ? 
 Quite a lot . I need one pound of potatoes , three pints of milk , a dozen eggs and one pound of tomatoes . 
 How much are the lemons ? 
 Give me a dozen lemons . 
 No , thanks . How much in total ? 

Are you being served , sir ? 
 Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . How about these ones ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Ninety dollars . 
 But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more . 
 Please wait a minute , sir . 
 Sure . What do you want to have today ? 
 How do you like your steak ? 
 Well , there are several kinds of steaks . For example , you can have your steaks medium-rare , medium-well or well-done . 

You look so excited . What happened ? 
 So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . 
 I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . 

Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . 
 I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ? 
 You can tell me here . I just want to know the price . 
 I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit . 
 I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car . 
 Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car . 
 Hum ... OK . I will take it . 
 May I have a look at that china tea set ? It is extremely beautiful . 
 Jingdezhen ? Oh , I know it . Isn't it called the capital of porcelain ? 
 Oh , it must be very precious . Is it breakable ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Oh , it is beyond my purse . 
 Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks . 
 I'd like it medium-well . 

What do you like for dessert ? 
 Yes . 
 OK . I will bring it for you . 
 Have you got any Chinese paintings ? 
 I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . 
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . I like this picture very much . How much is it ? 
 It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it . 
 Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is . 
 I understand , officer . I guess it's just not my day today . I will accept the fine . 
 Oh , my God . It ’ s beautiful . But it looks expensive . 
 I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ’ t have a rich daddy . 

Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot . 
 No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it . 
 It's no big deal . Thank you . 
 Yes . A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence . But now I get it . 
 Yes , it can be quite tough . Many people fail to pass the test at the first time . 
 You should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . After you pass both tests , you'll get your licence . 
 Don't worry about your driving test . I think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon . 

Have you decided on something ? 
 Sure . Anything else ? 
 Potato chips and French dressing . 
 Yes . Fill it up , please . 
 I don't really know . I have just bought this new car . And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it . 
 Premium , please . Thanks . Please fill it up . 
 OK , thanks . 
 Good . How much does it come to ? 
 OK . Here you are . 

Everything is OK now , doctor .

Waiter , we have been waiting for 20 minutes . Would you mind hurrying ? 
 That's fine . Would you please bring me some wine ? 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 Not so delicious as before , but it's fine . The soup is tasty but the meat is a little tough . 

Do you like the food here ? 
 I am glad you like it . 
 Sure . It's $ 100 . 
 Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . 
 It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair . 
 Only old women like that . 
 OK . That's what I can do . 
 Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks . 
 Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun . 

Good afternoon , how may I help you ? 
 Who are they for ? 
 What kind of flowers would you like ? 
 OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?

 I think I should be more careful next time . 
 I am preparing a birthday party for Julia . 
 Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ? 
 Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy . 

Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ? 
 That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show . 
 No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . 
 Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu . 

Here is your bill . It's $ 60 . 
 It's for the drinks . 
 Sure . 
 It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves 
 Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . 

Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ? 
 No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it . 
 She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift . 

Do you want some dessert ? 
 Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 . 

Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ? 
 First , put away your toys . 
 I'll get the flour out . 

What's on Channel 12 at 8: 00 ? 
 Do you want to watch it ? 

Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ? 
 Are you going with your friends ? 
 Oh , aren't you afraid ? 
 I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous . 

Waiter , please make out the bill . 
 Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak . 
 Here is the money . 
 Yes , I think even though we are adults , it's still a good place for us to relax . 
 I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ? 
 Come on . Here is for enjoying and exciting . 
 I like ferris wheel more . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? 
 Then I recommend this package to you . You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month . 
 Sending a message ' KTCTWY ' to 10086 will do . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Let me see ... it's $ 50 . 
 Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only . 

Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ? 
 Hurry up , the show is about to start . 
 Yes , I love to see the animal show . 
 I'm sure you'll love it . 

Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? 
 Does this bus go there ? 
 Let's step in , Dad . 
 Dad . Here comes another bus . 
 Why ? Dad ? 

There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask . 
 When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ? 

Waiter , can I have the bill please ? 
 We'd prefer separate checks . 

Hello , could I make a reservation ? 
 6 o'dock in the evening . 
 Do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ? 
 Then we will come here for lunch tomorrow . 
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . 
 Just a moment . Let me find out . Our manager Wil be here in a minute . So will you speak to him ? 

Switchboard . Which extension would you like ? 
 I'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . Just hold on , please . 
 Certainty , sir . 
 Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . 
 Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . 
 No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . 
 It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . 

Can I help you ? 
 Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . 
 Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . 
 Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? 
 Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . It's an excellent system . 
 Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . 
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . 
 Yes . 
 That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? 
 Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . 
 There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . 
 No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . 
 You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . 
 Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . 
 That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . 

What would you like for your main dish ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 Of course . 
 Which airport , ma'am ? 
 All right , ma'am . Need any help with your luggage ? 

How about going swimming ? 
 Why don't we go down to the pool ? It's not too far from here . 

Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ? 
 I am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . Are you free tomorrow ? 
 Well , I can't hear you . 
 Yes . Where do you want to go ? 
 This is the right bus . 
 Certainly.Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops . 

Anything else , sir ? 
 That'll be fifty-five dollars and twenty cents . 
 Oh , no , sir . We already gave you a discount on each item . 

May I see that ivory horse ? 
 It's genuine , I bet . 
 I'll take it . 
 The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction . 
 No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . 
 Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ? 

Hello . Can I speak to Alice , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Would you tell her Tom Gray called ? 

Would you give me some fruits ? How much are these oranges ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Well , I'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ? 
 I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial . 
 That's all.Thank you . 
 Could I have a look at those pens ? 
 Have you got anything a bit cheaper ? 
 No , they're not quite what I want . Sorry to trouble you . 

Can I have my money back on this skirt ? 
 Yes , this is defective . See ? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it . 
 If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . 

What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . What's your size ? 
 All right . Let me see . I think you'd wear a size 8 . This shirt is size 8 . 
 Sure . The fitting room is over there . 

I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . 
 Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . 

Have you got any outdoor interests ? 
 Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me . 

Do you want to buy something here ? 
 This one is two hundred yuan . 

What do you want to do tonight ? 
 I have no idea . Do you think we're in a rut ? 
 Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ? 
 Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . 
 I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? 
 Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . 
 What kinds do you have ? 
 Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please . 
 Why ? 
 But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . 
 You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . 
 But where do I get a ticket ? 
 Oh , I wish I didn ’ t have so much to carry . 
 The ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir . 
 Then I'm afraid there's none in stock . 
 They come in packages of ten or twenty . 
 On counter three . 
 I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here . 
 This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . 
 The collar ? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai . 
 250 Yuan . 
 But it is really worthwhile . 
 Here you are . 

Excuse me , which way is to the post office ? 
 Well , thanks anyway . 
 A one-way ticket to Chicago , please . 
 One adult , please . 

I'm interested in Chinese antiques . 
 I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . 
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . 

What did you say your stop was ? 
 Oh , then you should have gotten off at the last stop . 
 But don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk back . It's not far . 
 Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! 
 How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . 
 You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . 
 No , it isn't . 
 Oh , no . This is going in the opposite direction . 
 I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station . 

Excuse me , where is the Beijing Railway Station ? 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ? 
 Excuse me , sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No . It's only a five-minute walk . You can't miss it . 
 You're welcome . 
 Twenty dollars and sixty cents . 
 No way . Look . That's what the meter says . 

What can I show you ? 
 Let me check . Yes , we have . 
 Sure . Let me help you . 
 Why not ? If I were you , I certainly would . 
 As the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , you know ? 

Hello , Oriental Hotel . 
 I'm sorry , Mr . Baker is not in . May I take a message ? 
 All right , Mr . Cook . I'll have Mr . Baker call you back as soon as he gets here . 
 Until when ? 
 No problem . 
 It really depends on when and how long . 

Would you mind doing something for me ? 
 Will you please explain the meaning of this word ? 

Hello , Elizabeth . How are you ? 
 Are you sure you're all right ? You look a bit worried today . Is anything wrong ? 
 Of course , if I can . 
 Oh dear ! That's terrible ! What was in your wallet ? 
 Well , if were you , I'd go to the police station straight away and report it . 
 Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ? 
 I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily , saying when and where you lost it . 
 Wait a minute ! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre . I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it . You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later . 
 Certainly , but will it take long ? 
 OK . I'll look after it then . 
 I'm looking for a black , leather bag . 
 I'm just looking . 

Can I help you ? 
 Ten Yuan . 
 One Yuan . 
 And here's your change . Please check if it is correct . 
 Welcome to come again . 

Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing . 
 Mary , you say something about it . 

Can I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 Then please look at this suit . 
 Yes , we have some in blue , green , black and brown . 
 US $ 138 . 

Welcome to our shop . It seems you are interested in this dress . 
 That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women . 
 88 Yuan . 

You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . 
 It was made in Jingdezhen . 
 You are right . 
 It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . 
 But it is really worth the price . 
 You've come to the right place . We've got various styles and sizes recently . How much do you measure around your waist ? 
 OK ! 2 Chi round . Try this one . Maybe it's of your size . 
 Let me check the stock . How about this one ? 
 150 Yuan . 
 Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again . 
 Certainly , do you have your school schedule ? The books are arranged by course number and instructor . 

Say , what's you favorite sport ? 
 Do you know how to skate , like a skater ? 
 Then you must know a lot about skating . 
 Oh , thank you very much . 
 Yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . Do you have any small change ? 

What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ? 
 Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style . 
 I think it is . 
 I prefer the linen one . 
 They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks . 
 No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Of course . 
 Some are genuine . But all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced . 
 Yes . Fill it up , please . 
 Regular , please .

 You are so lucky . They are on sale today . It costs only 250 yuan . Pay at the counter over there . 

I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . 
 The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . 
 It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . 

Do you mind if I open the window ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ? 
 OK . 
 No , not yet . I just want a haircut . 
 I want it short . 
 I mean very short , shorter than it is now . 
 No , You can cut quite a bit off . I like it to be very short all over . Do you see what I mean ? 
 Yes , in the Chinese style . 
 No , thank you . 
 No , nothing of the kind . 
 That's very good ! 
 I'll have to check . Do you need anything else ? 
 That'll be 14 dollars in all . 
 Oh , but I Just want to pick up a package . It won't take long . 
 Can I park here just for a second ? 

It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you had to wait . Saturday is a busy day for us . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 
 Yes , sir . How about the sideburns ? 
 Can I use the clippers ? 
 Oh , all right , sir . 
 Don't you think it needs a little taken off on top , too ? 
 ( Raising a lock ) About like this ? 
 Shave also , s ir ? 
 How do you want your moustache trimmed ? 
 Here you are . Seventy-five cents , please . 
 Is there anything valuable in it ? 
 Shall I make out a receipt ? 
 That will be ninety-five cents in all . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colors do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is natural beige . How much do you sell it for ? 
 That's expensive . 
 I understand . I need a lipstick , too . Do you have lipsticks in red ? 
 All right . How much is it ? 
 Well , I'll take them . 
 I'm just comparing prices . 
 But they don't let you have goods on approval . 
 I found it a garage sale once . 
 Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . 

I'd like to send this to Chicago . 
 Air mail , please . 
 Make it special delivery , please . 

Would you tell me how I should send this parcel to Shanghai , China ? It contains only books . 
 I wonder if I could have it insured here ? 
 Let me see ... I think I can have them insured for five hundred dollars . 
 Here's a check for ten dollars . 
 Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... 
 Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time . 
 So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . 
 What's the difference ? 
 You must have bought many things in the mall ? 
 It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . 
 You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . 
 Yes , it is almost new here . 
 It is a color TV . You know , the rich people like the digital one now . So they have no room for them . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 We've got a bad line . Can you repeat that please ? 
 Sorry , the connection is terrible . I'll call you back because I can't hear anything . 
 I think it's my ankle . 
 One of my snowshoes got caught on a rock . 
 I don't think so.It ' s kind of sore . 
 Is that really necessary ? 
 About the same . 
 Should we be here , Alice ? I don't think it's that serious . 
 I hope not.It isn't that busy . 
 You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . 
 A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " 

Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . 
 Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . 
 No wonder people say , Even the immortals would rather be Guiliners . 
 I didn't know you liked bird watching . 

Where are you going to play this weekend ? 
 I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ? 
 Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? 
 No problem . The temple is quite large . 
 I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? 
 Anything else I should bring ? 
 Needless to say . 
 Do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ? 
 Anything of value in it ? 
 In that case , you'd better have it registered . 
 Yes , when your friend gets it , he'll sign a receipt , which will be sent to you by mail . Then you can be sure it's been received . 

I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? 
 Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? 
 Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . 
 Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now . But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colours do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is rose . How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . 
 Wow ! That's expensive . 
 I understand . 
 Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you 
 How did you spend the night there ? 
 I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . 
 Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . 
 I'd love to . 
 Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow . 
 Well , brown . 
 But they're purple . I prefer a brown set . 
 Well , I'm not so sure . Most of my make-up is brown . 
 Can I try it ? 
 No . 
 Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it . 
 You're right . I'll take them all . 
 We shouldn't have any trouble if the traffic isn't too heavy . Is this your first trip here ? 
 You haven't seen the sights yet , have you ? 
 Why don't you visit the Great Wall first ? 
 Here we are . That will be seven yuan and seventy cents . 

Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras . 
 It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to . It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone ! 
 I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . I can even surf the net . 
 Yes . With the 60 - second digital memory , I can record my voice and send it using voice message mode . 
 You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . 
 Nah ! It was cheap ! 
 Tian'anmen Square . 
 How long will it take ? We are in a great hurry . 
 Hope there is no traffic jam . 
 Could you drop us off on that corner ? 
 How much do we owe you ? 
 Here is ten yuan . Keep the change , please . 
 Thanks and you too . 
 Never . But I have been looking forward to it for quite a long time . 
 It's 2065 meters . Come on . Let us keep up the pace . 
 It's about 3 kilometers . 
 Why not walk further to the tree over there ? 

Waiter ! 
 This is not what I asked for . I'm afraid . 
 Yes . What I ordered is roast beef , not roast beef sandwiches . 
 I don't know anything about American food . What do you recommend ? 
 I'd rather have meat . 
 OK . Whatever you say . 
 Alright , Ma'am . What items would you like to order today ? 
 You may tell me both , Ma'am . 
 The Merriman satin sheets ? 
 And what size would you like ? 
 Alright , Ma'am . And what color did you want ? 
 So that is product number MS2119 , Size 
 Certainly . 
 Satin is like silk , Ma'am . It feels like silk . But it's a different material . 
 Anything else today ?

 Visa , Master Card , or American Express ? 
 Card number ? 
 Expiration date ? 
 All right , Ma'am . I will run that charge for you . And then I will get your address in a moment

 Good morning . 
 Yes . I'd like your breakfast special , please . 
 Soft-boiled , please . 

Why should I buy this MD player ? 
 What else ? 
 But how's the sound quality ? 
 Is that it ? 

What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , cakes and refreshments , and everything . 
 Any cereal , sir ? 
 And eggs ? 
 How do you want your eggs ? 
 Anything more , sir ? 

I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? 
 Is it so simple ? 
 It's true . 
 That's all ? 

Do you have a reservation , sir ? 
 I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ? 
 Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ? 
 We'll try to arrange it but I can't guarantee , sir . 

Would you like anything else , sir ? 
 Certainly . Would you like your coffee with your dinner or later ? 
 Of course . 
 I'd like to see the menu , please . 
 Don't you have any Chinese food ? 

Carlo's Kitchen . 
 For four , And may I have your name ? 

Hi , can I help you ? 
 What about this one ? 
 Oh , you want a convertible sofa . This way , please . Over there is the one you want . 
 We'd like to buy some furniture for our new house . 
 We like a larger wardrobe . 
 It's on the 7th floor . As you get off the elevator , you'll see it on your left . 
 Sure . Go straight ahead and you'll walk into it . 
 You're welcome . 
 We only have spring rolls today for take-out .

 Not long . They'll be ready in a few minutes . 
 Let me check ... what's your voucher number ? 
 Wait a minute , please---Mr . Wong , I'm terribly sorry . Our delivery truck had an accident today . I'm afraid your sofa won't be delivered until tomorrow . 
 Well , let me see . What price range do you have in mind ? 
 How about this one ? This is just $ 20 . It's worth every penny of it . 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , let's see what's wrong . 
 You have good taste . It's made of red wood . 
 300 dollars . 
 Believe me , it's worth the price . 
 How much are you willing to pay ? 
 No . That price would hardly cover the cost . 
 275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer . 

May I help you ? 
 I hope you will ! Take your time . We have a lot more upstairs . 

I'm going to Bihai Park.Is this the right bus , please ? 
 How can I get it , please ? 
 Could I have a transfer please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole . 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , it doesn't . There's no through bus to the National History Museum , madam .

 Is this the right bus to Zizhuyuan Park ?

 It's not that far . Do you see that Yellow building over there ? 
 The big one . 
 It's right next to it , on the right .

 Well , you could go down to 22nd street . There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day .

 A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great . 
 I feel like having a Coke . 

What can I do for you , sir ? 
 What kind of games do you like ? 
 I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? 
 Basically , there are 7 types of games 
 Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . 
 If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . 
 Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . 

Excuse me , where are the canned goods ? 
 Thank you.And where can I buy some delicatessen ? 
 Thanks a lot .

 Me too . Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat ? 
 Kentucky's ? Is that a chain restaurant ? 
 I've heard about it , but never had one . 
 OK . Let's go . 
 Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . 
 It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters . 
 It cost about thirty . Most games cost about that much . 
 Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game . 
 Yeah , my roommate likes to watch me play . He says it's like watching a movie . 
 And I've never heard such good sound in a game . 
 I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn . 
 I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . 
 Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . 
 Thank you .

 Great . They've all got built-in TVs .

 Pork . Where's the meat counter ? 

Hello , sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Would you like your hair washed as well ? 
 Okay , have a seat over here . How do you want it cut ? 
 All right . 
 With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? 
 Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? 
 Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . 
 A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . 
 Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . 
 Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . 
 Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . 
 Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . 
 Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . 
 How many do you want to buy ? 
 You're right . 
 Thank you . I try to keep in shape . 
 Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . 
 I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . 
 I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? 

Welcome to Flash Foot , sir . How can I help you ? 
 Do you have your negatives ? 
 What size do you want the prints ? 
 Okay , they'll be ready for you in an hour . 
 I'd like to have this roll of film developed . 
 Four by six will do . 

What is my ideal weight ? 
 How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ? 
 Sir , tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up . 
 Tell us how . 
 And now ? 
 Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 No , thank you . I don't need any skirts . 
 No , thank you . 
 No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know . 

Have you any beef today ? 
 How much is it a pound ? 
 Good . I'll get three pounds of it . 

Have you got some nice apples in stock today ? 
 Are they sweet ? 
 How much are they ? 
 All right , I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones . 
 Do you have any tangerines ? I'd like to have two kilograms . 
 How much is it in all ? 

What is your policy on returns ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Charge . Here's my card . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit . 
 I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . 
 Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you . 
 110 pounds . 
 No , you know I can't bear eating less . 
 I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . 
 You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . 
 I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you . 

Good morning . Welcome to Time After Time Watches . 
 Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ? 
 Hmm ... This Rolex ? $ 1,000 . 
 This one is $ 500 . 

The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ? 
 We take Visa and Master Card . 
 No , we don't . 
 Thank you ... please sign on the line . 
 Fill it up . Super Unleaded . 
 I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . 
 I'll charge it . Here's my card . 
 Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? 
 Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? 
 I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? 
 Here you are . 

May I help you ? 
 2.50 Yuan . 
 3.00 Yuan . 
 Here is your change , please . 
 Welcome to my shop next time . 
 Here is my card . Can I have them delivered to this address ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 OK , what would you like ? 
 Sure and which one would you like ? 

The skirt looks beautiful . Can I try it on ? 
 Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ? 

Is this a duty-free shop ? 
 I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ? 
 Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them . 

Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . 
 What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? 
 And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . 
 Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport 
 I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . 
 I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? 
 I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . 
 This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ? 
 Give me a shot of whisky and soda . 
 Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste . 
 Whoa , when . 

She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . 
 And bugs . They can catch anything . 
 No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . 
 It's better than picking up dog poop . 
 Yes . I'm going to stay with the same , a beer . 
 Oh , darn . Look what I've done . ( Spill the drink ) 

I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet . 
 You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat . 
 You said it . 
 No , thanks . I ’ m just looking around . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . 
 You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . 

Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? 
 Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . 
 Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . 
 To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . 
 Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . 
 No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . 
 Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . 
 Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . 
 Sure . It's down this street on the left . 
 No , it's not far . 
 About a mile and a half . 
 5 minutes or so . 
 Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there . 

Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ? 
 How long is the ride ? 
 Thank you.How much is the fare ? 
 Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I am a stranger here . 

Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the Today Mall ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . 
 An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . 
 I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . 
 I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . 
 So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? 

Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ? 
 That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight . 

Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ? 

How may I help you , miss ? 
 Would you like to have a perm ? 
 Oh , absolutely . 

Would you do me a favor ? 

Hello . My name ’ s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? 
 Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have . 
 What price range are you interested in ? 
 Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? 
 When would you like to move in ? 
 How about the end of this month ? 
 Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? 
 Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . 
 Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . 

Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? 
 Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? 

Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? 
 Do you charge for delivery ? 
 Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? 
 OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? 
 Thanks . 
 Hi , good evening . Which kind of beer would you like ? 
 How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here . 

Good evening , sir . 
 Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? 

Hello , ma'am . Can I help you ? 
 Sure , ma'am . Here you are . 
 25 yuan . 
 Thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in China . 
 Boy , you are lost . It's across town . 
 You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . 
 My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 I said , " Do you want me to help you ? " 
 OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ? 
 Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . 
 So , what do we do now ? 
 Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . 
 Can I pay you by check ? 
 Is there a laundry room in the basement ? 
 Can I sign the lease right now ? 
 I am wondering if you do facial care ? 
 How much would it be ? 
 I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? 

I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . 
 I'm trying to find a post office . 
 Should I take the bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ’ t you ? 
 That's the reason why you fought ? 
 You two are always quarrelling over little things . 
 Are you still mad at her now ? 
 Will you apologize to her ? 

Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me . 
 It does ’ t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired . 
 You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . 
 Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? 
 I like this one . How much is the rent ? 
 Does the rent include utilities ? 
 Where ’ s the laundry room ? 
 What ’ s your rule about pets ? 
 How come ? 
 who takes care of bug control ? 
 Thank you very much for taking your time . I ’ m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow . 
 Okay . 
 Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one . 
 Sure ! 
 Okay . Thank you for your reminder . 
 Thank you again . 
 John , I'm hard up at the moment . Could you lend me five hundred yuan ? I'll return it to you early next month . 
 Yes . Thank you so much . 
 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . 

Hello , Steven . Can you do me a favor ? 
 My car has broken down . 
 I have done it . But now I have an urgent appointment to keep . Could you drive me to the subway station ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know . 

Hello . May I speak to David ? 
 David Bush . 
 Sorry , I dialed the wrong number . 
 Hello ? Mr . Bernie . My name is Lisa . I hope I ’ m not disturbing you . I just heard about your daughter . I wanted to call you and tell you how much we ’ ll miss her . 
 What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . 

Can I help you ? 
 Yes , it ’ s this summer ’ s best-seller . 
 We provide free delivery and installation . 
 It is two-year and covers parts and service . 

Hello ? Hello ? 
 Hello ? Who is calling , please ? 
 Listen , I know who you are . If you call this number again , I ’ ll call the police . You ’ ll be arrested . I ’ Ve got your number . 
 I feel like a cup of black tea . 
 Yes , I'd like a portion of that strawberry tart . 

Here we come . 
 $ 10 . 
 Well , the rate is two dollars for the first two kilometers and twenty cents for each additional two hundred meters . 

Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend . 
 My advice would be to finish it at once . 
 Hello , madam . Where to ? 
 No problem.Get in now . 
 All right.Got it . 
 You can find one at the end of the street . 
 No.but there are quite many cars . 

Driver , bring me to the station . 
 Can you please speed up ? I am catching the train . 
 Oh , my god . 
 I'll see what I have got . What's it for ? 
 I can let you have some silvers if that is good . 

I am past my stop . Would you please let me get off ? 
 Well , that's OK . 
 OK . 
 Yes , I spent so much time sightseeing here . It is already so late now . I am afraid I can't catch the last bus back to downtown . 
 I am very grateful to your help . 
 Thanks again . 
 Good afternoon . I need some stamps and envelopes . 
 A dozen 30 - cent stamps and 6 envelopes . 
 That ’ s all . How much altogether ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Hello , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What size are you looking for ? 
 How about this one ? 
 What color do you like ? 
 How about that one ? 
 Sure . There is a changing room behind you . 

Excuse me . 
 Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 50 dollars . That's too much . 
 I don't like that one . 
 That's nice . How much is it ? 
 That'll be fine . 
 That blue one's fine . 
 Yes . 
 I'll take two more , a red one and a white one . 
 Yes . How would you like it ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 It's OK . 
 No , it's at counter 1 , right over there . 
 Yes . 
 Do you want to send it by air or by regular mail ? 
 I ’ ll have to weigh it first . 120 yuan , please . 
 Your change , please . 

Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 Of course . How about these postcards ? They are specially designed for Christmas . 
 No problem . You can choose what you like . 
 A postcard costs you five yuan . A dozen postcards cost you 60 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 
 Good morning . I want to post this letter . Can you tell me what the postage is ? 
 I want this letter registered . There is something valuable inside . 
 I think so . Would you mind telling me the postage now ? 
 Here is ten dollars . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 

Can I help you ? 
 There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters . 
 Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have . 

Good morning , Madam , can I take your order now ? 
 Anything else ? 
 How about drink ? 
 Please wait a moment . 
 OK . What's up , Madam ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , anything wrong ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 There's a question I want to ask you . 
 Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? 
 Why do you say so many thanks ? 

Do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? 
 I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? 
 I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! 
 I recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? 
 I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! 
 first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . 
 Yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . 
 That needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . 
 I'll prepare that . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 

Hi Michael . 
 I'm looking for the airport . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
 I think I can take the subway to the airport . Do you know where the subway is ? 
 Where ? I don't see it . 
 Oh , I see it now . Thanks . 
 Do you know if there's a restroom around here ? 
 Thank you . 

Chris , where are you going ? 
 Really ? I need to go to the store too . 
 Yeah , let's go together . 
 Now . 
 Now would be better . 
 Should we walk ? 

Excuse me , but could you give me some change ? 
 I want to make a long distance phone call . 

Excuse me , could you give me change for a dollar ? 
 I want to get cigarettes . 

I beg your pardon ? 
 That's very nice of you . I guess I could use some help . 

Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ? 
 I need it for the parking meter . 

Laura , what are you going to do today ? 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store ? 
 Do you have enough money ? 
 How much do you have ? 
 That's not very much . 
 Let me give you another ten dollars . 
 Bye . 
 Let me look . What do you need ? 
 I think dimes and quarters will do . 
 I want to send this letter to the US by airmail . 

I'd like to buy some postcards of Beijing . 
 Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it . 
 Good morning , I'd like a haircut . 
 Just a trim will do . 
 Here is the notice . 
 Sure , here you are . 

How can I help you ? 
 What's your name ? 
 Ok . Which facial would you like ? We have five different kinds of facials . 
 Well , since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun , I'd recommend our summer special . It's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin . 
 The facial will start with a thorough cleansing . 
 Yes . The stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . You can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well . 
 Yes . We'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun . 
 Ok , just follow me . 
 I said , " Is there anything I can do ? " 
 It's no trouble at all . I'll carry this suitcase for you . 
 Yes . 
 Nothing . The landlord pays . 
 Yes . Each apartment has one . 
 Yes . But you need to pay $ 60 for it each month . 
 Yes . We set up the new alarm system a few months ago . 
 Of course we do . It is the landlord ’ s responsibility . 
 Yes . 
 Hi , I ’ m Henry Wilson from number 37 . 
 Yes . Everything is fine in the apartment . But I know nothing about this area . Could I ask you some questions ? 
 Can you tell me the postal code for this building ? 
 Thank you . Also , how can I get my mailbox key ? 
 Who ’ s Peter ? 
 Thanks a lot . I ’ Ve got one more question . 
 Where can I change the address on my driver ’ s license ? 
 Can you give me directions to the office ? 
 Yes . 
 What floor is the office on ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room . 
 This is the kitchen . 
 Yes . We just renovated a few month ago . 
 Here ’ s the master bedroom . 
 $ 900 a month . 
 Yes . It includes electricity , water , gas and cable , but the telephone is extra . 
 The end of this month . 
 Sure . 

I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . 
 You see , there is a run at the neck . 
 No , thank you . 
 So do I ! 
 No , it's too expensive for me . I've decided to take some exercises on my own . 
 Run around the track . In the morning I run for an hour , and in the afternoon I run around the building . 
 I hope so . Would you like to join me ? 

You are in the pink recently . How do you make it ? 
 Are you tired after class ? 

What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 It won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 

Hi , I ’ m Ray , your tenant in Room 209 . 
 There ’ re some problems in my apartment . First , the faucet in the bathtub drips constantly . 
 One of the burners on the stove doesn ’ t work . 
 I can ’ t control the temperature . 
 Well , there ’ s one more thing . The telephone is dead . 
 Okay . Thank you very much . 

( At the MET station ) Hurry up ! We are running late for school . 
 Which line should we take if we go to Danshui ? 
 How much money should I insert in the slot ? 
 I see . 
 It's a priority seat . We can not sit there . We should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people . 
 If we go to Danshui in the morning on A weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour . 

Are you ready for your first driving lesson ? 
 The pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . 
 Automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . 
 Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 
 How ’ s that ? 
 Check your petrol situation . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 
 Remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! 

Hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . 
 That's right . I thought I'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs . 
 Well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . 
 Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . 
 How much do they cost ? 
 Yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . 
 I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . 
 Yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . 
 They look delicious . I think she'll be pleased . 
 Yes . I ’ m looking for something to wear to a formal party . 
 Medium , a woman ’ s size 10 or 12 . 
 Yes . 
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on . 
 It feels very good . 
 Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much . 

Hello , Frank . 
 Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment . 
 I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . 
 No . He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room . 
 Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him . 

So , how should we get to the theatre ? 
 I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . 
 It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . 
 Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . 
 We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . 
 Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
 Thanks , that was nice of you . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We open at lo 

How does it fit ? 
 The price is on the tag . How would you like to pay ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 Here's your receipt . Thank you for shopping here and have a nice day . 

Have you been served , sir ? 
 It's on the fourth floor . 

Good afternoon , anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , we have some nice sugar . 
 Sure , follow me . 
 I'm not surprised . You eat too much . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on a diet ? 
 Perhaps you should exercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class ? 

Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ? 
 Do you know the address ? 
 Can you write it down for me please ? 
 Is it faster if I take Highland avenue ? 
 I think you're right . Thank you . 
 OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Is that all ? 
 It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram . 
 Please go over there to weigh them . 

What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Do you want to have a tub bath , surfing bath or shower ? 
 All right . The fitting room is over there . 
 $ 100 . But we will charge you $ 200 as a deposit . 
 Of course . What kind of postal savings account do you want to open ? 
 OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates . 
 That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year . 
 Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second . 

Can I help you ? 
 Sure . When do you want to get it back ? 
 Yes , but we charge 50 % more and it only takes 3 hours . 
 30 yuan . 
 Oh , that's all right . 
 No . Forget about it . It's not important . 
 Yes . There is something wrong with my watch . It stopped several hours ago . 
 How much is a battery ? 
 How long will it last ? 
 Here is the money . 
 Yes , thank you . I want to get a handbag . 
 No , I have no girlfriend . 
 I am afraid it is too big . 
 Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ? 
 I hope so . Thanks . 
 I ’ m looking for a sweater . 
 Well , I ’ m looking for size 10 but you don ’ t have it . 
 Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ? 
 It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ? 
 Oh , it ’ s my favorite . How much is it ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much for your help . 

Excuse me . Where are the rice and flour ? 
 Thank you . 
 Tell me what seems to be the problem . 
 Did you ever talk to him about it ? 
 Yes , I am looking for a suit . 
 Can I have a black one over there ? 
 87 cents . 
 It ’ s on sale this week . 
 Here ’ s your change . 

Excuse me . 
 Are these drinks on sale this weekend ? 
 Can I buy more than one case ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take four , please . You saved me a lot . 
 Thanks . 

Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ? 
 So , I can have five for five dollars ? 
 Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please . 

Honey , I think you should quit smoking . 
 But I want you to be fit . 
 Check out this article . It says smoking can lead to lung cancer . 
 But you know that smoking does harm to health , right ? 
 Stop beating around the bush . Will you quit or not ? 

Have you been taken care of ? 
 Is there any special brand you'd like ? 
 The franchised store is on the second floor . 

Excuse me . Are these chips on sale ? 
 Is there any limit ? 
 That ’ s good . Thanks . 

I'm so hungry ! I haven't late eaten all day ! 
 They're all so thin ! Her cheekbones are great . 
 The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . If only we could be that thin then ... 
 Oh , bathroom blues . 
 I went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small . 
 ( Weigh herself ) Hey , I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . If I keep going , I can wear that dress next month . 
 Dieting . It's the price we pay to make men notice us . 
 They're also way younger than us . 
 You never worked out ? 

My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape . 
 Let me know how it works . 
 I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What about this one ? It sells like hot cakes . 
 Yes , I will get you one . 
 Yes , where can I buy trousers ? 
 What mark is it ? 

Have you any round-neck sweater ? 
 Can I try this one on ? 
 The color is too bright.For my age , I would prefer a lighter color . 
 You'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach . 
 You want to be beautiful , don't you ? Think about the butter and flour in ... 
 Most models only eat once a day . If they can do it , so can we . 
 I think you're hallucinating ! What are you talking about ? 
 And your point is ? 
 I agree with you , but I think people are pretty bad , too . 
 People are always gossiping about one another . 
 We can be so critical of one another . 

May I help you ? 
 This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton . 

Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? 
 I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . 
 Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . 
 OK , what style do you want ? 
 What about this one ? It fits you . 

We have a variety of trousers . Which one do you like best ? 
 What about this one ? 

Have you a garment ? 
 Show me the black one , my size . 
 Well , I don't think it matches my jeans.Can you give me some advice ? 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers . 

Can I help you ? 
 What about the red one ? It's the best seller . 
 Yes , We have . 
 I think the style is a little old-fashioned . It's not what I want . 
 Oh , yes . That's just the one I want . I will take it . 
 How is this one ? It's the latest , made of cashmere . 
 Sure . 

We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters . 
 absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas . 
 No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. 
 Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want . Can you see the sign on top of every shelf . It clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf . 
 I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number . 

What can I do for you ? 
 What about jeans ? It's the fashion now . 
 Then , how about this ? 

Did you smell something ? It smells so great . 
 How come I never knew that ? Do they have a new baker or something ? 
 Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now . 
 You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter . 
 It's one of my favorite bakeries . 

Can your dog do any tricks ? 
 I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . 
 So who takes care of him then ? 
 I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . 

Your dog is really cute . What's his name ? 
 What kind of dog is he ? 
 Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? 
 That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . 
 About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . 
 She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . 

Excuse me . Check please . 
 Very nice . Thank you . 
 Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ? 
 Do you take credit cards ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 

Michelle , Can you help me clean things up before we go ? 
 Which cup ? 
 Put it on the table . 
 Oh , that goes in the refrigerator . 
 Bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom . 
 Give it to me . I need to use it . 
 You can throw that away . I don't need it anymore . 
 Alright , then please put it in a bag and take it outside . 
 I think we're finished . Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ? 

I want to buy a shirt . 
 A white one , please . 
 What's the size ? 
 I think a medium one will do . 
 OK . What do you think of it ? 
 I think so . But can I try another one ? I don't like the color . 
 Sure . The color is perfect for you . 
 It's made of cotton . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 This one is the latest . How do you like it ? 
 Sure . 

Have you been taken of , miss ? 
 We have quite a variety of shirts here . 
 Silk . You have a good taste . It's excellent for its handiness , elegance and beauty . 

Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? 
 Really ? Does he chase balls ? 
 This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . 
 He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . 
 The one on the manikin is in fashion now . 
 OK , here you are . You look really attractive in that gown . 

May I be of any help ? 
 What style ? 
 Ok . Here are the ones , turtleneck pullover , crewneck pullover , V-neck pullover and cowl-neck pullover . 
 I am going to the Capital Hotel . 
 About how much it will cost ? 
 On the meter ? 
 OK.let ' s go . 
 I want a chemise . 
 Could I try it on ? 
 Well . It's not my taste . Would you please bring me a short sleeve ? 
 Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time . We should be able to down it before they close . 
 It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? 
 You're back already . That sure was quick . 
 Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer.Anyway.He said it was too close to closing time . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 What's the fare ? 
 The fare is different from the meter . 
 But I thought it was . Anyway . I am in a hurry . Here is the money . 
 Well , it's not the supermarket you want . 
 OK . 

Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days . 
 That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time . 
 I see . How much do I need to pay in total for this package ? 
 Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong . 
 Do I need to include my zip code in the address ? 
 Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars . 

Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars ! 
 Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ? 
 Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . 
 I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . 
 Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . 
 Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . 
 Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . 
 That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . 
 They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? 
 I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . 
 It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . 

Do you have sport shirts for ladies ? 
 I think the red one fits me well . Can I try it on ? 
 Where is the fitting room ? 

The dress looks beautiful . Can I touch it ? 
 I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on . 

Are you looking for shoes ? 
 What about this brown one ? 

Can I try this dress on ? 
 Well , I like the styte , but I don't think the color fits me . Could you bring me a green one ? 

Could you give me some advice ? 
 It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better . 

Oh , my god . I am so heavy now . I gain 10 kilos . 
 I think I should go . I really need to lose some weight . 
 0K.See you then . 
 Nope , I do not have a membership yet . 
 That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club . 
 No problem . What are you looking for ? 
 Yes , your laptop is on the chair . 
 Which one ? 
 It's under the table . 
 There's a pencil in front of the lamp . 
 Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup . 
 It's in between the wall and the bed . 
 They're on the left side of the TV . 
 Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . 
 Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone . 
 OK . 
 Leopard . It's famous brand of good quality . 

I want to buy a black suit . 
 I prefer single breasted suit . 
 That looks great . Do you have ties here ? 
 I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy . 
 I don't like to keep up with joneses . 
 I think this suits me . Can I try it on ? 
 Let me see . Yes , here you are . 
 No , they won't . They are shrink proof . 

Do you get up early every morning ? 
 Good habit . How long does it take ? 
 No , my little sister lives with me . 
 About 12 . She is a good girl . 

OK , Lucy.It ' s your turn.Are you ready ? 
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! 
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him . 

Who wants to go first ? Lily ? 
 OK.Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! 
 I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? 
 I know it is quite different from Western chess . 
 But isn't it the same with wiki ? 

May I take a look at the shoes over there ? 
 Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ? 
 It's comfortable . I will take it . 
 Well , I think the color is a little too bright . 
 Yes . What's this made of and how to wash it ? 

Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! 
 He sounds like a sick cow ! 
 I already tried that . Nothing seems to help . 
 Coing out for a walk . 
 OK . I am hungry , too . I like their milkshake . They're very creamy and tasty . 
 Yup . But , this also means we have to wait to order our food . 
 Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious . 
 OK , I think I know what to order for my lunch now . But , eating too much fried food really makes me fat . 
 That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! 
 Ok ! 
 Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times . 
 But I called your cell phone , and there was no answer . 
 Do you feel better now ? 

I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? 
 I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . 
 Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . 
 There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . 
 Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . 
 Sorry , turkey . I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight , remember ? And I'm watching ' Disco Fever ' on channel 6 . 
 Hey , what's wrong with the TV ? 
 Looks like the TV wins that argument . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 Yes.We have in stock a variety of styles and they are in different colors.What do you think of this one ? 
 It's made in China . The quality is excellent . 

Can I help you in any way ? 
 How do you like this pattern ? The pink suits you well . 
 It's of good quality . 
 Yes . Which one is the latest ? 
 It's my style . Will it be resistance to balling ? 

May I help you ? 
 Do you have any style in your mind ? 
 I recommend you this one . It's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing . 

I think this suit displays your nice finger . 
 No problem . 
 Of course not , it is made of pure silk . 
 Just a few minutes . I need to make a list of the things that we need . 
 I forgot about the potatoes . Oh , I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . What kind of tea do you prefer ? Green tea or flower tea ? 
 We don ’ t have enough cash , but I ’ ll take my credit card . 
 Who ’ s calling , please ? 
 Hold on a second , please . 
 I had planned to . I can bring some from my place . And there's some more at my parents ' . 
 Of course , I have . There is one in my old house . And I have another one from college at my parents ' house . 
 Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to . 
 Sure , but I don't have hot water , yet . 
 No , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . My phone should be working then , too . 
 Yeah , I can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . Let's go to the restaurant nearby . It's my treat . 

Hello . I am Bili and I made an appointment with you to see the house . 
 The house is a little too old . 
 Yes . That's why I like the house . 
 Hello . Is that Nicholas ? 
 Never ! Do you know his new number ? 
 Yes , I do . Go on . 
 4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help . 
 No , I cann't . I'm in a hurry ! 
 Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . 

Good afternoon . 
 Thank you . 
 It ’ s half past twelve . 
 From one to two . 
 We usually go to the cafeteria . 
 let ’ s go together . 
 Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . 
 To begin with , I have to use chopsticks . 
 Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table . 
 Anything strange about that ? 
 Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 

I like to drive on freeway . 
 Don't worry.There ' re few cars now . 

There's going to be a highway here . 
 The traffic problem will soon be eased . 

How do you spend your day , Helen ? 
 Really ? What time do you go to work ? 
 And when do you get home at night ? 
 So what do you do , exactly ? 
 Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV . 
 These red ones ? I'm not sure . 
 Oh , these ? Hmm ... Yellow isn't a good color for me . 
 Which one ? 
 It's $ 42 ! ! That's expensive ! 

Hello . 9-1- 1 . Can I help you ? 
 What happened ? 
 Give me your address . 
 All right . The police and an ambulance are on the way . In the meantime , find a clean cloth and press it firmly over the wound . This will slow the bleeding . 
 Help will be there in just a few minutes . 
 Tina , you should have more nutritious food . Don't eat these crisps any more . 
 Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? 
 How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ? 
 Oh , you've already grown up , son . 
 Are you having problems with it ? 
 Let me help you . 
 MI stands for Middle Initial . 
 That means Month / Day / Year . Use numbers . 
 For example , if your birth date is January 12 , 1987 , write 01/12 /8 7 . 
 Always print clearly , and fill in the bubbles completely . 
 What do you want to do ? 
 That will make him so happy . 
 One that won't grow up too big . 
 Do you know which one he would like ? 
 I bet you had to drag him away . 
 I wonder what he'll name it . 
 How much is the fare , please ? 
 Wait . I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village . 
 I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue . 
 But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park . 
 Would you tell me when we get there ? 

You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ? 
 You're kidding ! 
 Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? 
 Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! 
 How about the cinema ? 
 Oh I don't know . Titanic ? 

I'll be glad when winter comes . 
 Because I love the snow . 
 Last year we made a big snowman . 
 It was seven feet tall . 
 It took us all day . 
 Of course . We gave him a big carrot for a nose . 

I'm going to the bank . 
 I need to withdraw some money . 
 I'll just use the ATM . 
 It's the Automatic Teller Machine . 
 I just insert my debit card into the machine . 
 Well , it gives me money , but it's my own money . 

Operator . May I help you ? 
 Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want . 

I'll have a whole-wheat loaf , three white loaves , a baguette and ten rolls , please . How much is that ? 
 There you go . 

Hello ? 
 What are you doing in Australia ? 
 Oh , right . What time is it there ? 
 Yes - four o'clock in the morning . 
 That's OK . I'm awake now . 
 Channel Two . A TV series was showing on it . The name of the series is Huanzhu Gene 
 Generally it's to my appetite . What about you ? 
 Don't be too critical . So what's your favorite ? 

Hey ! Are you getting dressed ? 
 Why ? What time is it ? 
 But it's Saturday ! ! 
 No , I'm not . I'm staying in bed . 
 If I'm awake . 
 Sure . You mean this one ? 
 It ′ s a state-of-the-art piece of equipment , sir . With a gigantic 16.1 USGA TFT screen , 2.8 Ghz mobile processor , generous 512 MB RAM , removable 80 GB hard drive , convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive , stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM , dual battery capability , integrated Fast Ethernet card , IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports , it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook ! 
 The regular price is $ 2980.00 , but until December the 31st it ′ s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 . 
 Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt . 
 Not really . 
 I like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . Do you have that in other colours , too ? 
 Yes . I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one , too ? 

Good morning . Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Sure . Coming right up . 
 How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ? 
 Air mail , please . 
 Four stamps , please . How much is that ? 
 There you go . 
 I'm sorry , but I don't think so . 
 Well , there's a department store on Grant Street . There are restrooms in the basement . 
 Between Second and Third Streets . The store is across from the hotel . 
 You're welcome . 
 But , Mom , I'm not dirty . 
 Why ? 
 I don't smell bad . 
 If I smelled bad , I could smell me . 
 I can smell you , too . 
 When can I wear perfume ? 
 I had to blow my nose . 
 Did you hear that ? 
 It wasn't that loud . 
 Okay . I'll take your word for it . 
 You're funny . 
 I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy a new computer , but I don't really know much about them . Can you give me any suggestions ? 
 Laptops are more expensive , right ? 
 I'll just get a regular home computer then . I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me . 
 What did they say ? 
 That's too bad . How much is a new one ? 
 Plus installation ? 
 Really ? 
 That's nice . 
 If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . 
 You should unplug the phone . 
 Do you want me to wake you in an hour ? 
 I'll start dinner at 6:00 . 
 If not , your nose will wake you up . 
 You might even dream about dinner . 
 Have a nice nap . 
 Exactly what ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 What happened before ? 
 Oh , no . That's bad news . 
 Will you lose all your files ? 
 You're smart . 
 I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Mostly just to browse the Internet and send emails to friends . 

Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet . 
 This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular . 

I think I'll get some new goggles . 
 We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ? 
 I think I'll get a hat , too . 
 Okay , I guess that's it . Let's go pay for this stuff . 
 We usually eat chicken , pork and beef . You eat these meats a lot in your country too , don't you ? 
 I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops . 
 Yes , I have . I tried once when I visited your country last year . I think they were very tasty . Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . 
 Yeah , I think I'll get this one-piece . 
 I'm too fat for a bikini . 
 I'll wear that if you'll wear these Speedos . 

This is a good basic computer package . It's got a good CPU , 256 megabytes of RAM , and a DVD player . 
 Yes , it has a built-in modem . You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer . 
 A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . If you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money . 

Are you ready ? 
 Ready for the big switch . 
 The nation is switching to digital TV . 
 Did you buy the converter ? 
 How much was that ? 
 Does it pick up any digital channels ? 

You're in great shape , Keith . Do you work out at a gym ? 
 So , how often do you work out ? 
 Say , I like racquetball , too . 
 Uh ... how well do you play ? 
 Well , all right . But I'm not very good . 

Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . 
 But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . 

This is No . 1 bus , bound for Sihun . 
 There are another six stops . 
 Is it Wangfujing ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 Is this where I get off ? 

May I take your order ? 
 All right . And would you like a salad ? 
 OK . What kind of dressing would you like ? We have vinaigrette , Italian , and French . 
 And would you like anything to drink ? 

Could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ? 
 But he always wimps out of difficulty . 

Did you put the blue bin out on the street ? 
 Well , you'd better take it out front . 
 It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow . 
 Oh , no , you don't . 
 Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late . 
 You'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it . 

Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in . 
 I'm looking for a grocery store . Are there any around here ? 
 OK . And is there a laundromat near here ? 
 Thank you . 
 A barber shop ? ! 
 It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine . 
 About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me . 
 Is it all right to smoke on the bus ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 I only wish it were this time yesterday . 
 Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . 
 Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... 

Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! 
 Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . 
 Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? 
 How much did she ask for ? 
 She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? 
 Then you pretended to go without buying it ? 

I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . 
 but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 

Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 Yes , all of us have naps . 
 No , not at all . 
 I go to bed at ten and get up at six . 
 Sure . 
 In a second . Have you got a torch ? 
 Here it is . Let's go . 
 Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . 
 All right . 
 I finished them in no time . 
 Mum , when will we have them again ? 
 OK , Mum , when will you be back ? 

Why is the car before us stopping ? 
 Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . 
 Yes . This is what is called road rage . 
 Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday . 
 Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole . 
 Here it is . 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . 

Would you like a cigarette ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? 
 Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . 
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? 

What's your weight . 
 Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . 

your muscles are a spectacle ! 
 By the way , do you work out ? 
 Fine . 
 No.Why ? 
 Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day . 
 Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . 
 I think so , too . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me . 
 I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
 It was okay . 
 No thanks , I'm not thirsty . 
 Not really . 
 Yes I did . 
 Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual . 
 We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? 
 Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer . 
 I'll see you later then . 

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . 
 No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . 
 Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . 
 Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . 
 Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . 
 Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? 
 We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? 
 You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? 
 Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . 
 Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift . 
 Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! 
 Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . 
 What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . 

Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 
 You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . 
 You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . 
 Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . 

Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . 
 So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . 
 So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? 
 What does that imply , then ? 

I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . 
 How much are the roses ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I'll take a dozen . 
 No , the roses will be fine . 

Overseas operator , may I help you ? 
 Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? 
 Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through . 
 I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . 
 And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . 
 Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! 
 It seems like a traffic accident . 

It's raining heavily . 
 All right . 
 No , we can't . It's thundering . 

Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? 
 Cindy , you're so cute . 
 I have a little white cat . 
 Yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . 
 Not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
 Absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 
 Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
 Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 
 For example ? 
 Oh , that's interesting ! 
 Let's take a roundabout way . 
 Look , traffic jam again ! 
 Of course , there're too many people . 
 But we couldn't help it . 
 I've a driver mate in my car ! 
 Yes , it's so helpful . 
 Let's just park here . 
 Oh , the policeman's coming . 
 What happened ? 

John , it ’ s time to get up . 
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
 It ’ s nearly half past seven . 
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
 Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . 
 No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . 

This is the rush hour . 
 Let's drive off this road . 

How often does the bus run ? 
 Oh , here comes a bus ! 

Why do you stop me ? 
 I'm sorry . 
 I don't know . 

There're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day ! 
 Yeah , we should have more roads built . 
 The radio said it's OK on this road . 
 We have too many cars ! 
 Two hours.That area is a little backward . 
 You're right . 
 You really should go to Rachel's pet store . 
 It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
 Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . 
 Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 
 But it will pose a risk to your health . 
 I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . 
 I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . 
 Yes , good luck , Maria . 
 The People's Park is located on Nanjing Road , near Limbo road , just on the opposite side of the International Hotel . 
 Only about twenty minutes . 
 No , you aren't . Just go ahead , please . 
 You can take the No . 22 trolley bus to get there . 

What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking 
 It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! 
 Yeah . I go shopping once a week 
 What do you mean ? I can't understand . 
 Really ? That's unbelievable . 
 It's here at last ! 
 Twenty minutes exactly . 
 Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon . 
 That's no use.This is morning rush hour . 
 Pity we didn't catch it . 
 We have to wait six more minutes ! 
 Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted . 
 Not really . 
 It's great ! 
 high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 
 What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? 
 It's a bit small but looks nice . 

Hello , may I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . 
 That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . 
 And there's no one living over us . 
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 
 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , 
 Are the plumbing all right ? 
 The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water 
 The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again . 
 Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 
 Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . 
 Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places . 
 That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . 

I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . 
 Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . 

My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . 
 That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . 
 Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . 
 256MB . 

Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ? 

George , did you remember to buy me the book ? 
 When will you buy it then ? 

Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . 
 Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . 
 Like you and me ! 
 Sure , Mum.In a minute . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 What ? 
 Oh . Why did she do that ? 

Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 
 we've spent $ 1,000 . 

Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? 
 What do you think is the biggest change ? 
 That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . 
 I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . 
 How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? 
 I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? 

Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? 
 First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . 
 Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . 
 Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal . 
 That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . 
 Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . 

Hey , you look great ! how's everything ? 
 Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . 
 You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . 
 Sounds reasonable . 
 And fruits ! 
 I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
 I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . 

Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? 
 Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
 Really ? What's the series about ? 
 It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . 
 Really ? that's interesting ! 
 OK , I'll give it a go . 
 No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . 
 I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . 
 What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . 
 I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . 
 He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . 
 Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . 
 Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited . 
 And the host announced that he won it all ! 
 Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . 
 That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . 
 Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . 
 And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . 
 I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . 
 I bought it online . 
 Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . 
 Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 
 And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall . 
 Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . 
 Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . 

Hello . Do you know how I can find a room to rent ? 
 Will that work ? 
 Good idea . Thank you . 
 Yes . What is the rent ? 
 Then what's the rent due date ? 

Do you have any apartment to rent ? 
 Where is it . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 That's good . When can I go to see the house ? 
 Fine . 
 You're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . 
 You can take a No . 2 bus here . 
 At Longing Street . 
 Eight o'clock . It's time for you to get up and have breakfast . 
 You won't go to work today , Steven , It's Sunday . Come and have breakfast now . 
 You have been too tired recently , darling . That's why I didn't wake you up this morning . After breakfast , you can go to sleep again . 

Steven , it's ten o'clock . I'm going to bed . I'm beat . 
 Oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? It's already past 10 . 
 Okay . Please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . I don't want the dog down there tonight . 
 Good night . 
 Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday . 
 Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old . 
 Yes . And there's a walk-in closet . 
 Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。 
 It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease . 

What's the name of this street ? 
 Do you know of any banks near here ? 

Can you hold the end of this tape measure ? 
 I ' m taking some measurements for new curtains . 
 I thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls . 
 Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . 
 Great . Where is it ? 
 What about the surrounding area ? 
 That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? 
 Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . 
 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . 
 Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . 
 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . 
 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . 
 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . 
 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 Why ? 
 Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out . 
 That's $ 1 825 . 
 $ 3 075 . Our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 . 
 Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . 
 All right . 
 Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No . It's only a ten-minute walk . 
 You're welcome . 
 There is one next to the post office , round the corner . 

Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thank you . 
 Turn left at the second light . You can't miss it . 
 No . It's not far at all . 
 That's all right . Have a good day . 
 We ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? 
 Sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . 
 Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? 
 Ok . What do you think about our living room ? 
 My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . 
 Your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming . 
 That ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot . 
 Of course . Go straight ahead . Turn right at the next street . You'll see a tall , yellow building.The post office is on the first floor . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 No , It's only about five minutes ' walk . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Sorry , I'm not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh . I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion . There are so many other really important things in the world . 
 The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . 
 just walk down this road and you'll find it . it's on the right side . 
 Sure , turn left at the next crossing . 
 Yes . You can't miss it . 
 Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? 
 This dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . 
 That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 
 No , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . 
 If I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . 

This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ? 

Can I help you ? 

Hello , may I speak to Kevin , please ? 

Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate . 
 It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you . 

How much is this shirt , please ? 
 Do you have it in a larger size ? 

Your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair . 
 This is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . 
 Ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 
 That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 
 Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . 
 I don't think it's broken . 
 Fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . 
 Yes , this is the right bus . 
 Don't worry . I'll call out the stops . 
 No , don't worry . I'll get you off when you get there . 
 No , not that long . Two more stops , and you'll get off , sir . 
 Not at all . 
 Of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
 We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . 
 It can't be that bad . 
 Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . 
 Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? 
 Has anything else happened to you ? 
 Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 
 A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . 
 Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . 
 Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Steven , are you talking to me ? 
 I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . 
 A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . 
 I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . 
 I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . 
 No , this taxi is free . 
 OK . Please get in . I'm glad to serve you . 
 It will take half an hour to get to the hotel . 
 OK , I promise we'll get there in twenty minutes . 

It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . 
 I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . 
 Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . 
 Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . 
 I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . 
 Do you have any money ? 
 For our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . 
 I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! 

What time does the museum close ? Any idea ? 
 What time is it now ? 

What do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . 
 I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! 
 How about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you . 
 Here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . 
 Let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . 
 I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! 

Steven , you are always looking in good shape . How do you keep it ? 
 Yeah , you are right . Tell me your normal diet . 
 And ? 
 Oh , no wonder you are healthy . 
 Thanks for sharing your experience with me . 

How is your house hunting going ? 
 How much are you looking to spend ? 
 Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . 
 Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! 
 I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? 
 How long do you want to sign a contract for ? 
 Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? 
 You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? 
 It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . 
 Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . 

Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . 
 I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . 
 I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . 
 Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . 
 OK , I will do it right now . 
 All right , Steven . Do you have a flashlight ? 
 OK , now go down to the basement and find the circuit box . Open it and check if there are any fuses blown out . 
 You'll see it's black and has burnt smell . 
 Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones . You can find them on the rack in the basement . 

How do I get to the post office from school ? 
 OK , I see . Thank you very much . 

What's your apartment like ? 
 What is it like living in on-campus housing ? 
 Did you have to pay a deposit ? 
 Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? 
 How long is your contract for ? 
 Have you started looking yet ? 
 Good luck ! 
 We just moved in yesterday , actually . 
 It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . 
 It's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history ! 
 It's just off of the ring road . 
 It's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . 
 Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . 
 Right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend . 

Steven , what's the expense of moving house ? 
 It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? 
 We have to cut back on our shopping from now on . 
 I hope so . 
 Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful ! 
 Maybe you have a point . 
 All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! 
 Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . 
 Why not try it on ? 
 Yes . 

How far is it from here to the airport ? 
 I need to get there before ten.Can we make it ? 

Julia , I have good news for you . 
 I have earned a lot of money this week , more than I do in a fortnight . 
 My wages are six hundred dollars a week . But I find a part-time job to supplement my income . 
 I know , darling . I must earn enough money to buy a car . I do a part-time job to increase my income . Don't worry , I will take care of myself . 

Hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . 
 It's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ? 
 If you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . 
 Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . 
 How about at 6 pm ? 

Yes , sir . Where would you like to go ? 
 Is it the one on Xi Shut Street ? 

Excuse me , bags aren't permitted inside the supermarket . 
 Don ’ t worry . Just check in your bag before entering . 
 The checkroom is just behind the front door . 

Here we are . This is Wangfujing Street . 
 25 yuan , please . 
 Thank you . Here ’ s your change and receipt . 
 There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate . 
 I'd like to see some coats . Would you recommend me some of them ? 
 Which models do you sell the most ? 
 I like this style , but I don't like its color . Do you have this coat in yellow ? 
 It looks nice . 

Steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ? 
 But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ’ t mind , that's OK . 
 I see . We will go the day after tomorrow . 
 I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken . 
 Thank you , darling . 
 Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! 
 What would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? 
 Well , let's get a plate of those then . 
 I think I might have a dahl . 
 It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 
 Ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 
 I think I'll have a beer . 
 I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . 
 What would you do without me ? 
 You can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your package . 
 It takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . 
 Sure . How many would you like ? 
 Are you sending them abroad ? 
 Do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . 
 Ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . 
 That ’ s another quid . 

This shirt is really nice . 
 OK . I'll try on a medium size . 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 It's too big tor me . Do you have a smaller one ? 

How much is it ? 
 It s a little overpriced . Is there any discount on this laptop ? 
 I ’ d buy this if it were cheaper . How about 5 000 yuan ? 
 Is it the final price ? 
 Alright , I ’ ll buy this one . 
 Buy more and get more special discount coupons . 
 Of course You get a coupon for every 3 bags of sugar . 
 10 pence off if you use this coupon . 
 Yeah , you need to take advantage of it within its expiry date . 
 The coupon can be used at least one year . 
 All right . I will get them for you . 
 Okay . Come with me . 
 Sorry , you can only pay cash . 
 Here's your change . 
 Of course , I'll get right on it . 
 Hi . I ’ m interested in renting a one-bedroom apartment . 
 Thank you . 
 They're in aisle 2A , down that way . 
 Yes , they're in ... let me think ... Aisle 3B , if I remember right . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is . 
 Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there . 

Excuse me , I'm looking for your 3 - liter Pepsis , the ones that are on sale this week . There don't seem to be any in the soft drink section . 
 Yes , I would , thank you . 

Can I help you ? 
 What size are you ? 
 Ok , try these on in the changing rooms . 
 I'd like to buy a watch . 
 Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ? 
 Oh . I don't think I can afford that . How about this one ? 
 Wow . That's too much for me . Don't you have anything cheaper ? 
 Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? 
 Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? 
 I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? 
 Here you are . 

Good morning . sir . How may I serve you today ? 
 Sure . Large or medium ? 
 Anything else to go ? 
 You've got it . 
 Sure . It's seven eighty-nine . 
 Thank you , sir . Have a nice day . 
 OK . How much is the fare ? 
 45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ? 
 Is there something wrong with your meter ? 
 OK . Could you give me a receipt ? 

This is my favourite restaurant . 
 Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before . 
 Oh yes . Like this , for example . Have you ever eaten jellyfish before ? 
 What about these ? Have you ever tried pig ’ s brains ? 

That was a really good meal , Gordon . 
 Well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . 
 Let's see how much the bill is . 
 What are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . 
 No way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . 
 That's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . 
 You've got a deal . 
 Bye . 
 Sorry . I didn't know . 
 I'm going to use my ATM card . 
 Done . 
 No , thanks . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Paper , please . 
 Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . 
 Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . 
 I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . 
 Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . 
 What are they ? 
 They're much better 
 That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . 
 I suppose so . 
 I don't think that will do . How about the one at your back ? 
 No , the other one ... yes . 
 It do look beautiful . Well . I think I'll take it.Now do you have any racket covers ? 
 How much does it come up to ? 
 Do you accept credit cards ? 

You like this china tea set , don't you ? 
 Sure.How about the brown one ? 
 The blue one ? 
 You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Centrum ? We have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets . Which kind do you want ? 
 And what kind of toothbrushes would you like ? 
 Sure . This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium . 
 This one is 5 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes . 
 I can recommend the spare ribs . They are very tasty here . 
 Ok why don ’ t you order the braised fish then ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll help you eat it . 
 Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ? 
 Ok then , let ’ s get the chicken feet . 
 I ’ d prefer wine . You ? 
 Ok , a bottle of the house red please ! 
 What's your favorite dish or dishes ? 
 But a Chinese person would never order that . 
 Alex , you don't know what to order . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant together next time . 
 Get ready for the best meal of your life ! 
 You ’ re welcome . Would you like some cold dishes ? 
 Ok , and anything to drink ? Maybe some jasmine tea ? 
 And for your main course ? I can recommend the sizzling beef . 
 Oh , that ’ s a good choice . Very healthy too . 
 Well first put your money in . 
 Then just press this button . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Well , why don ’ t you use a local SIM card ? 
 Yes . Just go to the convenience store and ask for a SIM card . Then insert it into your phone . 
 Well it ’ s 100 RIB for the SIM card then it will cost you about 10 RIB per minute to call the UK . 

It's especially cold when the wind is blowing . 
 What can wearing one do for me ? 
 So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket . 
 You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers . 
 Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver . 
 Yes , I ’ m off to the department store . I must buy some furniture for my new flat . 
 Ok . Thanks for that information . 
 Ok , do they have a delivery service ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll see you later . 
 Who do you know there ? 
 I see . 
 Yeah , but it isn't more expensive than international calls . 
 Easy . Dial the area code for Connecticut ; then dial your friend's number . 
 Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident . 
 Oh , yes . Mother's Day is coming . Do you plan to buy anything ? 
 Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream . 
 180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package . 
 Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag . 

Oh dear , I ’ m late . I have to be in the office by 8am . 
 Well there is an important meeting with a new client . 
 Oh , you don ’ t have to do that but it would be a great help . 

Can I take your order , sir ? 
 Certainly sir , would you like some rice or noodles with that ? 
 Ok , would you like some soup as well ? 
 Thank you very much . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . 
 The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . 
 Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . 
 Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? 
 You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . 
 I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . 
 You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . 
 Seriously ? 

What was that ? 
 How did it happen ? 
 It was my favorite . 
 Maybe I shouldn't have put it here . Someone was bound to bump it eventually . 

Hey , Mary . Dress warmly for today . 
 Looks can be deceiving . 
 It's very windy today . 
 Mary , you must be careful . In some parts of America , the day can be - 10 ° C and sunny . 
 Are you homesick ? 
 Don't worry about the bill . Just call . 
 Of course . First dial the code 011 to get an international line . Then you dial Taiwan's country code 
 Now you should know the rest . Don't forget to dial Taipei's city code . 
 I need a hat . Would you show me some ? 
 I like the black one . May I try it on ? 
 Yes , I thinks so . How much is it ? 
 Can you make it much cheaper ? 

Cool camera . What are its features ? 
 What about the quality of the pictures ? 
 Wow ! What about the memory ? 

Lisa , is there a milk section ? 
 What's Condiments ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Great ! Pasta for dinner . 
 Maybe we should get a shopping cart . 

Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras . 
 It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to.It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone ! 
 I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net . 
 Yes.With the 600 - second digital memory , l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode . 
 You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . 
 Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza . 
 Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ? 
 I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then ! 

Lisa , I need some help here . 
 Well , I need to get some female stuff . 
 Yeah . I didn't know what they're called in English . 
 I'll keep that in mind . 
 I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ? 
 No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry . 
 So , we'd like to see some embroidery . 
 I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift . 
 I saw a pair of earrings outside your window . Can you show them to me ? 
 Exactly . How much do you want for them ? 
 What is this setting made of ? 
 I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt . 

Can I help you , madam ? 
 I see . Do you have any ideas so far ? 
 Sure , madam . But may l know how old he is ? 
 And the height ? 
 I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers . 
 How about this one then ? 

That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ? 
 Could I try it on ? 
 It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? 
 OK . How much does it cost ? 

Good morning madam . What can I get you ? 
 Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ? 
 Well we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte or Americano . 
 Here you are . You ’ ll find the sugar just over there . 
 It means young girls . That's where you'll find clothes for young girls . 
 You're small , but you're not a child . 
 There's a petite section that you an check out . 
 It has clothes in small sizes for small women . 
 It is called Energy Collector . 
 Maybe . Oh . I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it.It was very exciting . 
 Me , too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? 
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . 
 So you can prove you are a man . 
 It's just you ! 
 Yes please . Do you have any teas ? 
 What do you recommend ? 
 What ’ s this one ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll try that . 
 Where ? 
 That'll be 64 cents . 
 Sure . The total comes to twelve dollars and eighty cents . 
 That depends on the weight . 

Excuse me , but do you have this T-shirt in size L ? 
 Too bad . I really like it . 
 Do you have it in size L ? 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 Thanks . 
 Oh , really ? 
 Well , it's a good thing for you . 
 So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? 
 junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat . 
 Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it . 
 Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit .

 The antiques market here in Paris is very famous . It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen . 
 It's also known as Les Puces , which means ‘ The Fleas ' . 
 Well , it really depends . Because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices . 
 Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ?

 No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream . 
 It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . 
 Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . 
 Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian .

 Two hamburgers and French fries .

Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
 I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . 
 We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . 
 Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't it ? 
 I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? 

I ’ ll take this blouse and skirt please . 
 Can I pay by card ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll pay by card then . 
 It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us . 
 But there's no hot water after 10 at night . Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . It feels good . 
 True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped . 
 You're right . The view is spectacular . But that bedroom is so small . We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . 
 I haven't thought of that . 
 Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . 
 It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable ! 
 Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . 
 Yes , and he also ... 
 Probably not . After all he is our teacher . We should try to find something nice to say . If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all . 
 All right . I want to take a shower first , I ’ m exhausted . 
 Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket . 
 I like this jacket . Can I try it on ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes of course . This is a really good one actually . 
 This one is 1500 yuan . 
 Would you like anything else ? 

Waitress ! My bill for today's lunch , please .

 That's all right . 

Believe it or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water . 
 Right . And China is the homeland of tea . 
 Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ? 
 Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ? 
 You surely know a lot about Chinese tea . 
 Oh , so do I . 
 Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there . 

It has a receiver , a CD player , a double cassette deck , and a turntable . 
 The CD player is a three-disk player . Here , we'll put a disk in so you can check out the sound . ( He puts a CD into the CD player . )

 No problem . Hope to see you again soon . 
 Yes , I'll be with you in a minute . Here's your bill , sir . It's 480 yuan altogether . 
 That's for the wine . 
 Would you like to put it on your hotel bill ? 
 Your name and room number , please ? 
 May I have a look at your room card , Mr . Black ? 

Waiter ! May I see you for while ? 
 This is not what I asked for , I'm afraid . 
 Roast beef . 
 Roast beef , of course . That's what I ordered . 

Welcome to Super Stereos . What can I do for you ?

 I'd like a dozen long-stemmed roses .

 Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . 
 That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? 
 There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend . 
 How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . 
 Don't mention it . 
 For what ? 
 All right . I ’ ll call you back later . 
 Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ? 
 All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon . 
 It's our pleasure . 
 No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . 
 This is very annoying . 
 No , I don't risk it . 
 I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening . 

Do you have any English newspapers ? 
 I'd like to see some Mandarin textbooks too . Do you have any ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm on a diet . So I have to avoid food containing too much fat . Do you have vegetarian dishes ? 
 Does it taste good ? 
 I think I'll try it . 
 French , please . 
 Milan Style Macaroni . Don't put sugar or salt on it , please . 
 I'd like to sit in the rear . 
 Yes 
 Wine , please . 
 Something real Australian . 
 Yes . That would be fine . 
 I'll have Chicken and Ginger Burger with Chilli Dressing . 
 Yes , please . 
 Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible . 
 This will be fine , thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce . ) Here you are . Can I get you anything else ? 

Excuse me . I need some storybooks in easy English . Do you have anything likethat ? 
 I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help . 

Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 Would you like anything to drink with that ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 For here or to go ? 
 That'll be $ 4.25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . 
 I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn . 
 I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . 
 Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I'd like to try the blueberry pie . 
 No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check .

 Yes , it's right over here . 
 Back there against that wall . 
 No problem . 
 Is it urgent ? Would you like the express service ? 

Can I help you ?

Hello , Jason . Are you free this Saturday evening ? 
 Would you like to Come to our barbecue ?

 Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ? 
 Relly ? That's amazing . 
 Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . 
 Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat . 
 We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then ! 
 C :: I ’ d like to have this roll of film developed . 
 C :: Four by six will do . 

Can I help you , Madam ? 
 Certainly , Madam . It's a stir fried dish of minced pork with glass noodles . 

Can you help me please ? 
 Do you know if there is Japanese restaurant near the hotel ? 
 Is it far ? 

Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible ! 
 I agree . It makes it difficult to breathe . 

Hello , sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Would you like your hair washed as well ? 
 Okay , have a seat over here . How do you want it cut ? 
 All right . 
 Fill it up . Super Unleaded . 
 I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . 
 I'll charge it . Here's my card . 
 I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos . 
 Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
 Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . 

Excuse me , I ’ d like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one ? 
 An acoustic one . 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar . 
 This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one . 
 Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well . 
 Oh , right.Thanks for your help . 

Are we here yet ? 
 How far away is it ? 
 How many miles to go ? 
 Will we be there soon ? 
 Where's the hotel ? 
 I see that . That was a nice ride . 

Welcome to Lens Magic , ma ’ am.How can I help you ? 
 Well , we ’ Ve got several point-and-shoot cameras.These are all 35mm compact cameras with auto-focus and a built-in flash.We also have these Polaroid cameras . 
 Yes , it does.But you can turn it off if you want . 
 Yes , it does.Here , I ’ ll box it up for you . 
 Okay , come right this way . 
 What bills are included in the rent ? 
 Well , I guess for $ 400 a month I shouldn't expect an all bills paid apartment . 
 Oh , okay . I can get it back when I move out , right ? 
 All right . Here's the lease and the check for the deposit . 

The mailboxes are right down there , and the laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers is over there . 
 All right , do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease ? 
 Sure . Just let us know before your lease expires . 
 Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ? 
 Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens . 
 Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more . 
 OK ... Here we are . We'll turn left at this cross . To go straight ahead is the shortest route . 

Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . 
 It was silly of me to have taken a taxi . 
 No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there . 
 The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! 
 Yes . 
 Do you know where Dawanglu is ? 
 You can take me there ? 
 That's good . 
 Let's go . 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 

Where to , ma'am ? 
 The Grand Hotel ? 
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . 
 Oh , yes . I know where it is . 
 I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . 
 thanks for understanding . 
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 
 I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . 
 well , I think you should come and have some fun . Besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . You should at least try . 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 Maybe I should go home . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 Thanks for reminding me . 
 Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 That is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds all right to us . 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Haven't been sleeping well recently . 
 Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . 
 Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . 
 Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time . 
 Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . 
 Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable . 
 Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ? 
 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . 150 ? 

Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper . 
 What's up ? 
 Thanks for the warning . 

I want to leave home , mum . 
 I am a grown-up , and I can stand on my own two feet . 

Hello . This is the Customer service . How can I help you ? 
 Sure . What ’ s your favorite number ? 
 I ’ m sorry . This number has already been registered . 
 This number is ok . It ’ s still available . When would you like your phone number changed ? 
 Sure . 

Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 

Did you promise me to get the bread ? 
 But you forgot to get the bread . 
 Well , I certainly did . 
 You are free . You can go now . 
 I'll do with the cake . 

You look upset , is there anything wrong ? 
 What is it ? 
 Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! 

Where were you last night , at exactly 920 pm ? 
 Are you sure you can't remember ? 
 Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? 
 Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? 
 Sure ? 

Hello . This is the Directory Assistance . Can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . There is no listing under that name . Are you sure of the name ? 
 Do you have her address ? 
 That ’ s an unlisted number . I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t give it to you . 
 No problem . 
 Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Four months ago . 
 But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty . 
 Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you . 

Do you like chocolates ? 
 Do you like coffee ? 
 And do you like English food ? 

Are you sure this is the right restaurant ? 
 You don't think you could be wrong ? 
 I don't know . It looks a little wrong down . 
 You're a hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? 

Here's the dress you wanted it to be made . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 This is a pity ! 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 

Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? 
 Well , come and talk to me then . 
 May I turn on the radio then ? 
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . 

Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have , fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 

Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ? 
 The chicken is also nice . 
 Our special tonight is lobster . 
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb . 
 Whatever you say . 
 But mum , I didn't mess it up . 
 Sorry , mum . I won't do it again . 

Sally , what do we have for dinner 
 Well , I quit breakfast , so I had a rich brunch . I feel like having something mild for dinner 
 Noodles are fine . Or maybe I'll have some porridge . 

Waiter , I ’ m afraid you must have calculated my bill wrong . 
 Thank you . 

How do you like the food here ? 
 There are many things I miss . You can't get the ingredients here . 
 Perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet . 
 Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
 Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
 Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration . 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 

Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
 Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly ; the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . 

Excuse me . 
 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 
 Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . 
 Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area . 
 Ok , I'll go out and look for her . 
 Well done . 
 Excellent job . 
 I'm very impressed . 
 Congratulations . You should be very proud of yourself . 
 Good . 
 Splendid . 
 That's an excellent idea . 
 I don ’ t know who placed the call . However , the call was from Toronto . 
 Sure . 416-790-1256 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . 
 Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! 
 And we ’ ll all help you . 
 Thank you , Alice . Come in to the dining-room . I ’ m going to cut the cake soon . Have some please . 
 Ok . I ’ m pretty happy and I can go abroad . 

I ’ d like to make a collect call to Beijing China , please .

John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 Really , it's so beautiful . 
 You mustn't pick it in this place . 
 It's a private garden . 
 Yes ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say ? 
 Sorry , I'm very near sighted . 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 Is this the sign ? What does it say ? 

How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 

Hello . Thank you for calling Spend Mart . 
 Yes . How can I help you ? 
 Do you have the receipt with you ? 
 I like to apologize for the problem . Please come down with your receipt and sweater to exchange it for the size you want . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Oh , French dressing . 
 We still prefer French dressing . 
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . 
 She is beautiful . 
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . 
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . 
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . 

I can ’ t decide what to do today . 
 Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? 

Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu.Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you.Ah ! But this is in French.Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ? 
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet.Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? 

Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . 
 They're all here . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . 
 Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday . Could you give me some more information about that ? 
 Mmm , that sounds very interesting . 
 Okay . But our baby has fallen sleep . 
 But where's the switch ? 

Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ? 
 Oh ok , where do I get off ? 
 Ok , thanks ... 
 No , is it difficult ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Wow , I can't thank you enough . 

May I help you ? 
 What dose she look like ? 
 What was she wearing ? 
 When did you last see her ? 
 How long has it been ? 

Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
 Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . 
 Oh , we always go to the movies.Can ' t we do something different ? 
 Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 

What shall we do tonight ? 
 That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . 
 Oh , I don't know.It depends . 
 Don ’ t you have it ? Did you lose it ? 
 Myrdal , purse doesn ’ t just disappear . Think carefully . When did you have it last ? 
 OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . 
 The Scholar ? Let me see . Oh ... yes , Of course I know . It ’ s in the Lincoln Square . 
 Oh , yes . It ’ s just a few minutes block . Turn left at the traffic light , and you ’ ll see it . 

Would you like something to eat ? 
 Would you like to call home ? 
 Please use the phone . 

What ’ s the matter , dear ? 
 Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? 
 You must tell your embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to help . 
 All you have to do is to ask for help . 
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 I'm afraid I can't . 
 Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . 
 No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems . 
 No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 Are you kidding ? The train leaves in an hour . Where did you put it ? 
 Is it in the other pocket ? 
 Let's go to the inquiry desk first to check whether anyone has got it and turned it in . 

Maybe we'd better go now . 
 Gosh , it's already 10 . Stay here if you like . 
 OK . Hurry up . 
 Oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . 
 It doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . 
 Take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Without traffic , it takes about an hour . 
 Yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 
 My pleasure , and have a good time ! 
 I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight . 
 Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ? 
 Fine . 
 Where is my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! 
 All right . I'm nearly ready . What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right . Let's go . 

Come on ! It's time to go ! 
 Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . 
 Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . 
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! 
 Oh , yes , I would ! 
 That's all right . I can manage . 
 Thanks for the warning . 
 If we hurry , can we get there in time ? 

Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . 
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 
 Not at all . 

Good afternoon ! Can I help you ? 
 This way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade . 
 Of course . The fitting room is right over there . 
 l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ? 
 Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck . 
 Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . 
 Let me see ... 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 But our younger sister is the apple of her eye . 
 Well , we can do nothing about it . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 

Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic . 

Can I help you ? 
 To buy or to rent ? 
 How much do you want to pay ? 
 Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . 
 It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . 
 Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park . 
 It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
 Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 Of course , Sir . 
 Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ? 
 All right . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 You've got it , sir . 
 Hi . I bought one of your vacuums from spend-wart . It ’ s broken now . 
 I think so . I bought it four months ago . 
 Okay . The model number is 6594 - c . 
 906 Ottawa street . My name is David Yang . My phone number is 713-786-0234 . 
 Could you tell me where the office is located ? 
 Oh , I know that place . It ’ s only two minutes drive . 
 All right . Thank you very much for your help . 

Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? 
 Is this the latest edition ? 
 What's the difference ? 
 Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please . 
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
 I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 

Hello . This is John ’ s Distribution . Can I help you ? 
 Are you completely out ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow . 
 No problem . 
 I'm not sure if we've got any now . Books of that kind are on this shelf . Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . 
 Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by then . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Let me give you a hand . The author is ... 
 Oh , yes . Here it is . 
 Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ? 
 It's $ 25 . 

Good morning ! May I help you ? 
 Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ? 
 Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? 
 I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . 
 Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences . 
 More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
 Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . 
 It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . 
 I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . 
 That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . 
 Well , I have got a vacancy . 
 Eight dollars fifty a week excluding laundry . 
 Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch . 
 Hi . I want to place an order , please . 
 Pick - up . 
 I have a menu from your restaurant . I ’ ll order using the number of each meal from your menu . 
 I ’ d like to order number 17 , no . 23 and no . 24 . 
 Medium , please . 
 I ’ ll be there in about an hour . 

May I come in ? 
 This seems a pretty nice room , I should say . 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . 
 Next Saturday at the earliest . 
 No , I'm not . 
 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day . 
 I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . 
 I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . 
 It ’ s pretty bad . 
 I am glad I did not drive a car . 
 I think something must be done . 
 I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . 
 I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . 
 About 50 miles . 
 No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . 
 But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? 

Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 

Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? 
 Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? 
 How many stops are there ? 
 Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
 By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ? 

Excuse me . When's the next bus ? 
 Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ? 
 So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ? 
 So when will it be here then ? 
 Never ? 

Where are you going , Jane ? 
 I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . 
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 Oh , no . You should take the No . 14 tram . 
 Two blocks down the street . 
 Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . 
 Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . 
 You're welcome . 
 Ordinarily , as soon as you are seated , you put your napkin on your lap . 
 At a formal dinner , you wait for your hostess to put hers on her lap first . 
 Of course , ma'am . Tell me where to go . 
 All right . There we go . 
 Where are we going ? 
 Do you have a washer down there ? 
 That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ? 
 But I didn't see you carry them down . 

Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are charged 50 cents a piece . 

How was your shopping trip Martin ? 
 Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ? 
 And how did you get around town ? 
 Right , so you didn ’ t get lost ? 

Wake up , Mary . 
 We're all going to church . Do you want to come ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Okay , then . We'll be back around noon . 

Why are you up so early , Mary ? 
 What are you watching ? 
 At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays . 
 I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults . 
 Are you kidding ? It's too early for her . 
 We also have to vacuum the house . 
 You'd better believe it . 
 No . You're going to do the entire house . 
 I'm going to mow the lawn . 
 Hi . It ’ s Tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . Is Lily there ? 
 Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ? 
 519 367 8901 . 
 Yes . I ’ m Tony . Thank you very much . 
 Bye . 
 Hi , Daddy . It ’ s me , Troy . 
 It ’ s nice . I arrived safely . 
 I ’ m fine . Is everything fine in the family ? 
 The weather is gorgeous here . 
 I will . Thank you , Dad . 
 I love you , too , Dad . Bye . 
 I had some bread for breakfast . 
 Brunch ? 
 Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . 
 The Cosby Show ? Wasn't it over many years ago ? 
 So how come it's still playing ? 
 Reruns ? 

Hello . Can I talk to David ? 
 Yes . 
 Okay . I ’ m his wife . Could you tell him to call me back when he returns ? 
 Oh , thanks . Please tell him to call my cell-phone number . 
 Thank you very much . 

Hello , Wendy speaking . 
 Hi , Gerry . How can I help you ? 
 Yes . But she is very busy right now . Can you call her later ? 
 Thanks , bye bye . 

Good morning . Do you have a small house for the 18th and 19th of this month ? 
 One bedroom will be okay . 
 You do allow pets , don't you ? 
 No problem . I don't have a dog or a cat . 

Excuse me . 
 Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
 Along Queen's Road ... 
 Right at the Hilton . 
 The Cathedral ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
 Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
 Go along this street to the traffic lights . 
 That's right , and turn left at the lights . 
 And then right at the bridge . 
 Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it . 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . 

Come to think of it , there is one rule in this house , Mary . 
 When you go out with friends , I don't want you to stay out too late . 
 We maintain a curfew for Cindy because she's just 16 . 
 You can stay out till 10 p . m . 
 Then you call me or Tom first . 
 Well , I wouldn't call them rules , but there are some things that I expect my daughter to do . 
 Setting the table and doing the dishes . 
 I also expect Cindy to tidy up her own room . 
 Yeah . She's a very responsible person . 

Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . 

Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good . Let's go now . 

Hello . This is Hamilton ’ s Heating and cooling service . Can I help you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Maybe the compressor is going bad . 
 Sure . But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . If your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge . 
 All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll call you right back . 
 Bye . 
 Why ? 
 That's right . I haven't done that yet . 
 Really ? 
 What do they mean ? 

Ah , ah , ah ... 
 Jog ? 
 Walk ? 
 Oh no . 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh no . 
 Dance class ! I don't know how . 
 Oh ... 
 Oh where was that ? 
 Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
 She will be 86 next month . 

Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . 
 OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . 
 A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . 
 All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend . 
 I want to go jogging . 

Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day at the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight . 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 

How do you want your eggs , Mary ? Cindy likes hers scrambled . 
 The toaster is over there on the kitchen counter . Help yourself . 
 White and whole-wheat . 
 Can you go wake up Cindy for me ? 
 She's a late riser . 
 Well , I swim and run every day . 
 Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . 
 Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . 
 Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . 

Hi Jane , you look great . 
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . 
 No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balanced meal . and I eat less than before . 

Hello . This is the Stewart Resident . 
 This is Mr . Stewart . Who ’ s this ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not interested in it . 

Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't had much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 

Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
 You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
 So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 

Shall we share a taxi ? 
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . 
 That's the one . 
 Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . 

Where is that ? 
 ( while driving ) Are you in a hurry ? 
 We'll make it except a jam.You know it's rush hour . 
 I'll do my best . 
 Do you have small bills ? 
 Here is your receipt.Thank you . 
 10:15 a . m . 
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . 

Is this taxi taken ? 
 Yes . Will you take me to the station ? 
 Thanks . 
 Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the 7:59 get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is it ? 
 Return , please . 
 An ordinary return , please . 
 Yes . When is the next train to New York City ? 
 Aren't there any trains before 10:30 ? 
 Then one to New York at 10:30 . 
 One way . 
 How much is a soft ? 
 Then one hard seat , please . 

Excuse me . Does this train go to Brooklyn ? 
 Do you know when it leaves ? 

What's the matter ? 
 Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . 

Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? 
 May I buy a ticket here at the station ? 
 Where ? 
 Thanks . 
 Very good . I feel quite refreshed now ! You should come with me sometime - exercise is good for you ! 
 I just ran alongside the main road . 
 Oh ok , I ’ ll try that tomorrow . It ’ ll probably be better than fighting with the traffic ! Go on , why don ’ t you come along ? 

Hello . City News . Can I help you ? 
 Okay . What ’ s your account number ? 
 And your address , please ? 
 When do you want it cancelled ? 
 Okay . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window . 
 Smoking is harmful for your health . 

What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ? 
 But isn't it served with cold milk ? 
 Chinese people don't like to eat cold food . 
 But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too . 
 With cold milk ! 
 Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . 
 The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? 
 It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? 

Please lend me some money . 
 Yeah , I really want it . I am on my uppers . 
 Thanks . 
 True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away . 

Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 
 Do I need to take a bus ? 
 How do I get there on foot ? 
 Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready . 
 Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? 
 Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? 
 Thank you very much . 

I really don ’ t understand my parents . They always make light of my worries . 
 But the child has his own feeling . 

Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? 
 Trust me . I've been driving for two years . 

Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road.Please roll down your window . 
 Have you been drinking ? 
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . 
 If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . 
 Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . 
 I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . 
 The next bus will be here in four minutes . 
 No , it's the number fifty-eight . 
 No , it won't . 
 Never . 
 That's right.The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more.It ' s stop is round the corner . 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . 
 Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . 
 Really ? Do I have to do it ? 
 Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? 
 No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . 
 Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 That is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds all right to us . 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . 
 We hope so . 
 Oh dad . You don't understand at all . 
 I don't need it to play the guitar . 
 I'm sorry . 
 No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . 
 One dollar . 
 Two stops after this one . 
 Sure . 
 No , a No . 50 will take you right there . 

Would you like any toast , dear ? 
 Toast , dear ? 
 Would you like any tea , dear ? 
 Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . 

Hello , Could I speak to Mary , please ? This is Mrs . Fort here .

 I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ? 
 How much are they ? 
 I'll take them . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat . 
 I don't know really.What ' s the fashional color this year ? 
 Good.Red suits me very well.It ' s a cheerful color , isn't it ? 
 Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . 
 I quite like this one.How much is it ? 
 Oh , that's too expensive.Aren ' t there any cheaper ones ? 
 Yes , I see . I'll take it.Here ' s $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 Oh , dear . What was in it ? 
 Well . Go to the police station and see if it ’ s there . 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is .

 Oh , yes . It ’ s just a few minutes walk . Turn left at the traffic light , and you ’ ll see it . 

What ’ s the matter , dear ?

 You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . 
 No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? 
 Don ’ t you have it ? Did you lose it ? 
 Myrdal , purse don ’ t just disappear . Think carefully . When did you have it last ? 
 OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . 
 Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
 And must I go back to school ? 
 But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 . 
 What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 

Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help you in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 Can I help you ?

 It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all . 
 Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right . 
 You are welcome . Good luck . 

Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 

Do you think I could use your car tomorrow ? I ’ Ve got a date with this girl , see ? And ... 
 Nine thirty ? That ’ s no good . Couldn ’ t I have it a bit longer ? Even if I fill up the tank ? 

I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon .

 Yes , I can see it.But what's on it ? 
 Well , there's a bench under the tree.We can sit there .

 It says No smoking . 

Could you drive me to the bank ?

 About 50 miles . 
 No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . 
 But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? 

There ’ re traffic jams everywhere . 
 Yeah . We should have more roads built . 

Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 

This is the rush hour . 
 Let ’ s drive off this road . 

Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape.It ' s a small foreign car . 
 She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles . 
 Three thousand dollars . 
 He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . 
 No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . 
 Sure , sweetie.What are you doing ? 
 OK.Why don't you just hold the ladder , and I'll put it up . 

This is the Pan-American Club.May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course.The guest speaker is Professor David of a University , and he'll be lecturing about The impact of the Oil Crisis on Latin America . 

Why don't we get ourselves a new car ? The old one's falling apart . 
 What kind shall we get ? 
 Yes , fine . 
 Why not sometime next week ? 
 OK . 
 There's a car dealer down the road.How about going there ? 
 Fine , We'll do that . 
 I'm afraid I can't . 
 Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . 
 No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems . 
 No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 Just a moment , I'm coming.Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly.Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print.There . 
 Right.Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 If only we'd remember to close it . 
 I wish I'd put it in the bank . 
 I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . 

Come on , darling.We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Oh , French dressing . 
 We still prefer French dressing . 
 Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
 No problem . 
 Oh , Never mind , I finished my paper.So you can use it tonight . 

Oh , there is something wrong with my car . 
 I want to change a new car . I like Honda best , especially the red one.But it is too expensive . 
 Yeah.Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda . 

There are something wrong with my computer . 
 The computer doesn't work when I push the power cotton . 
 Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time . 
 Yeah ! 
 OK , I'll expected you around 2 o'clock ? 

Excuse me , sir . 
 Is this your car ? 
 I'm afraid you've parked on a double yellow line , sir . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but I'll have to give you a ticket . 
 My I have your name , please , sir ? 
 Sure , let's take a look at the menu first . 
 yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time.And this will help us understand both better . 
 Right now I ' ll teach you to open files , save files and copy files . Are you ready ? 

Hello . I'm answering the ad in the paper about your car.And I wonder if it is still available ? 
 Good.Can you give me some information about it ... uh .. mileage and the tires and things like that ? 

Let's start to study how to use computers , Paubler.It ' s good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . 
 The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . 
 The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . 
 Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . 

We have a holiday next week , don't we ? 
 What're you going to do ? 
 At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? 
 But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? 
 But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? 

What's the date today Mr.Brown . I don't have a calendar . 
 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . 
 It is at 8 o'clock . 
 I don't know what time it is.It must be about 6 o'clock . I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 

Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . 
 But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
 Well , only you liked it really , darling . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Let me give you a hand.The author is ... 
 Oh , yes.Here it is . 
 Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover.which would you want to buy ? 
 It's $ 25 . 

Yes , ma'ma . May I help you with your bags ? 
 Flight 36 to Washington.It ' ll be on the plane for you . 

Good morning.May I help you ? 
 All right . Have a seat , please.Let me ask you a few questions.First of all , may I have your name , please ? 
 How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins . 
 E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald.And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ? 
 1446 Pine.That ' s in San Francisco , isn't it ? 

Are you going home now ? 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
 An apartment ? Why ? 
 Where are you living now ? 
 How are you going to find an apartment ? 
 Apartments in the city are expensive . 

Can I help you ? 
 To buy or to rent ? 
 How much do you want to pay ? 
 Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . 
 It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . 
 Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park . 
 It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
 Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 Of course , Sir . 
 I'm looking for books on WTO.Could you show me where they are ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . 
 Will you have it later ? 
 That's terrific.Thank you . 
 Who is the author ? 
 Sorry , we ' re sold out right now.Please come back next week . 

Excuse me.Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . 
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . 
 Ok , I will . 
 The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner.The station is at the end of that street . 
 It's about a ten-minute walk . 
 Not at all . 
 Yes , they all stop at this corner . 
 You can take any bus except the Number 9 . 
 They run about every five minutes . 
 About fifteen minutes.It ' s not far.Are you a stranger in New York ? 
 How do you like New York city ? 
 You'll soon get accustomed to it.It ' s not difficult.Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full . 
 Don't mention it . 
 I'm going to the hospital to see Susan . 
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? 
 Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? 
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 

Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ? 
 Where can I take it ? 

Excuse me . 
 Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
 Along Queen's Road ... 
 Right at the Hilton . 
 The Cathedral ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you.Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
 Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
 Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road . 
 Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right . 

Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Walk down this road , take the fourth turn to the right.Then you'll see it . 
 No . It's only about five minutes ' walk . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ? 
 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . 
 It can ’ t be time to get up yet . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 My watch says ten past . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 
 It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . 
 I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . 
 No , Mum , I'd rather stay inside . 
 I prefer staying at home and watching TV . 
 Yes , but a football game is next . 
 I just enjoy watching games . 

Excuse me , sir , Is this the road to the peace Store ? 
 Where's Wort Street , please ? 
 How far is it from the Wort Street ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , of course.Would you like to walk there or take a bus ? 
 It's just about ten minutes ' walk . Go along this street , on the third cross you'll find it on your left . 
 Not at all . 
 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do youknow whose watch it is ? 
 Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place . 
 She is now in a private school . 
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 

Michael , it is time to wake up . 
 Yes , it is time to wake up . And , also , from now on I will speak only English to you . And you should speak only English to me , too . 
 Right . That's good . 
 I know you can do it . 
 That is great . All I want is for you to do your best in everything you do . 
 Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available . 
 $ 30.00 a week . 
 I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? 
 Who ’ s calling ? 
 Hold on , I ’ ll get her . 

Oh ! Is it too hot ? I'm sorry . 
 OK ! Here you go . 

Hello . 
 Hi , Dad . Where are you ? 
 Thank you , Dad . 
 I love you , too , Dad . 
 I told you to hold my calls . I ’ m very busy at the moment . 
 Okay . Put her through . 

Excuse me . I wonder if you can help me . 
 I'm completely lost . I'm trying to find the way to my daughter's home . 
 Her home is between the China hotel and Li Sheng Theater . 
 I'm grateful to you . 

Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . 
 Red . 
 May I try it on ? 
 Is there a mirror around here ? 
 Does it suit me ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That's quite reasonable . 
 Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . 
 I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . 
 It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . 
 Let me see . A roasted duck is 15 dollars . A plate of pork is 10 dollars . A bowl of beef is 6 dollars . Two bottles of beer are 3 dollars.That ' ll be a total of 34 dollars . 
 Oh , sorry , sir.We take no tips here.Thank you all the same . 
 How much is it ? Eight films and a bar of chocolate . 
 Can you accept a check ? 
 Here's two twenties.Keep the change . 

What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 What size do you take ? 
 How about this pair ? They're well-made . 
 In fact , They'll stretch a bit later . 
 All right.Here you are . 

I want to buy a wallet . 
 May I pick it up ? 
 Do you have one of better quality ? 
 There is no problem about the price . How much is it ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 We're redecorating our living room . 
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 
 Pale yellow . 
 We're going to put in some new furniture . 
 Yes , could you show me to your coat section ? 
 Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . 
 I'd like to try them on for size . 
 This seems to be my size . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Alright , I'll get it . 
 Here you are.It ' s 90 yuan , miss . 
 20 percent is the best discount I can offer . That will came to 72yuan . 
 Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in . 
 I'll just have this all wrapped up for you . 
 Yes . My car is having problems . 
 It won't start . 
 No , thank you . I think I can handle it . 
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . 
 I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . 
 OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . 
 Yes . I have a spare room . 
 10.00 dollars a night . 
 Sure.Come on in . 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
 You need a babysitter . 
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
 Why not ? 
 I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 

A friend told me I might find a room here . 
 What do you charge ? 
 Fine.Would it be OK to look at the room ? 

I wonder if you can help me . I ’ m looking for a room . 
 How much do you charge ? 
 OK.Can I see the room now ? 

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I have plenty of gas . 
 So what can we do ? 
 Alright . That's a good idea . 
 Days ? 
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 

Do you take in students ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Do you think I could have a look at it , please . 

What's happening , officer ? 
 What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! 
 I can smell smoke ! 
 OK . 
 Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box . 
 Gosh ! I can see the flames ! 

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 Yeah , I just cannot find it anywhere . 
 You are risking your neck . Don ’ t you know they have guns . 
 But I am still worry about them . I ’ m afraid ... 
 Well , I won ’ t put a crime into their doings . 
 Why ? He did something wrong . 
 I only wanted to help him . 

What a mess , Jack ! 
 You ’ d better tidy up the room now , or you ’ ll get your mum ’ s back up . 
 Oh , yeah . We will have winter holiday . 
 Don ’ t worry , mum . I will study hard tomorrow . 

I have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children . 
 My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely . 

Where is our son , dear ? 
 What happened ? Have you talked with him ? 

Ann ! Don ’ t you see the children are making so much noise here ? Why don ’ t you keep them occupied and out their mother ’ s hair ? 
 Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you . 
 What ? I gave it to you only 3 months ago . 
 Ok , son . I think I ’ Ve go to tell you the truth . My company has gone out and I ’ m now out of job . If you want a new camera , go and earn money yourself . 
 I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf . 
 No , thank you . I can manage it , I think . 
 What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk . 

I really don ’ t know how to teach my son . He's getting far above himself . 
 Maybe you are right . I will discuss it with my wife tonight . 
 Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? 
 Take it easy . They will get caught . 
 Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? 

I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? 
 But each children has his own interest . 

Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . 
 But we need the exact time . What time ? 

Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . 
 I think you are flicking through it . 

Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . 
 Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . 

Hello ? 
 No , not out of order . But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . I can ’ t hear you clearly . 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . 
 Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ? 

There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ? 
 I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course . 
 Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap . 
 Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking . 

Why didn ’ t you call me last night ? 
 Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ? 
 Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then . 

Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . 
 I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? 
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! 
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 
 Wow . That sounds really good . 
 I'm watching TV . 
 I will . 

You know , you really ought to get a new pair of jeans . Those are falling to pieces . 
 Well , you ’ d better get another pair for work at least or you ’ re sacking on the spot . 
 Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
 And must I go back to school ? 
 But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I'm nearly 17 . 
 What else I've got to do ? Join the army ? 

Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 I feel kind of stupid . 
 We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . 
 No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . 
 I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . 
 Guess where we ended up . 
 When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . 
 I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . 
 I know it is . I don't know how it happened . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Oh , that's what you think , huh ? 
 Yes ? What can I do for you ? 
 And what is the problem ? 
 Let me see ... I'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms.We won't charge you for your room tonight . 
 I'm very sorry about this . 

What's the matter , Paul ? 
 So , what are you going to do ? 
 I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon . 
 Sure . That's no problem . 
 Here you go . Anything else ? 

There was a serious disturbance in the street this morning . 
 Yes . The police have come . 
 But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! 
 That would be too late . 
 Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . 
 I lost one of my contact lenses , and I ’ m searching high and low for it . 
 Thank you very much . I think I lost it near the window . 
 What for ? 
 It is really a hot potato . 
 My hands are full . Can ’ t you see that ? 
 All right . Just wait a minute , OK ? 
 I cannot , Mum . Nobody can help me ! 

I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . 
 He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . 
 Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . 
 It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . 
 I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . 
 I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . 
 And what does your husband do ? 
 But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard . 

Wow , it has a balcony . 
 How many windows are there in the apartment ? 
 It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign . 
 Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ? 
 It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone . 
 It usually comes out about $ 40 a month . 
 No , I am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted . 
 Sorry , that ’ s out of question . I don ’ t have a problem with it . But , unfortunately , the building doesn ’ t allow it . It ’ s a building regulation . 
 Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner . 
 It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ? 
 Of course . I almost missed my own wedding . 
 Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place . 
 I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . 
 You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job . 
 I'm OK . 
 OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 
 First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . 
 OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . 
 Mm , it is . 
 Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . 
 Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! 
 Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick . 
 You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive . 
 It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food . 
 Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides . 
 I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests . 

I learned of the railway accident only this morning . 
 Is that true ? 
 Thanks . 
 No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ? 
 Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar stuff . You like this place ? 
 Yeah . Other than that , the real feature are the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? 
 Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ? 
 I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention . 

Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? 
 Great . Let's go . Where is it ? 
 We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? 
 So let's go and catch earth worms ! 
 Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . 
 I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ? 
 Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill . 
 Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . 
 I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? 
 Well , wait a minute . 
 Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit . 
 Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision . 
 I want to have a look at the microwave ovens . 
 Not really . What are these toys over there ? 
 I don't like its color . A bit too bright . Do you have a grey one ? 
 Really ? How so ? 
 Okay . 
 How about its quality ? 
 What about the price ? 

Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Why ? 
 OK , did you bring your household register or residence booklet ? 
 It doesn't matter , they are the same thing . 
 OK , I will register you in our database system . What's your name , please ? 
 Please get a mug shot in the next room . 
 But we need them taken with digital cameras . 
 That's all . Come here a week later and get your ID card . 
 Sure , let's take a look at the menu first . 
 yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time . And this will help us understand both better . 
 Right now I'll teach you to open files , save files and copy files . Are you ready ? 

What are you doing to your house ? 
 What are you going to do to it ? 
 What colour are you going to paint them ? 
 What else are you going to do ? 

You stay beside me ; I'll fry the meat in the oil first . 
 Er , I am gonna go with salt and sauce ! 
 Is there anything wrong ? 

Mom ! How can I help with the washing up ? 
 OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ? 
 OK , got it . 
 Reading newspaper on the couch . 
 Staying with Ultraman , of course . You know he likes it very much . 
 I will . 
 OK ! 
 About 50 miles . 
 No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . 
 But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? 

John , it ’ s time to get up . 
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
 It ’ s nearly half past seven . 
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
 Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . 
 No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . 

We have a holiday next week , don't we ? 
 What're you going to do ? 
 At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? 
 But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? 
 But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? 

what's your favourite steps ? 
 how about rock and roll 。 
 and can you dance tango ? 
 don't be so modest . i am sure you can dance it very well . then i'll see you at six . is that all right ? 
 great . i am your lucky fellow then . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 

Oh , there is something wrong with my car . 
 I want to change a new car . I like Honda best , especially the red one . But it is too expensive . 
 Yeah . Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda . 

Can I help you ? 
 Let me see ... the train to New York City ... here it is ... daily except Sunday at 10 thirty , 12 twenty and 15 ten . 
 Sorry , not before 10 thirty . 
 One way or round trip ? 
 A soft seat or hard one ? 
 $ 15 . And for a hard one , only $ 6 . 
 OK . Here is your change . The train leaves on platform 8 . 
 10 fifteen a . m . 
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . 

What's the matter ? 
 Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . 
 It's not on this platform . These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown . You have to go up these stairs over there . 
 Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the 7 fifty-nine get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is it ? 
 Return , please . 
 An ordinary return , please . 
 Oh , she did ? Then it's a used car of course . 
 What else did she tell you ? Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ? 
 That's not bad . What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ? 
 Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? 
 Well , we can see it for ourselves . Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ? 

Hi , Nancy . How are you doing ? 
 Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . 
 You mean used cars ? 
 Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problems . 
 It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . 
 Let's look at them all . Have you got a paper there ? 
 certainly , i love waltz very much . 
 a couple of times a week . i've got a regular dancing partner . he is really some dancer 
 right now ? 
 i think i'll be a little afraid . 
 afraid of making a mistake . 
 all right . i'll give it a try . 
 sure . i suppose you dance much . 
 but i can see you dance wonderfully well . 
 no , just occasionally 
 i'm afraid i can't dance well . 
 I am going to buy some food to cook for supper . 
 How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping . 
 Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ? 
 Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage . 
 There we go . 
 Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . 
 Several minutes . 
 Then , pass me a bowl for the soup . 
 Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! 
 Check the drawer . 
 Can it hold soup ? 
 It smells sweet . Mom and May are gonna love it . Get them for dinner , Daniel ! 

Oh , come on , Ultraman ! 
 It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today . 
 Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? 
 That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? 
 OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . 
 Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . 
 All right , all right . 
 Not yet , Dad . I am watching Ultraman instead.No , no , Dad . Please . This program is on only once a week . 
 What makes you think that ? 
 But there are cartoons on TV . Bees , big trees , seas , and a lot of other interesting things . 
 About 6 . 
 Dad , it's not fair . I am so disappointed with you ! 
 Will do . 
 Ma'am , take your kid to school ? 
 No problem . Don't worry , the taxi is faster than the bus . 
 My son is the same . But he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the English programmer Let's talk in English on the way . 
 OK ! 
 It's 14.5 Yuan . 
 Thanks , Ma'am . 
 No , just a super-boy . 
 Yes , because a real man doesn't need Mom to worry about him so much . He can do things by himself . 
 Oh , my poor Danny , sure , you are a man . But you know , running like this in street is very dangerous . 
 Do you remember the rules of road safety ? 
 Walk the sidewalk and please right-hand side . 
 Yes , so you still remember , ah . 

Let's start to study how to use computers , Paler . It's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . 
 The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . 
 The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . 
 Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . 

That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier . 
 Mom , you are the best ! 
 Mom , come on . What are you thinking about ? 
 Don't tell me you want me to do that ? 
 But I don't like playing the piano . And the homework keeps me busy enough . 
 How depressed ! 
 No problem . 
 Oh , Never mind , I finished my paper . So you can use it tonight . 

Dad , where is the Book Building ? 
 She said that when we get off the bus , the Book Building is right by the bus stop . 
 Oh , Dad , look at the sign , please ! 
 OK , Dad , it happens . 
 Come on , I'm too tired ! 
 Sure , I promise . 

Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now . 
 Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . 
 I do wish your christmas and happy new year . 

There are something wrong with my computer . 
 The computer doesn't work when I push the power cotton . 
 Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time . 
 Yeah ! 
 OK , I'll expected you around 2 o'clock ? 

How do you want your hair cut ? 
 Who is Peckham ? 
 You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . 
 Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ? 
 But it's the same hairstyle . 
 Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . 
 Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . 

How many rooms are you looking for ? 
 150 a month . 

What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . 
 Sure . 
 Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ? 
 No . I'm thinking that maybe I can get my hair shampooed . 
 How come ? 
 Then I won't say no to that . 
 I feel totally refreshed . 
 This time included ? 
 Then yes . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a house . 
 Oh , to rent . 
 About 300 a month . 
 How big is it ? 
 Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's it like ? 
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 

I feel like to wear my hair in this way . 
 Do you think it's suitable for me ? 
 Even though I really like it , it's just too modern for me . 
 Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored . 
 Claret-red . 
 How long will it take ? I hope it won't be too long . 
 Now it's my son's turn to wait . 
 Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 That is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds all right to us . 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Yes , I'd like to have this parcel delivered to Shanghai . 
 Thanks ! ... Hello , I have a parcel to deliver . 
 I want to post it to Shanghai . 
 Sure , what's the postcode of Shanghai ? 
 Thanks , here you go . What's the postage , please ?

 Have a seat over there . I'll pack it up for you right away . 

Can I help you , Ma'am ? 
 Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ? 
 Then the M-Zone will be suitable . 
 You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that . 
 Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now . 
 If you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free . 
 Sure . As many as you want . 

Can I have my check , please . 
 May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it . 
 Thank you . 
 Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ? 
 Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now . 
 You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ? 
 Got it . Bye for now . 
 Here you go . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 There must be a mistake . 
 Wait , can you check these sunglasses I bought it in the second floor . I think they forgot to demagnetize it . 
 Of course I did . Here is the receipt . 
 That's all right . 
 I think a surprise party may be better . But I forget when her birthday is . 
 Sorry . What shall we get for her ? 
 Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ? 
 Sure . Okay , here is the website . 
 Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet . 
 The computer went frozen . 

The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . 
 Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . 
 Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? 
 I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . 
 We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe . 
 Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . 
 We got a problem . The deposit boxes are all full . We should have come earlier . 
 Did you ? I didn't hear you . It was too noisy . 
 They say we can't . They don't look after customers ' stuff . 
 OK , it's my fault . I'll stay here and look after our stuff . You can get in , shopping with Daniel and May . 
 Hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me . 
 Black , of course . 
 Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ? 
 It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ? 
 I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly . 
 He can speak English , too . 
 Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird . 
 Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? 
 Me what ? 
 It's not for us . 
 Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . 
 It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . 
 Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . 
 Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . 
 Pretty well . What about you ? 
 It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . 
 Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? 
 Did you go to a real estate agent ? 
 That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . 

Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled ! 
 Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ? 
 Whatever . Have a drink of water . 
 Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit . 
 Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it . 
 Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no ! 
 Keep lying down . The matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration . 

What a beautiful day ! 
 I was worried about canceling the climbing . 
 What about taking the cable car ? 
 Wow , What a long queue this is ! 
 Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky . 
 So you wanna stay here ? 

That's unfair , Mom . 
 Dad is bigger than you , but how come I'm smaller than May . 
 What should I do ? 
 Got it , Mom . 
 Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it . 
 OK . Bingo ! We win . Give me five , Mom . 
 Take it easy , madam . And speak slowly . May I have your name first ? 
 What's your son's name ? 
 Can you describe his appearance to me ? 
 OK , I see . Dear Daniel , please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this , your mother is waiting for you . If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes , 1.4 meters , please ask him to go to the broadcasting station . Thank you ! 
 Just kids like that . 
 Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! 
 What's that ? 
 That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? 
 Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ? 
 Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face . 
 It is called Energy Collector . 
 Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting . 
 Me too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? 
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . 
 So you can prove you are a man . 
 It's just you ! 
 How does she cook the shrimp ? 
 I don't like that . I like fried food , fried potatoes , fried chicken , fried sausage ... I can't see why fried food is not healthy . 
 It's all right ! I often fry sausages when my mom is not at home . 
 Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! 

Tom , we are in the restaurant now ! 
 I'd like to see the menu , please . 
 Thanks . I am starving . Tom , what are you getting ? 
 Let me see ... What's this , shrimp rolls ? 
 Twenty five yuan is a little expensive . 
 Sounds nice . We will take this , two bowls of shrimp rolls . 
 We will have this one first and order something else later . 

Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . 
 But I saw a red car always parking here before . 
 Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left . 
 Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check . 
 Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space . 

How big is this parking lot in our community ? 
 So you guys should be always busy . 
 I bet it is always full of cars . 
 Ah ... I see . 
 What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? 
 How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? 
 That's expensive . 
 What happened ? 
 Where ? my car ? 
 Thank goodness ! 
 That's terrible . 
 I apologize for that . But the space is too small . 
 Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company . 

I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . 
 The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ? 
 There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ? 
 That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space . 
 No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking . 
 No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed . 
 Yes ! How do you know that ? 

Excuse me , I'm lost . Can you show me where I am in this map ? 
 That's great ! It's not my day . I just have very bad sense of direction . 
 I am supposed to go to Liu Ichang . 
 Yes . Yes . Can you tell me how to get there ? 

Excuse me , did you see a set of keys ? 
 Five keys and a small foot ornament . 
 Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys . 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Should I take a look at your battery ? 
 Your car is ready . 
 250 yuan , please ! 
 You should know about the oil crisis . 
 Honey , I have a lot of work to do . 
 No . 
 What park do you want to go to ? 
 Haven't we been these places already ? 
 What about the Olympic park ? 
 The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic . 

May , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? 
 Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all.This is your father's favorite sausage . Sandwiches for you and Daniel . 
 Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
 All set . May , can you help me take all these things to the living room ? 
 Ask Daniel to give you a hand ? 

Look , Dad , many people are doing morning exercises here . 
 Really ? You were so happy then . 
 Daddy , don't mention it . 
 Dad , I'd like to take a picture with the status . 
 Daddy , we can't have a photo of the whole family . We can take one here . 

Hey , look , there is a circus show over there . 
 It's the circus . 
 Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . 
 Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it . 
 Why are you acting so strange today ? 
 That's weird ! 
 I wasn't kidding before , OK , I'm fine now . 
 Yes . 
 What are you saying ? You are acting weird today . 
 Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me . 
 Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel . 
 Hope so . 
 Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . 
 Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ? 
 OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao . 
 Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun . 
 Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . 
 Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! 
 Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time . 
 What did you do last weekend ? 
 Did you play football with other children ? 
 Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . 
 After that , we will have a picnic . 
 Okay , it sounds good . 
 It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . 
 You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . 
 Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . 
 Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . 
 There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . 
 No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . 
 It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . 
 It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . 
 That's what I am going to do . 
 I surely will . How much is this wood carving ? 
 That's OK . Is anything else recommended ? 
 I'd like to see some traditional arts . 
 Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . 
 Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . 
 You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale . 
 Wow , you are the expert on it . 
 Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . 
 You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . 
 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! 
 Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . 
 Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction . 
 Let's click to check it out . 
 No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits . 
 It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon . 
 Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . 
 Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . 
 Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . 
 You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . 
 There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . 
 It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? 
 OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ? 
 OK , then 50 Yuan for dessert . 500 Yuan all together . 
 I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . 
 Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . 
 Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . 
 Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? 
 Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . 
 It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . 
 No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . 
 I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . 
 Yeah . I have a fancy for some wine tonight . Can you recommend something for me ? 
 All right . What kind of red wine do you serve ? 
 The dry red wine looks quite good . I'd like to try this one . 
 Why ? Do I have to order that ? 
 That's really nice . I'd like this one . It looks very attractive . 
 Croissant for appetizer and two beef steaks for dinner . 
 Medium , please ? 
 Sure . We'd like to have Black Forest Cake for dessert . 

What can I do for you ? 
 OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . 
 Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' . 
 Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . 
 Never mind . You can leave them to me . 
 It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know . 
 That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice . 
 Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage . 
 I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon . 
 Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ? 
 It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . 
 Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go . 
 I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . 
 This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time . 
 Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service . 
 I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . 
 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 
 I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that . 
 Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
 Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? 
 It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? 
 What about the performance itself ? 
 Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . 
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? 

Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool . 
 Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . 
 See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
 You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ? 
 Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ? 
 Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . 
 Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 
 It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of presents do you want ? 
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 
 Just a hunch , sir . 
 $ 59.95 . 
 Sorry , sir . 
 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . 
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 
 It's $ 60 here . 
 Of course not , sir . 

I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . 
 Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . 
 Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . 
 OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . 
 Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . 
 He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . 
 Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic ! 
 I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day . 

What can I do for you , young man ? 
 What sizes do you need ? 
 Here you are . And here are three crash helmets . 
 Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . 
 That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings . 
 Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on . 

I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . 
 Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . 
 That was last time . This time it's worse . 
 Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... 
 True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... 
 And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . 
 Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . 

Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . 
 Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . 
 Sure . 
 Lily , I ’ m not sure . Let me check , I think I spent $ 50 . 
 I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ m sorry , too . It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities . 
 I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with . 
 No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus . 
 Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ... 
 Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do . 
 I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son . 

Grandpa , this seat is for you , for you are the eldest person here and also it's your birthday today . 
 I'm afraid I can't do that . It's Dad's seat , according to the book about table manners . 
 Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake . 
 Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ? 
 I see . Then I'll try it . 
 Some what ? 
 No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? 
 Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? 
 What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . 

Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ? 
 Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn . 
 I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola . 
 Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ? 
 Sure . Is it sweet ? 
 Great , I want it spicy . 
 I want it to be special . And you know that I always like hot food . 

Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . 
 Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . 

What ? Your golden watch is lost ? 
 It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . 

Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . 
 Are you serious ? How can that be ? 
 Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . 
 Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! 
 Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . 
 Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . 
 Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . 
 Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . 

Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? 
 OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific . 
 We are lucky to play in a new stadium . 
 Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . 
 Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . 
 No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . 
 But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . 
 Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . 

Tom , is Jenny crying ? 
 I ’ m just coming for that . 
 She ’ s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 

Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? 
 Trust me . I've been driving for two years . 

What can I do ? 
 Did you go to any illegal website ? 
 Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . 
 That's wise . 
 One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . 
 Of course . You'd better learn something about it . 
 Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? 

What did the boss say ? 
 You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . 
 Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? 
 Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . 
 And a good way to get some pocket money . 
 I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card . 
 Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive . 
 Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first . 
 But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . 
 There are four more stops . 
 What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! 
 No , not on the train , but in the station . 
 Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? 
 I guess you'll never forget today . 
 It's my pleasure , what can I do for you ? 
 What brings you here ? 
 Where are you staying ? 
 Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place . 
 We sell them , right here . 

Daniel , here is some money for the tickets . 
 Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . 
 They may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . 
 You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . 

I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first . 
 Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . 
 How much will it cost in that case ? 
 Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving . 
 The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ? 

That was really a nightmare ! 
 I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . 
 I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . 
 A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . 
 Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . 
 Yes . I have to call the property management . 
 Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . 
 I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . 
 What ? 
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Huh ? I can't hear you , the music's too loud . 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 
 I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . 
 That's good . It's good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . 

Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ? 
 Are you having any luck ? 
 Do you mind if I go with you ? 
 I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store . 
 I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . 
 I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . 
 Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? 
 Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? 

Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . 
 They spend hours there , especially on weekends . 
 I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 
 No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . 
 Sure . I love going to the mall . 

Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? 
 Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . 
 What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? 
 So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? 
 Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . 

Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? 
 You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? 
 Then how can you explain your behavior ? 
 Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? 
 On a cell phone ? 
 That's definitely true . I'm going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . 
 I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . 
 Here ’ s an interesting ad 
 The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . 
 It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . 
 Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? 
 I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . 
 Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . 
 Which bank ? There are two , the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland . 
 You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre , Dunned Stores . 
 Cross the road and turn left at the other side . Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left . 
 It's not so complicated . It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish . 
 You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area . 
 It depends on the type of the house you're looking for . 
 What ’ s your general price range ? 
 Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . 
 A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . 
 I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . 

Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? 
 Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? 
 So this would be your first automobile ? 
 Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . 
 So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! 
 Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . 
 Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? 
 I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . 
 Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . 
 Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly . 
 It depends . 
 Certainly . 
 Yes . 
 I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet . 
 Where is the house ? 
 Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? 
 Does that include utilities ? 
 That ’ s a little expensive . 
 Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ? 
 That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ? 
 All right ! Thank you . 
 Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square . 
 Oh , good . Can you describe it ? 
 So is there a refrigerator ? 
 It sounds great . How much is the rent ? 
 When can I see it ? 
 Ok , that would be great . 
 Hello , Todd ! 
 Yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people . 
 How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . 
 Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . 
 Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile . 
 I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . 
 Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they . 
 We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . 
 You know on a date , they are going out to dinner . 
 Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . 
 That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? 
 It's ten after six.We ' re late.But dinner is at six thirty . 
 I'll call the lost and found office . 

Is there anything wrong ? 
 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . 
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
 Oh , she can make her own decisions . 
 Believe me . Everything will be ok . 

Hi , Jone , how are you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Oh , no ! Did you call the police ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm going to give you some advice , Jone.If this happens again , you should call the police immediately . You should try to remember everything . You should explain everything to the police . 
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . 
 She is beautiful . 
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . 
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . 
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . 

Excuse me . 
 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 
 Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . 
 Really . 
 Oh , I don ’ t care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 

Please show me the menu , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please . 

Excuse me , I'd like to make a suit of this material . 
 Yes . Should I take off my coat ? 
 Please make a single-breasted . 
 How much does it cost ? 
 All right . When can I get it ? 
 Thank you . 
 What kind of style do you want ? 
 Now let me take your measurements . 
 Three days later . 
 Bye-bye . 
 No , I'm not . 
 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day . 
 I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . 
 I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management . 
 Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . 
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
 Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler . 
 After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it . 
 These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . 
 Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . 
 I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe ! 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need . 
 I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ? 
 Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ? 
 What kind of cheese do you want . 
 We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ? 

Did you promise me to get the bread ? 
 But you forgot to get the bread . 
 Well , I certainly did . 
 You are free . You can go now . 
 I'll do with the cake . 

Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
 Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . 
 Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . 
 No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . 

What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? 
 It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ? 
 I might get one too , but in a different colour . I prefer light blue to while . 
 I ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . 
 Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . 
 Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . 
 About ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . 
 Yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ’ s in use . 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 That ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 Yeah how ’ d you know ? 
 Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . 
 Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . 
 Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! 

Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 
 Do I need to take a bus ? 
 How do I get there on foot ? 
 Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready . 
 Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? 
 Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? 
 Thank you very much . 

So can you fix it ? 
 What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
 OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? 
 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 

I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . 
 I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else . 
 Just a few Christmas gifts , to this season , after all ! 
 Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole ! 
 You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . 
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! 
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! 

Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! 
 This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now ! 
 Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight . You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted . 
 Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ? 
 Great ! Can you set the table ? 
 Wait ! Don ’ t turn it on ... 
 What is that ? 
 Cool ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 
 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! 
 I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! 
 Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? 
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! 
 What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
 I ’ m going as fast as I can ! 
 You ’ re such a geek ! 
 Yes . 
 My name is James . 
 American . 
 I don't know him . 
 Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . 
 I stabbed his belly three times . 
 I knew , but I couldn't control myself . 
 No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney . 

Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! 
 You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs . 
 You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody . 
 We've found some heroin at your house . 
 That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
 Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 
 What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
 OK . What do you want to know ? 
 OK . 
 Here you are . 
 Two years . 
 I'm a professor at a university . 
 I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes . 

Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! 
 What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? 
 Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . 

What happened ? 
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? 
 Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . 
 Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . 

Hi . What can I get for you ? 
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . 
 No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs . 
 Okay , is there anything else ? 
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... 
 Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... 
 Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . 
 Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ? 
 Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons . 
 Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . 
 Yeah I got a club card . Here you go . 
 Debit please . Also , could I get cash back ? Fifty dollars would be great . 

Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? 
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . 
 You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ? 
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 

Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! 
 Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! 
 Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! 
 Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! 
 You look a little lost , can I help you ? 
 Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties . Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . 
 This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? 
 Just pick something and get the hell out of here . Um , I'll go with these two . This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with . She better thank me for this ... 
 Finally ! 

Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . 
 Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . 
 Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . 
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . 

Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... 
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... 
 Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money ! 
 No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! 
 No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money ! 

Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking . May I take your order ? 
 We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ? 
 Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ? 
 Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free ! 
 Sir , wait ! ! I need your address ! 
 NO ! 
 Okay , okay , what do you want ? 
 Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother . 
 Who's this Eric guy ? 
 No can do ... sorry . 
 No way ! 

Can you tell me what happened here ? 
 Did you see the car before it hit you ? 
 Which lane were you in ? 
 What was your speed then ? 
 Which direction were you coming from ? And which direction were you going ? 
 OK , please move your vehicle off to the side of the road . We will check on it . Do you feel like you need an ambulance , Miss ? 
 No problem , Miss . 
 There ’ s branch on new street . Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights . Then turn right at the traffic lights . 
 Now far . About 150 meters perhaps . 
 Then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . 
 You ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . 

What do we need to get from the supermarket ? 
 A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? 
 we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . 
 I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . 
 We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves . 
 I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . 
 I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go . 
 The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . 
 There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there . 
 Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak Japanese . 
 Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . 
 Sure . There you are . 
 Yes , I do . I find it very informative . It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . 
 Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . 
 Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . 
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 

Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window . 
 Have you been drinking ? 
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . 
 If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . 
 Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . 
 I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . 
 I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
 Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . 
 Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . 
 Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? 

I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
 I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
 You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ” 
 Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . 
 Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs . How old is your cat now ? you ’ Ve had her longer than we ’ Ve had our dog . 
 Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! 
 Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ? 
 Have you ever thought about having another pet ? 

What are you reading ? 
 I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
 We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ? 
 Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
 This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 
 What do you have ? 
 Can I have apple pie with ice cream ? 
 I love you home made apple pie . It ’ s delicious . Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? 
 Ok . Would you like a drink too ? 
 Are you having any dessert ? 

What game do you like ? 
 I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . 
 I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? 
 Do you play bridge ? 
 I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? 
 I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours . 
 Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . 
 Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? 
 We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . 
 Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? 
 You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . 
 That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . 
 I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . 
 Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? 
 Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . 
 Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . 
 Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet . 
 I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless . 
 Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time . 
 Yes , it is . I'll be coming here regularly . I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape . 
 I was told that the first time I came heer . I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . I need to build up slowly . 

What do we need for the barbecue ? 
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ? 
 And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . 
 I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce . 
 How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? 
 They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it . 

Do you like cooking ? 
 I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . 
 So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . 
 Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? 
 How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ? 

Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . We also eat a lot of lamb . 
 That ’ s right . They tastes so good ! We eat them with mint sauce . Have you every tried them ? 
 I certainly can . If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you . 

Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! 
 Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! 
 But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair ! 
 Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower . 
 Thanks mom ! 
 Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . 
 Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play . 
 Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . 
 We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! 
 The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! 
 How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! 
 Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? 
 Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . 
 I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . 
 Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . 
 Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . 

The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
 So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? 
 How long did it take you to do the tiling . 
 I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 

Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? 
 I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? 
 I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square metres . 
 Ok . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? 
 New furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . 
 That wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? 
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . 
 I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . 

I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? 
 I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe . 
 Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . 
 Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . 
 Yes , we do . The most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ? 
 Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? 
 I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . 
 Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . 
 We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . 
 A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . 
 Ok , what do you want me to do ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 
 While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meal , by the way . 
 My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? 
 Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 
 Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . 
 You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ? 
 He might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy . 
 It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look . 
 That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . 

How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? 
 Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
 Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ? 
 I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? 
 These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 
 Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ? 
 That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it . 
 That ’ s right . Sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars . 
 Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks . 
 No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra . 
 There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye . 
 I seem to have lost my train ticket . 
 I ’ m supposed to be going to shanghai . 
 It ’ s supposed to leave in 30 minutes . 
 S M I T H . 
 Z3264356 . 
 Is there anything you can do for me ? If I don ’ t make it to shanghai in time , my wife is going go kill me . 
 How much is that going to cost me ? 
 I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! 
 Yes , fine . Let me see how much money I have in my wallet . 
 Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! 
 You ’ re right . It is . Let me have a look . I have 419.6 RIB . is that enough ? 
 Thanks , ma ’ am . You ’ re a lifesaver ! 
 Yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . 
 We ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? 
 About 7 thirty . 
 My name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7 thirty on Friday . 
 Oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good . 
 Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . 
 Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . 
 It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south . 
 That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . 
 Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 . 
 The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ? 
 It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . 

Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? 
 Why ? 
 Could it be the battery ? 
 Well , I suppose it could be the gas . 
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 

Excuse me , can you tell me the way to Holton railway station ? 
 I think I ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t ? 
 Yes , I do . They are about two miles away , right ? 
 So , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . Got it . 
 Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help . 

Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . 
 You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . 
 Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . 
 What a good idea ! 
 We could go to more places this time , if you liked . 
 When shall we go and look ? 
 No , let's go on Saturday . 
 Where shall we go ? 
 No , I don't like that place . Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended ? 

Hello , this is Rich . 
 He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 Does have your telephone number ? 
 3725015281 ? 
 Right . I ’ ll have him call you back . 
 Sure can . 
 No problem . 
 Goodbye . 
 If only we'd remember to close it . 
 I wish I'd put it in the bank . 
 I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . 
 It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company . 

Come on , darling . We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too ! 
 Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? 
 That won't take long . 
 Well , I'm not quite ready . 
 You wouldn't do a thing like that ! 

Why aren't you doing your homework ? 
 Oh , is it ? You'll be making records next , will you ? 
 You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
 I certainly could . You'll get exams next month . 
 Oh , don't you ? God save me ! 

May I help you , ma'ma ? 
 First you must check in at Counter No . 4 . 
 That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 . 

Mom , may I play the card games for a while ? 
 I won't make any noise . Mom , please . 
 Yes , I ' Ve finished . 
 er ... , mom , I promise . I won't make a single noise . 
 Ok . I won't get into trouble . 
 Thanks for the warning , Mom . 
 Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 . 
 Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? 

Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ? 
 Shall I help you with it ? 
 I have much time . I suppose it can be done . 

Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way . 
 Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ? 
 Is it far ? 
 And do you know where the national bank is ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . 
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . 
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
 But I just want to give her some tips . 
 I guess you are right . 
 I hope so . 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . 
 She is beautiful . 
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . 
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . 
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . 

Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ? 
 Look ! The iron is still on . 
 Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it . 
 Never mind , dear . 
 Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
 And must I go back to school ? 
 But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 . 
 What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 

I am so busy today . 
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
 Or maybe make the beds . 
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 

Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 

Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 

OK . Come back into the classroom , class . 
 Yes , but to the heath , this break has last long enough . 
 come on , baby . It ’ s time now . 
 Hurry up , little boy . 
 Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly . Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print . There . 
 Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Oh ... 
 Sorry , love . 
 My cigarettes . 
 In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? 
 Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
 Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
 Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
 It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
 OK . 

Here's the dress you wanted to be made . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 This is a pity ! 
 Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . 
 Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . 
 Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . 
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 
 I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . 
 At the Gate . 
 Round about seven . 
 Peter . Peter Brown , you know . Don't forget to bring the letter . 
 I told you not to forget to bring the letter . 

We'd like to rent a flat near the university . 
 Yes , we are . Obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month . 
 Not really , no . We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street . 
 We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined . 
 How far away is it from the campus ? 
 That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . 
 Thank you . That would be great . 
 Yes , ma'ma . There'll be no problem with the quality . 
 You don't have to worry about it . We have a one year warranty . 
 Sure . We have a good after-sale service . Your satisfaction is guaranteed . 
 It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . 
 Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . 
 Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . 
 How much do you think the rent will be ? 

I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? 
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . 
 Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . 
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 
 Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! 
 Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen . 
 That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . 
 Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . 
 No , we don ’ t . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . 
 It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ? 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . 
 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! 
 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . 
 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . 
 Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . 

Mum , can I finish my homework later ? 
 But I want to watch TV now . 
 Please . 
 Not even for an hour ? 

I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 
 Perhaps I should call her later . 
 Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment . 
 Does he have a moustache or a beard ? 
 Sounds like Mike , is it ? 
 Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are . 
 Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree . 
 She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too . 
 She ’ s your mother ! 
 I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . 
 Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! 
 No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . 
 Meat , I think . 
 I do , but I want meat . 
 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 

You say he was around average hight . 
 Weight ? 
 Any marks on his face ? 
 Glasses ? 
 what about his hair ? 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 
 Boy , this surely doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . 
 Ok , now we are getting some where . Pants ? 
 What kind of shoes ? 
 Cow while Boots . 
 All right . That Nealy done a little . 

There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . 
 I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound . 
 That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 

Yes , sir . May I help you ? 
 For today ? 
 We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ? 
 I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . 
 How about afternoon ? 

Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ? 
 The chicken is also nice . 
 Our special tonight is lobster . 
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb . 
 What ever you say ? 
 Yes ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . 
 Sorry , I'm very near sighted . 
 Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . 
 Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? 
 Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . 
 I will . Thank you , dad . 
 Really , it's so beautiful . 
 You mustn't pick it in this place . 
 It's a private garden . 
 Well , I have got a vacancy . 
 Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry . 
 Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch . 
 Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms . 
 My name's Donald Eakins . 
 It's E-A-K-I-N-S . 
 It's 1446 Pine Street . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer . 
 Furnished . 
 No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . 
 My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ? 

Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ? 
 No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? 
 It says ' Keep off the grass ! ' 
 Be careful . You can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' . 
 Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . 
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 
 It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . 
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 

Good morning , sir . 
 How do you want it , sir ? 
 How about your sideburns ? 
 All right ... Tilt your head to the right , please . 
 Exactly five dollars . 
 You are welcome , sir . Good-bye . 
 Oh , yes , Mrs.Saxton . Please take a seat here . 
 Would you like a shampoo first ? 
 Yeah . A lot of my customers love it . ( after shampooing ) Do you want a permanent wave or a cold wave ? 
 Sure . We just got some . They're upto-date . 
 No problem . 
 No , ma'am , there's only one person ahead of you . You won't have to wait long . 
 All right , madam , it's your turn . What will it be today ? 
 Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable . 
 Would you like me to blow-dry your hair ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ? 

Good morning , sir . 
 Do you have a particular style in mind ? 
 I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . 
 The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? 
 Next Friday . 

I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . 
 I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . 
 Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . 
 Certainly . 

I come to try my new suit . Here's the receipt . 
 Aren't the trousers a little too long ? 
 Very well . Thank you . 

Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? 
 Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . 
 The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ? 
 That's fine , thank you . 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 The Grand Hotel . 
 Yes . Do you know where it is ? 
 It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . 

Where is that ? 
 Are you in a hurry ? 
 We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour . 
 I'll do my best . 
 Do you have small bills ? 
 Here is your receipt . Thank you . 
 Where are you heading now ? 
 Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? 
 You mean we'll share the taxi ? 
 Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . 
 Yes , I'd like to look at some suits . 
 Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel . 
 It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ? 
 It looks good . But can I try it on ? 
 Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ? 
 Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a cap . Size 16 . 
 Yes . It's a bit tight . Have you got a bigger one ? 
 Yes , that's fine . I'll take it . Can I pay by check ? 

What can I do for you , madam ? 
 How about this one ? 
 They're three hundred dollars . 
 OK , This one is one hundred and twenty . It's the cheapest here . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat . 
 I don't know really . What's the fashional color this year ? 
 Good . Red suits me very well . It's a cheerful color , isn't it ? 
 Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . 
 I quite like this one . How much is it ? 
 Oh , that's too expensive . Aren't there any cheaper ones ? 
 Yes , I see . I'll take it . Here's $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? 
 Fine , And what about something to drink ? 
 Good . Thank you.sir . 
 No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I'm looking for a green dress . 
 I wear size 32 . This one looks nice . Where may I try it on ? 
 How does it look ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll take it . 
 Go along this street to the traffic lights . 
 That's right , and turn left at the lights . 
 And then right at the bridge . 
 Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it . 
 Yes ? 
 Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... 
 Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
 Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it . 
 Yes . Why ? 

May I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . 
 Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive . 
 They are $ 168 . 

Good coming . 
 Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished . You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say . It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . 
 It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ? 
 Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . 
 Of course . It's on Memorial Avenue . 
 Right . You know where that is ? 
 Well , do you know where the post office is ? 
 That won't help us . Let me see now ... Why don't you follow this street , Elm , until , you get to the second stoplight . 

Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories ? 
 Oh , yes ! 
 I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
 She's eighty-seven . 
 Thank you . That's a good idea . she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ? 
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 
 Of course . Here you are . 

Excuse me . Could you give me some directions ? 
 A gas station . My car ran out of gas two blocks back . 
 Do you know the name of the street ? 
 By the way , do you know the price of the gas now ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
 Thank you for you help . 
 I need some stamps for this letter . 
 How much do I need for this letter ? 
 I want it registered . How much is it then ? 
 Here's a 10 - dollar bill . 
 Thanks . Good-bye . 
 Yes , where's it to , madam ? 
 You want to send it airmail , madam ? 

Excuse me , I'd like to send this parcel . 
 Just a few shirts . 
 No , I'd rather send it by ordinary mail . 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you so much . 

Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please . 
 Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America . 
 Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take . 
 Do you insure package ? 
 Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ? 
 One last question-what are your hours ? 
 Thank you , you helped me a lot . 
 Sure . How about this one ? 
 Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . 
 The hardcover is more expensive . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Let me give you a hand . The author is ... 
 Oh , yes . Here it is . 
 Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ? 
 It's $ 25 . 

Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? 
 Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? 
 How many stops are there ? 
 Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
 By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ? 
 Thank you . 
 Do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail ? 
 About five weeks . 
 Just a moment . I'll weigh it . 
 Yes , what's in the package , madam ? 
 How would you like to send it ? 
 Do you want to insure it ? 
 3 dollars . 
 Yes . Can you show me the menu , please ? 
 Then , what's special tonight ? 
 All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables . 
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
 I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 

Excuse me . When's the next bus ? 
 Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ? 
 So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ? 
 So when will it be here then ? 
 Never ? 

Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine . How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 

Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
 That doesn't sound too bad . 
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 

where are you going , Jane ? 
 I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . 
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street . 
 It's about a ten-minute walk . 
 Not at all . 
 I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! 
 Banker ? 
 Can I have my $ 200 please ? 

Can you help me find a pan ? 
 I want a big pan . 
 Yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . 
 It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . 
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 
 Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? 

What are you working on ? 
 What budget ? 
 How much money can you spend ? 
 Why only $ 300 ? 
 For what ? 
 Your budget is a good idea . 

Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? 
 What sort of pest are we dealing with ? 
 Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it . Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days . 

Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ? 
 Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? 
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 
 What did you find ? 
 Go and try it on . 
 I love that shirt on you . 
 They don't really fit you right . 
 That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you . 
 That would be a good idea . 
 Let me feel your forehead . I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat . 
 But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet . Here's some seafood rice soup I made . It's delicious . 
 But the last two days were a weekend . 

How can I help you today ? 
 What would you like to return ? 
 Was there something wrong with it ? 
 What isn't working on it ? 
 Alright , do you have the receipt ? 
 I'm going to take care of this and refund your money . 

Help me organize these coins . 
 Yeah , I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first I have to separate them into little piles . 
 Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank . 
 Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound . 
 Hopefully ! 
 No ! 
 Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back . 
 Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral . 
 It's nothing personal , just business . 
 True . I always see him drinking instant . 
 Do you think that will be enough to make him have a change of heart ? 

Johnny , I want to thank you . 
 Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy . 
 I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you . 
 Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all ! 
 No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? 
 That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ? 
 Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol . 
 Your throat must be swollen . 
 Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup . 
 I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . 
 It's a small . 
 It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it . 
 I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you ! 
 What are you doing ? 
 You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! 
 Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? 

Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . 
 Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . 
 I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . 
 Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . 

Ouch ! The water's too hot ! 
 I'm not hungry , Mom . 
 Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? 

Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . 
 The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . 
 That's another one thousand six hundred ? 

You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! 
 That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . 
 Come on baby , let's dance ! 

Sorry to bother you so early . There's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but I thought I'd ask you first . 
 I thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . So why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details . 
 Great . See you then . 
 And this espresso looks like ... oil ! 
 These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it . 

So how long do you plan to live here ? 
 Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ? 
 Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do . 
 That about does it . See you in a week . 
 I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . 
 Sure , for at least three thousand per month . 
 I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . 
 Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water . 
 Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . 
 Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . 
 Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again . 
 As long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , I'll be alright for a while . You got your espresso , Jess ? 
 What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ... 
 Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini . 
 And I'll stick with real coffee . 
 Yeah , time for more coffee ! 
 By the way , I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain . 
 It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ? 
 Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month . 
 That's why I can profit from it ! 
 You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... 

This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . 
 You never know when two might turn into three . 
 Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms . 

Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States . 
 Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! 
 Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it ! 
 And here's her signature ! 
 This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture . 
 This building is only four years old . It was built with central air . 
 And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see . 
 I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator . 
 And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? 
 It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? 

They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other ! 
 Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big . 
 With the shipping included--seventy dollars . 

But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment . 
 Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ? 
 And we could get a dog ! 
 Well , fish it will be then . 
 Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets . 
 Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster . 
 It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it ! 
 Easy for you to say . My bottom still stings . 
 Can't we go to McDonald's first ? 
 No , thanks . 
 Blah ... What's that ? 

Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem . 
 Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home . 
 Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor . 

Morning , Mom . 
 No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor . 
 OK . I'll go see the doctor . 
 Chicken soup again ? 

Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments . 
 Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep . 
 You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best . 
 Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup . 
 And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again . 
 Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine ! 
 I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . 
 I'm doing my best , Grandma ... 
 Uh-oh , here we go ... 
 I know , Grandma , I just ... 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes'm . 
 It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . 
 I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes ! 
 Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now . 

I think I found my Yankee's mug ... 
 It fell out of the garbage bag . 
 It was with all the other dishes from dinner . 
 I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . 
 Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? 
 Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ... 

Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! 
 What time is it anyway ? 
 Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! 
 OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ... 
 No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . 
 Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here . 
 I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us . 
 I think she just likes to make us miserable . 

So can we play PlayStation later ? 
 All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ? 
 Right on . I'm gonna get a new game ! 
 I knew there would be a catch ! 
 Except housework , that is . 
 It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try . 
 Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . 
 There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it . 
 Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . 
 They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . 

Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! 
 I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! 
 I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! 
 Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . 

Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . 
 Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? 
 Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . 
 That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . 
 That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . 
 No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . 

Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ? 
 I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . 
 Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 

Hi , I would like to return this TV . 
 Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard . 
 The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . 
 I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . 
 Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . 
 “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” 
 Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! 
 No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei . 
 Sure ! What do you feel like having ? 
 Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? 
 I'm not , I am a vegan . 
 A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . 
 It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . 
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 
 Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . 
 Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ... 
 Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? 
 Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming ! 
 ... I know I'll be killed if I pee on the toilet seat . 

Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old . 
 Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint . 
 This is one of my favorite items . 

How much for these autographed Elvis records ? 
 Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ? 
 I don't really need five . 
 Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em . 
 You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ? 
 Me , too . But I could never make bracelets like these . 
 I'll take one right now for seven dollars . 

Why didn't you text me last night ? 
 I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message . 
 Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . 
 I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . 

Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ? 
 Certainly sir , For which day and time please ? 
 I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight . 
 Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ? 
 Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ? 

I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat . 
 I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae . 
 Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind . 
 How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet , let's order some hot dogs ! 

OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? 
 OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . 
 No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . 
 Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . 
 Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . 
 We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . 

Hey honey ! Where were you ? 
 How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? 
 Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . 
 You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! 
 Leftovers . 
 From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! 
 Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . 
 Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! 
 Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . 
 I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . 
 Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? 
 Oh yes , I ... 
 Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread . 
 No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ? 
 Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ? 
 I'll just take a cheesecake . 
 Yes . 

Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . 
 Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . 
 Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . 
 That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ? 
 Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? 
 What about here in physical education ? 
 So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! 
 Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . 
 Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! 
 Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . 
 Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! 
 Want some more ? 

What are you doing this weekend ? 
 Is it a family thing or just friends ? 
 Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny . 
 You mean your sister ? 
 You lost me . 

Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? 
 Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots . 
 Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . 
 We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . 
 Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? 
 I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! 
 Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! 
 Good idea ! 
 What ? Why ? 
 Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . 
 I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . 
 Good luck with that ! 
 Here you go . 
 Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? 
 What's my other option ? 
 That's fine . I'll do that then . 

What's wrong ? 
 You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . 
 They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . 
 The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . 
 This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . 
 This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . 

Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . 
 OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? 
 Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . 
 No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . 
 Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . 
 That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . 
 It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . 
 Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . 
 Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . 

Whoa ! This is a massive flea market ! 
 And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff . 
 You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan . 

You want to go get a facial with me today ? 
 Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . 
 Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . 
 Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . 

Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain ! 
 But you could have saved money . 
 F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ... 

Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ? 
 Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble ! 
 That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ? 
 Sounds like you are really getting in shape ! 
 Are you looking for anything else ? 
 That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want . 
 And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them . 

Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? 
 That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . 
 Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . 
 Is fifteen dollars OK ? 
 Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . 
 What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ? 
 Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ? 
 Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA . 
 OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . 
 Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! 
 They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem . 
 It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive . 
 No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too . 
 He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ... 
 Nice to meet you . I'm Wen , and this is Nikki . 
 She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on . 

Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . 
 Show me some classic high heels , please . 
 Black . Classic . 
 Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . 
 I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for . 
 Seven-and-a-half . 
 Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time . 

I am really interested in buying this television . 
 How much are you selling it for ? 
 You can't be serious . 
 That's too expensive for me . 
 You can't go down on the price . 
 I'll buy it for $ 2000 . 

I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! 
 On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . 
 Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . 
 You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . 
 I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! 

I'm planning on going to the market soon . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I'll make a list . 
 Okay , do we need any meat ? 
 What else do we need ? 

What can I help you with today ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like . 
 How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you ? 
 Alright , so I'll see you then ? 

Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Nice ! Brunch ! 
 Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
 Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 

Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! 
 Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . 
 Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! 

Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! 
 Great ! I ’ ll take it . 
 I understand . Thank you very much ! 

I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat . 
 Will you take long ? 
 Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! 
 Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
 Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 
 Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? 
 I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . 
 They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . 
 Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
 It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
 Is that better ? 
 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 

Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals . 
 Please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , I am sure we could find something that interests you ! 
 We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world ! 
 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 
 You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters ! 
 Well , I also have ... 
 Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
 I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! 
 Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
 Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
 Yay ! 
 No problem . How many are you thinking about ? 
 If you'll just fill out this form , please . 
 We can do that very easily . 
 Great . Your order will take only one week . 
 We can do that . It'll just cost you extra . 
 It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
 Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . 
 Not funny . 
 I'm just shopping . 
 Some new clothes . How about you ? 
 Have you found anything nice yet ? 
 Where'd you get those ? 
 Those are really cute . 
 I would like that . Thank you . 
 You might want to try the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . 
 Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . 
 Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . 
 Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet . 
 Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat . 
 These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . 
 No , thank you . 
 That would be great . 
 I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ? 
 I need it delivered at 12 o'clock . 
 That's not a problem ? 
 That's great ! Thank you very much . 
 Well , I think you'll like the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it . 
 No . You would break all your teeth on it . 
 The sale price today is $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside . 
 They come from tropical countries . 
 No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 
 I see . What else ? 
 Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 

Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ? 
 What exactly are mangoes ? 
 Is the seed edible ? 
 How much does a mango cost ? 
 Maybe I won't like the taste . 
 How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ? 
 Where do most of them come from ? 

I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . 
 Mangoes . What are they ? 
 Can you eat the nut ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What does a mango taste like ? 
 How do I know if it's ripe ? 
 Where do they come from ? 

Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 Mangoes ? What are mangoes ? 
 Can you eat the seed ? 
 Well , how much are they ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 Where do they grow mangoes ? 

I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen . 
 I've already got a small pan . I need a big one . 
 Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me . 
 Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle . 
 Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Cash . But first , I need a lid for this pan . 

Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in . 
 Perfect ! I like this one . 
 Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ? 
 That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 
 Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ? 
 Great ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 What are you getting ? 
 Don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it . 
 I ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter . 

Telco Mobile , how can I help you ? 
 Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling .

 I need help finding a new refrigerator . 
 That Kenmore looks nice . 
 What makes is so great ? 
 What appliances are you talking about ? 
 May I take a look inside ? 
 It's very nice . I'd like to purchase this refrigerator . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class . 
 Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have someone to help me out , though . 
 Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while . 
 Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp . 
 Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool . 
 Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties . 

What can I do for you today ? 
 Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ? 
 This particular refrigerator is a very good choice . 
 Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances . 
 It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside . 
 Go right ahead . 

Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? 
 That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? 
 That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . 
 Thanks John , and there you have it ! Looks like it ’ s a weekend to stay at home ! 
 Where are you planning on looking for one ? 
 I can tell you where I got mine . 
 IKEA has beautiful furniture . 
 The furniture cost a couple thousand dollars . 
 It's very sturdy . You get what you pay for . 
 I assure you that you're paying for quality . 
 Where are you going to buy one ? 
 You like my living room set , don't you ? 
 I found mine at IKEA . 
 Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand . 
 The furniture isn't built cheap . 
 You will feel comfortable paying the money . 
 I would like to buy a new fridge . 
 I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 What appliances ? 
 May I see the inside for myself ? 
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 
 We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many . 
 Here's a form to get you started . 
 I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card . 
 Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please . 
 If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem . 
 Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . 
 No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal . 

I need to find a new furniture set for my living room . 
 I have no idea . 
 Where'd you get it from ? 
 How much did it cost you ? 
 Is the furniture sturdy ? 
 I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good . 

Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? 
 We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . 
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . 

I need to get some business cards printed up . 
 I think I can get by with 2,000 . 
 I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards . 
 ... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card . 
 Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven . 

Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . 
 Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . 
 Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
 When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! 
 Do you have any idea how many you'd like ? 
 Would you fill out this form , please ? 
 If you detect any difference , I'll take you out to dinner . 
 Thank you . Your order will be ready seven days from now . 
 We can certainly give you faster turn around , but it will cost you extra . 
 Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . 
 Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . 
 What about Wi-fi ? 
 One last thing . Is it waterproof ? 
 It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while . He ’ s in a bit of a jam . 
 Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . 
 Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . 
 Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . 
 Not in a million years ! 
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . 
 Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . 
 I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . 
 It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . 
 I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? 
 I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! 
 Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . 

Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? 
 It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? 
 Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . 
 No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . 

Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ? 
 Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps . 
 Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! 
 Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! 

What are you doing ? 
 You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd ! 
 I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ? 
 Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ? 
 Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online ? 
 Let ’ s do it ! 
 Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package , too . 
 Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? 
 Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online . 

I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . 
 Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . 
 What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . 
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 

Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? 
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 
 Have you treated any real emergencies ? 
 I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! 
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! 
 What does that mean ? 
 Me ! Me ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! 
 Well , OK . But no French kissing ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! 
 I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! 
 What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
 Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ? 
 Look at this one . It's our biggest pan . 
 Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum . 
 Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . 
 That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? 
 I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is . 
 Is there any particular size that you want ? 
 What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 " pan . 
 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan . 
 I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ? 
 Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit . 
 Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . 
 You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays . 

I'm searching for an old music box . 
 If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . 
 Would any of them have dancing figures ? 
 Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . 
 One last question 
 I guess I was asking for too much . 

Car trouble center . How may I help you ? 
 Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . 
 OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? 
 Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? 
 No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . 
 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 

OK darling , I got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! 
 Humph ! Right , so what did you get ? 
 Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ? 
 Oh , so organic vegetables are the ‘ green ’ option , right ? 
 Wait a minute , what's that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? 

How about this floor lamp ? 
 We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . 
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 
 Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! 
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . 
 While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . 

Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? 
 Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . 
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives . 
 Never mind that . Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki . If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles . 
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 
 Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! 
 This next one is from Betty . 
 One more from Carla . 
 OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? 

Check out these wheels ! 
 No , I borrowed it . 
 You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me ... 

I want a refund ! 
 These pajamas don't fit right . They're too long . 
 No . I want my money back . 
 Fine . Here's my receipt . I'd better be able to use this anywhere in the store . 

I'm sorry , sir . I'm going to have to ask you to leave . 
 Well , she apparently doesn't think it's so friendly . Let's go . 
 You'd better cooperate with me , sir , or ... 

Actually , you can take advantage of our " New Millennium Woman " promotion . 
 Yes . If your " Love , Amy " purchases amount to 10,000 NT or more , you get a V . I . P . card and a 20 percent discount . 
 OK . Just think for a bit . I'll go help another customer . I'll be right back . 
 Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . 
 I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! 
 You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... 

Ahhs ! I'm beat ! 
 I just got back from fighting the crowds . 
 Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... 
 Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... 
 I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . 
 I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
 Sure . What's up ? 
 Oh , this's easy . You can take the subway to 34 street . You'll see it as you get out . 

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . 
 Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . 

Do you really like this straw hat , dear ? 
 But it costs an arm and leg . 

I'd like to see a tea set , please ? 
 They're OK , but I prefer chinese ones . 

I'm starving . Let's get something to eat . 
 Sure . What kind of food do you like ? 
 How about some Korean food ? There's a place right there on the corner . 

I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ? 
 And they're very dear , too . 
 Oh , that's ideal . 
 I'm sorry.My car's taken . 
 Not far away.It ' s over there . 
 Here you are.That comes to 120 yuan . 
 Certainly , sir.Would you sign here , please ? ... Thank you . 
 Not yet . 
 A trim and perm . 
 A cold-wave , please . 
 Sure.Step in . 
 No.But it's a bit strange today . 
 Is it my turn ? 
 Not too long.Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too . 

The dinner is really rich . 
 I like the soy sauce chicken . 

It's your turn , sir.Sorry to keep you waiting . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 
 How about the sides ? 

Show me the photos of the latest hair styles , will you ? 
 This one will suit me best.What do you think ? 
 No , thank you . 
 No , nothing of the kind . 
 No , I'm used to having tea first . 
 No sugar , please . 
 Would you like it rare , medium or well-done ? 

Which do you prefer , sour peppery soup or four-jewel soup ? 
 Then we'll have four-jewel soup . 
 I like the new shirt . 
 Oh , I prefer it loose 
 Yes . 
 An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry . 
 OK . 
 Sure.It ' s just right . 
 No ! It's a perfect fit ! 
 Linen.It ' s ideal for summer wear . 
 Certainly.It has been specially treated . 
 Certainly.here you are . 
 Very smart ! 
 Let me see.Oh , we have the design but not the same color as this one . 
 You're welcome . 
 It's about two or there blocks away from here . 
 It'll take you about 15 minutes . 
 It's on the Fifth Avenue . 
 I see.You ' re a stranger here.Walk two blocks ahead , then turn left . You can't miss it . 
 Yes , it's straight ahead around the corner . 

May I borrow your typewriter ? 
 Until the end of the week . 

Dad , can you lend me some money ? 
 I want to get a ticket for a concert tonight . 

Come on.Plenty of room upstairs.Fares please ! 
 One dollar ... I'm short of change this morning . 
 Good , here's your ticket and four dollars change . 

I wonder whether I could possibly borrow your new bicycle now . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'd really like to help you out , but I am broke myself . 

Can you direct me to Holiday inn ? 
 Thanks . 
 I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 

How much is a ticket to Edinburgh ?

 How far is that ? 

Have you ever shopped online ? 
 Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try . 
 What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ? 
 It is so nice of you . 
 Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card . 
 Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . 
 Er ... Hum ... Got it . 
 Right ! 
 I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
 I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ? 
 Sorry , my English isn ’ t so good . Could you speak a little slower ? 
 Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . 
 Right ? OK , got it . 
 Next left then right ? OK . 
 Absolutely . Mm , this is really good . 
 I'd love to . 
 No , sir . Where to ? 
 OK . Please step in . I know where it is .

 Yeas , It is . Sewen Jes speaking . How can I help ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir . What exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , dear ! I'll do whatever I can . 
 It's nice , but still too expensive . Can you give me a 20 % discount ? 
 Come on . Let's split the difference , 15 % . 
 Sure , what time will you like to depart ? 
 Actually , one just left ten minutes ago . The next one is at two forty-five , debates at five thirty-five . 
 Sure , that will be thirty-two dollars please .

Excuse me . Do you have this in blue ? 
 And sorry . I can't find the price . How much is it ? 
 OK . Do you have it in extra small ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Sure . Any particular model ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular . 
 Yes . But not for about 2 weeks . 
 Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way . 
 Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ? 
 Well.It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though . 
 Can you break a 100 dollar bill ? 
 No , I'm sorry . That's all I have . Unless you take a credit card . 

Excuse me . How much for one are these ? 
 OK . Say I was to buy four , could I get a discount ? 
 Oh , I was hoping to get one free . Like four for 75 dollars . 

Excuse me . I bought the CD here two days ago . It's scratched , and doesn't play properly . 
 The thing is I've replaced once already . I think it's just a faulty batch . 
 Well . To be honest , that's not much use to me . I'll leave the country tomorrow . I'd really prefer a refund . 

Hello , sir . Is there anything I can help you find ? 
 Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ... 
 Well , if you need anything , just ask . 
 It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator . 

I'm sorry to make you wait . What did you decide ? 
 Trust me , it's worth it . With the " Love , Amy Card " , you'll get a 20 percent discount on everything in the store , every time you shop ! 
 Yes ! And there are more bargains . See these pajamas ? If you buy a pair now , you get this teddy bear as a gift ! 

Excuse me , but I'm looking for a gift for my friend . 
 Well , it's a wedding gift . 
 Basically . But I have no idea what to get ! She's American and kind of ... 

So that will be one teddy , two terry cloth robes , three pairs of satin slippers , and two pairs of pajamas . 
 Let me see ... yes , 15,880 NT . After the discount , your total comes to 12,704 NT . Here's your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application . 
 Right here . And write your address . You'll get the card in the mail within a week . 
 I know your friend will like the gift set , especially the teddy bear . 
 Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges . There are no refunds on sale items . 
 They're going skiing in Colorado . 
 You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . 
 I'll give you the boxes . You can then go to our gift-wrapping department . 
 It's on the first floor , to the right of the main entrance . 
 Have a nice holiday ! 

Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ? 
 He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him . 
 Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . 
 Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security . 
 Don't get all worked up over him . He's probably harmless . 
 You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ... 
 OK ! I'll call security . 
 Are there many accidents in the city every day ? 
 Please drive slowly , we've got lots of time . Safety first . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ? 
 And he can move , too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! 
 Actually , I don't think I can eat another bite ! 
 Actually , I think we want to pay our bill . 

Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! 
 He sounds like a sick cow ! 
 I already tried that . Nothing seems to help . 

Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song . 
 You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ? 
 Then , is the machine broken or ... 
 I have a question . 
 Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ? 
 I'm just curious . I think women are beautiful without this stuff . 

Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! 
 Wow ! What's that ? 
 It's so small that I didn't notice it . 

Here ! Here ! Use my card ! 
 Not on my life ! I'm the best man , so I pay ! 
 What's that ? 
 You've got it ! But are we coming back for the music , or for the fruit ? ! 
 That means they have tapered legs . 
 Mine are , too . 
 Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! 
 OK ... just grab it right out of my hands ... 
 That piece fits on to your ear . It hooks right on . And you just put the other one in your other ear . 

So what did you get ? 
 What's this ? Essential oil ? Wow ! This stuff is expensive . 
 How is oil supposed to make you relax ? 
 Mmmm . They smell nice . 
 Cool ! They're big ! What have you got in there ? 
 Are you planning a trip to the Outback ? 
 Well , my pants are very slimming . They're capris . 
 I thought you were supposed to put them in some kind of burner with a candle ... 
 So what's your illness ... shopping fever , sale-itis ? 
 What's tomorrow ? 

Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
 Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! 
 What for ? 
 Now what are you doing ? 
 Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . 
 And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . 
 Yep . There's still so much to do ! 
 Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ? 
 Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us ! 

My mascara's waterproof ! 
 No . There's makeup remover for waterproof mascara . 
 Yep . See how long and curly my lashes are ? 
 Thanks ! 
 I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ? 
 OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ? 
 Great . She'll be so happy . 
 Can't it wait ? She's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations . 
 I know . And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas ! 
 OK . 
 Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... 
 It's a cute little teddy bear ! 
 And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card . 

Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 
 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... 
 Maybe ... 
 It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 
 Then I bet he's really good ! 

So your mom can stop nagging you now . 
 Don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune-teller again . 
 The day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day . 

This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable , I think I could fall asleep ! 
 I'll have whatever you're having . 
 Well ... the beer sounds good ! 
 Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist ! 
 You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ... 

Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ... 
 " Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree " ? ! Where did you learn that song ? 
 I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! 
 Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! 
 Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... 

Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you . 
 I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity ! 
 Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off . 
 Enjoy your food ! Bye ! 
 Do I have a choice ? You said the guy who was supposed to do it didn't show . 
 Just come over here , sir . First you need to sign in and get your photo nametag . 
 Would you like to donate to our alumni fund ? 
 You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive ! 
 No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ? 
 A risk I would never take ... 

Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go ! 
 Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win ! 
 Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be . 

Holly ? Holly Madison , is that you ? You look great ! You haven't changed a bit . 
 It's me . The D-man ! I sat behind you in English . Are you and Taylor still dating ? 
 Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ... 

Ten dollars ? Maybe there are a lot of them ... 
 Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ? 
 Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely . 

Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it . 
 But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! 
 Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket . 
 Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ? 
 Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . 
 The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient . 
 Or discuss what gifts they could buy together . 
 We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . 
 Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? 

I decided to give it a go ! 
 A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets ! 
 Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty ! 
 Well , there was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy . ” 

But what if I don't win what I bid on ? 
 It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions . 
 And people are honest ? 

I was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to Taiwan . 
 I understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but I am willing to pay extra for shipping . 
 Thanks so much ! By the way , is the racket really Serena Williams ’ ? 

Brooke , I have bad news . 
 I called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today . 
 I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . 
 They said that they did . I've been so busy ... 
 I didn't think there would be a problem . 
 I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me . 
 Brooke ! 
 Most of it is . You should sign up . 
 Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai ? They are very safe . 
 That's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is . 

Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ? 
 No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? 
 You're not coming ? 
 I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . 
 We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . 
 Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas . 
 I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best . 

How much are you planning to buy ? 
 Cool ! Can I come ? 
 But not enough space for me ? 
 Billy ... 
 The aroma of roasting coffee beans . 
 Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . 
 This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... 

Cute ... Here . These beans are already ground . Now for step three 
 You have to brew the grinds while they're fresh and drink it immediately for the best flavor . 
 There is no step four ... 

It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! 
 You mean half-and-half ? 
 Good idea . 

This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 
 Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! 
 You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! 

Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ? 
 Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ? 
 Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy ! 
 Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too ! 
 Are they from Taiwan ? 
 OK . I'll take four kiwis . 
 Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin . 
 You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT . 
 I'll have my brother cut some for you . 
 That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon ! 
 Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life ! 
 Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ? 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 
 Cool ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 

Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ? 
 So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ? 
 I thought homecoming was a high school dance . 

Good Morning , Mrs . Schmidt ! I see you're standing on your head again . 
 I have to finish preparing a paper for my Western Civilization class . 
 Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me . 
 I have no idea what I'm doing . 
 Whoa ! We're changing partners now ? Where do I go ? 
 Whoa ! Oh , no ! 

I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . 
 That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . 
 Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class . 

So people can go and root for their old school team ? 
 You don't sound too excited about going to your reunion . 
 Are you nervous about meeting up with your ex , Femi ? 

Who finances the magazine ? 
 Does it have a large circulation ? 

What do you want , Essie ? 
 I don't want coffee . I'd like some orange juice . 
 I don't like coffee in this cafe . 
 Most people think so . 
 Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop . 
 Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital . 
 Not at all . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Let me see . Did you change anything on your computer ? 
 What kind of anti-virus software do you use ? 
 Are you riding ? You have to install an anti-virus software on your computer . If not , you will be attacked by viruses , and it can lead your computer into failure . 
 Morning . What would you like for breakfast ? 
 Come on . We are going to be late . 
 Milk ? 

What in the world is that smell ? 
 Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? 
 Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? 
 The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! 
 Yes , but don't cut them yet . Wait until they cool . Where is the big plastic bowl ? 
 What's Donna like , by the way ? 
 Oh , Paul is very easy-going and friendly . 
 Yes , sure . Which cupboard is it in ? 
 There is no pepper here . 

A woman after my own heart ... 
 Well , step two is grinding the coffee beans . I've roasted three different types of beans . 
 Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ? 

Excuse me , are there any more shopping carts ? 
 But there isn't a single one right now . 
 thank you , I'll wait here . 
 Thanks a lot . By the way , do you make the deliveries ? 
 Is it free of charge ? 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , sir . Just hold the line , please . Now the line is connected . Go ahead please . 

Hello . I am calling about the apartment you advertised . 
 I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ? 
 Sometime around next week . What can you tell me about this apartment ? 
 Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ? 
 How about 10 am ? 
 My name is Blanca . 

Will you bring our bill , please ? 
 Thanks . Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here . Would you mind checking , please ? 
 How about taxes service charge ? 
 Then 100 US dollars covers everything , doesn't it ? 

You'll love this . It's a chick drink . 
 Well , that too . I mean that it's kind of sweet . See if you can guess what's in it . 
 Not bad . You really know your booze ... So I guess you know what's in the salsa , too ? 
 Don't tell me you're a salsa expert , too ! 
 I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa . 
 And they have tangy , freshly-made salsa , too . My mouth is watering already ! 
 Surprise me . 
 Yes , you do . The Hot Cap is back here in the corner . I think we're ready to put the curlers in . What kind of perm would you like ? 
 All right . What if we leave your bangs straight and just perm the sides and back ? 
 Around 30 minutes . 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . 
 Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . 
 Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . 
 Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . 
 I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . 
 No problem ! 
 Yes , they are . 
 I want to use these coupons . Have they expired ? 
 Yes , could you use plastic bags ? 
 Could you charge it to my credit card ? 
 Here you are . 
 Sure . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , it's a bit overweight . You must pay extra for it . 
 We demand a surcharge of 80 cents for it . 
 Hello , this is John . I wanna speak to Linda , please .

 Ann , this is Sam . Look , Ann . I wanna see you again . How about a drink tonight ? 
 What about tomorrow evening ? 
 But Ann .. 
 I'll see if she is in . 
 I'm afraid she's out . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sure . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 May I help you ? 
 Let me weight it first . That'll be 14 dollars . 
 Of course , it's 4 dollars now . 
 No , you don't . We use computers now . 
 In a month .

 Centrum ? We have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets . Which kind do you want ? 
 And what kind of toothbrushes would you like ? 
 Sure . This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium . 
 This one is 10 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes . 
 That's right . 
 And here is your aspirin . What else did you say you want ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Sure . Here you are . This one is excellent . Just mix one drop of it with milk . 

Excuse me , I got a parcel arrival notice yesterday . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , here is my ID card . 
 Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ’ ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes another 10 to 15 minutes , I ’ m afraid . 
 I see . 
 Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once . 

Take me to this address , please . 
 How much do I owe you , sir ? 
 Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ? 
 I don't get it . I'll go and have our doorman talk to you then . 

You are from Japan , aren't you ? 
 I love Japan a lot . 
 Let's go to another place where my friend is working , let me pay here . 
 Oh , I must be going now ; it was nice talking with you . 
 500 US dollars . 
 You had champagne for the girl . 
 Yes , thank you very much . 
 Oh , is it ? 
 Yes , certainly , you have the receipt ? 
 Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock , we'll replace it . 

Excuse me . We ordered too much . May we take the food home ? 
 Do I have to pay extra charge for that ? 
 Well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ? 
 Thanks . Would you give me another favor ? 
 Some more Chinese tea for us , please . 

Hello , I bought a China dress in your shop this morning . 
 I bought one size up by mistake . 
 I wonder if you can change it to one size down . 
 Then I ’ ll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ? 

I will have sole then . 
 The rest of us will have this today's special , please . 
 I am sorry but I ordered sole not the same as the others . Will you change it ? 
 Then I'll have the pork cutlet instead . 

Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way . 
 Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here . 
 I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ? 
 Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . 
 You are welcome . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll have a beer please 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Are you sure ? Then I'd love more beer please 
 Are you finished ? 
 Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute . 
 May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? 

Hi , could we have two orange juice smoothies ? 
 Sure , why not ? 
 Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ? 

That is the most boring , typical gift in the world ! 
 That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain . 
 The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though ... 
 A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! 
 Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors . 
 Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive . 
 Right . Hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock . 
 My pleasure . Release the parking brake , and we're almost ready to go . 
 OK . Relax . This car is an automatic , so you don't have to worry about a clutch . 

And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside . 
 My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan . 
 Model it for me . 
 Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert ! 
 Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas . 
 First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive . 
 R is for reverse , P is for park , and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow , or up a steep hill . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . 
 I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once . 
 Pardon me , Miss . But didn't you order chicken soup ? 
 I believe so . But if it really bothers you , I'll replace it for you . 
 Sorry . I'm afraid we can't . But you may order something else instead . 
 Okay , Miss . 
 I hope you enjoy your dinner . 
 I am . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Don't make it too short . I just want a trim . 
 Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ? 
 Here is 4 dollars , keep the change . 

Good evening , do you have a reservation ? 
 Let me see . Ok , this way , please . 
 And would you like to order now ? 
 Here is the menu . 

Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 You have a choice of vegetables , green peas , lima beans or spinach . 
 Yes , sir . What would you want to drink , coffee , tea or milk ? 
 The cream and sugar are on the table , sir . 
 Would you like to order some dessert ? 
 Ice cream , fresh fruit or chocolate cake . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Here you are , sir . Pay the cashier at the door . 
 We serve excellent Chinese food . Which style do you prefer ? 
 It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food , Shandong food , Sichuan food etc . 
 Yes , Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy . 
 Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot . They taste differently . 
 I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious . We have a Sichuan food dining room . May I suggest you to go there ? It's on the third floor . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 That's over on Callaway Street , isn't it ? 
 Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there . 
 Not at all . 
 No , we don't . 
 Just two people . 
 We prefer non-smoking section . 
 How long a wait do you think there ’ ll be ? 
 Ok , we'll wait a while . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I think I'd like to have a tomato sausage soup first . And the same for him , please . 
 One goblet of red wine and one bottle of beer please . 
 What special kind of desserts do you have ? 
 Well , I think we will order after we finish the main course . 

Have you finished ? 
 Would you like some of coffee ? 
 Yes sir , one moment please . here is the check . 
 Here is the change . 
 Thank you very much sir . 
 Is he all right ? There's a big hospital just around the corner . 
 All right , sir . I'll have someone to take you there . By the way , is he insured ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . In case he's not insured , the hospital will never accepts any patient . 
 My hair is kind of dry and brittle ... 
 No , it's just perfect . 
 No , really , it feels great . 

Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer . 
 That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red . 
 All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today . 
 OK . 
 Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! 
 So ? 
 You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ... 
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 

Oh ! My mouth is on fire ! 
 I need more water ! 
 It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! 

Hi , Andy . I am going to Isabel ’ s . Are you coming ? 
 That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? 
 All right , but hurry up . It takes you hours to change . 
 I think so . They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing . 
 She already bought that evening gown . 
 Yesterday . She wore that gown last night , and showed it off to everybody at Mr . Mile ’ s party . 
 Hurry up , will you ? We ’ ll have to go to the gas station first . 

Did you find everything ok today ? 
 Yes . But you must return it within 30 days . 
 There will be no charge at all . However you must show us the receipt . Could you sign it here , please ? 
 All right . Keep you receipt . If something comes up , you can show it to us and we will give you a refund . 

Hey , Jim . Wake up ! 
 You'd better get up or you'll be late . 
 Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago . 
 Rise and shine , sleepyhead . 

Hi , can I help you ? 
 All right . If you need any help , just let me know . My name is Greg . 
 Did you find something you like ? 
 You are right . This is very good brand . It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty , so you don't have to worry about its quality . 
 Unfortunately , it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June . 

Hi , are you being helped ? 
 All our scarves are in this section . What do you think of this one here ? It's made of silk . 
 Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarves . How about this one ? 
 It's 75 dollars plus tax . 
 Since you like it so much , how about a 10 % discount ? That's the best I can offer . 
 Sure . Is there anything else I can get for you ? 

Are you through with your meal ? 
 Here is your check , 86 dollars in all . Can I take care of it here when you are ready ? 
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . 
 I'll be right back . 
 I see . I'll bring some to-go boxes for you . 

I've got to get dad a Father's Day gift . 
 This year I'm going to get him a gag gift . 
 Well , we have a tradition in my family ... 
 No , ties . And there's a tie store . Let's go ! 
 200 bucks . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , I guess I really did get ripped off . 
 Well , I am looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee . 
 Really ? What's that ? 
 I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ? 
 I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this . 
 I don't think the green one fits her complexion . Do you have any skirts in light color or tan ? 
 Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ’ s check ? 

Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel . 
 Every thing for winter is 20 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section . 
 You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to the right . 
 It's ok . 
 They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ... 
 But that way you're not savoring it . 
 Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone ! 
 I don't know ! Can I park my car now ? 
 Fine ! I'll be back by nine then . Don't worry . 
 Finally ! 

Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater . 
 No wonder you brought such a big bag today . 
 Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating ! 

I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some popcorn and Coke . 
 What are you talking about ? We always eat the stuff here . 
 But what's a movie without munchies ? 

Oh , no ! My stub ! I can't believe it — I flushed it down the toilet ! 
 But , but ... it was really an emergency ! And , my stub ... 
 Ah , umm , kind of . 
 Well , I , umm , I flushed it ... 
 No , but this is an emergency ! Please ! 
 OK , OK , fine ! Just open the gate ! 
 Thank god ! A car's leaving . It's my turn ! 
 What concoction are you making ? 
 Awesome ! I'm in heaven . Let me help . They're so easy . 
 And then you just pour the batter into the waffle iron ... 
 Nothing but the best , Cinnamon toast . 
 Why the drama ? Have you been watching soap operas ? 
 Brings back memories ? 
 How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ... 
 Isn't the shape cool ? 
 Hey ! What's that smell ? Are you burning the toast ? 
 Books in the first aisle are all best sellers . 
 Well , do you like novels ? 
 Here is one written by famous Japanese novelist . You can have a look . 
 My pleasure . 
 I'd like two kilos of eggs . 
 Do you have the eggs with the red yolk ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh , My God ! That's terrible . 
 Then give me the ordinary ones . 
 Yes , I want to buy some grapes . 
 People say grapes from XinJiang are much sweeter than other kinds . Please give me a kilo of that . 
 Make sure they are fresh . 

I'd like to buy a fridge . What about the quality of higher products ? 
 Is there a warranty ? 
 How long is it ? 
 Which model is the best seller of this year ? 
 It's too big for me . Could you recommend something else ? 

What can I do for you , Miss ? 
 Well , here is a perfume kind for women . 
 How about this Isawell's flowery perfume ? 
 Do you have green tea perfume ? 
 May I have a look at this ? 
 I like this fragrance . 
 150 yuan . 

Could you introduce some whitening products for me ? 
 Then what kind of product can fade freckles ? 
 How much is it ? 
 It is too expensive for me . Do you have something cheaper ? 

Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Do you know what color your wife often wears ? 
 Would you like this color or other colors ? 
 Then how do you like this plum red one ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Of course . 
 It ’ s too loud . 
 Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me . 
 I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight . 
 Quiet color . 
 Really ? Let ’ s go there . 
 May I take your size ? 
 No problem . 
 About a week . 
 20 yuan for a skirt . 
 Certainly.How do you like to have it made ? 
 You may rest assured . 
 By the end of next week . 

I'd like to get my laundry . 
 Here you are . 
 Can you sew on these buttons ? 
 How much for the shirts ? 
 Here's the money , keep the change . 

I'd like to have this shirt washed and ironed . 
 Yes , heavy starch in the collar please . 
 I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . 
 Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit . 
 Well , the color is all right . But it looks outdated.Can you show me that one ? 
 Really ? 

Can I help you , Madam ? 
 These are all the latest fashion . How do you like this white turtleneck one ? 
 We also have it in grey . 
 It's my pleasure . I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well . 

This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? 
 Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed . 
 No starch . 
 It's almost ready . Can you set the table ? 
 Want to taste this dish ? 
 Really ? 
 If you like to help me do the dishes , I'll be more dreadful . 

Excellent Cleaner ’ s.May I help you ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 I remember your name . Wait for a moment , please . I ’ ll check it for you . Is this black one yours ? 
 I see . Is this yours ? 
 It ’ s ready to go . 

Ahhs ! I'm beat ! 
 I just got back from fighting the crowds . 
 Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... 
 Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... 
 Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist ! 
 You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ... ? 

That looks graceful on you . 
 How about this brown one ? 
 Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are . 
 Sorry , it had been sold out . 

Hello , sir . Is there anything I can help you find ? 
 Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ? 
 Well , if you need anything , just ask . 
 It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator . 
 Don't you have one like this in blue ? 
 Do you need every color in the rainbow ? 
 Ze ze ze ... Women ! 
 Yes.Do you have football stockings here ? 
 OK , I'll buy two pairs of each color.And do you have sports socks ? 
 OK , give me two pairs in white . 
 No.That ' s all . 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 
 OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 

Can I help you ? 
 Well , we have all kinds of sports shoes.Could you tell me what kind of sport you usually do ? 
 OK , then you can buy a pair of jogging shoes.Here are jogging shoes.Which pair do you like best ? 
 Here you are.You can try them on . 

Have you ever shopped online ? 
 Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try . 
 What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ? 
 It is so nice of you . 
 Oh , are the connections correct ? 
 Let me see . Look ! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency . 
 Can it work now ? 
 So what's the problem ? Maybe there is something wrong with the disk . 
 Give it to me . 
 Uh , the movie of Tom Hanks . I know why it can't play . This is a DVD disk . 
 I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there . 
 Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . 
 How much do are you looking to spend ? 
 Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . 
 Anything you need to have in the place ? 
 You can also check out university bulletin boards . 
 Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . 
 Good luck . 
 I'm looking for an MP - 3 player . Which brand is of the highest quality ? 
 Which model is the best-seller ? 
 May I have a look at it ? 
 Do you have this model in white ? 
 Then I'll take the yellow one . 
 Okay . 
 For you , I would recommend this one here . 
 This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school . 
 This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . 
 Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . 
 Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . 
 There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . 
 Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . 
 Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan . 
 You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen . 
 You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system . 
 No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops . 
 Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card . 
 Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . 
 Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . 
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 

Want to send out for some Chinese ? 
 Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . 
 Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like . 
 Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can ’ t finish what I ’ Ve ordered . 
 Don ’ t worry . We ’ ll just get a doggie bag . 
 Yes , sir . How may I be of service ? 
 Certainly . The customer is always right , we are here to serve you . Is there a reason that you would like to return it ? Did you have problems with our product or services ? 
 Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size . 
 Sure , no problem . Do you happen to have the receipt ? 
 Ok , just a moment , please . Here you are , I need you to sign here , please . And here is your refund . Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 You're welcome . Have a nice day ! 
 There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . 
 No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . 
 You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . 
 No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . 
 I ’ Ve got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That ’ s easy ; but I have another problem to deal with . 
 No , I did that a long time ago . It ’ s about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus . 
 Yes . He ’ s never said anything so I never told him . But now that he ’ s getting older ... 
 Yes , he ’ s too old to believe in that type of things . And I ’ d rather tell him before the kids at school do . 
 I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son . 

Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree . 
 Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . 
 A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room . 
 But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . 
 But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . 
 Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should . 
 I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church . 
 Have you got anything cheaper ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 All right . I think I'll take it . 
 You mean this month ? 
 Over 2 million . 
 What words ? Can you tell me ? 
 Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . 
 I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . 
 Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . 

Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? 
 I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . 
 My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now . 
 Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something . 
 I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star . 
 Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . 
 Good morning . 
 I ’ m sorry.She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nine.Can I take a message for her ? 
 OK.Goodbye . 

How much is it to rent an economy car ? 
 Could I have one for tomorrow morning ? 
 Sure here it is .

 Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ’ t you ? 
 I ’ d like to know more about it . 
 OK . I will be there .

What's the most popular paper circulating in the community ?

 Would it be okey to look at the room , now ? 
 This apartment looks nice . 
 How much is the rents ? 
 This apartment is nice , but I'd like to find a cheaper one . 
 Not even a single drop ? 
 I don't know . Since yesterday morning , the water pressure has dropped to a little more than a drip . 
 Yeah , I called and they said they'd send someone over . 
 It was 36 hours ago . 

It's Sunday today . 
 I think we should have a house cleaning today . What's your opinion ? 
 Come on . What do you want to do ? Washing clothes or cleaning the house ? 
 Okay . Here is the laundry . 
 Don't worry . I'll help you with it later . 
 Let me see . Here it is . 
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t because I ’ m a stranger here . 
 Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there . 
 Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here . 
 Oh , I guess I didn't see it . 
 Here they are . 
 Thank you , Ma'am . 
 Same here . Hey , did you know Susan is going to get married . She invited me to her wedding and she wants you to attend also . 
 Definitely . I'm calling to tell you this . 
 She tried , but the line is always busy .

 Pretty good . I've just bought a new house . 
 In the suburb . How are you and Carol ? Still living in town ? 
 Okay . Don't forget to call Susan .

Welcome to McDonald's . Can I take your order ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 Will that be it ? 

Excuse me , could you tell me where I can get a shopping basket ? 
 Well , I can't find the way to the entrance . Would you tell me where the entrance is ? 
 Thank you very much . By the way , where are the vegetables ? 

Do you have any seats available ? 
 What's the special today ? 
 Then give me a large one and an egg drop soup . 

Where are you going for lunch ? 
 I know of a restaurant . I'm sure you'll like it . 
 Yes.it serves excellent Sichuan food . Spicy food may improve your appetite . 

Is supper ready ? I'm hungry . 
 Ok . What are we having ? 
 I'll have my beef well-done , please . By the way , don't we have soup tonight ? 
 Let me see . Well , I'd like onion soup . Thank you . 
 How many times have you been here ? 
 I would like to sit near the window . 
 Thank you . 
 Fast food restaurants are popular now . 
 I'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry . 
 Coke please . Oh , no , a cup of hot chocolate will be fine . 
 I'd like a coke . 
 Okay . 
 Red . 
 Yes sir . How can I help you ? 
 OK . And anything else I can do for you ? 
 Sure . 
 I ’ m looking for a bookcase , but I don ’ t want to buy a new one . 
 Not really . There aren ’ t any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I ’ ll go to them . 
 Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
 What happened ? 

Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . 
 A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 When is the place available ? 

Good coming , Sir . 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 Here we are . 
 Nine pounds twenty . 
 Thank you . Sir 

Don't you think all of the money goes to the ads and we have nothing to read . 
 Extra income.They can get rich with sheer ads . 
 Hi , Rita , I ’ m just looking for a pair of shoes . I won ’ t be here for long . 
 That ’ s my problem . I don ’ t have a lot of options . 
 Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . 
 After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . 
 Mm , I just need something about business news.Can you recommend some ? 
 Thank you . I'll have one . 
 Yes . Can I help you ?

 We also serve sandwiches and cakes .

So what do you think of my new dress ? 
 Um , ninety-five dollars ? 
 I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ’ s Boutique . I didn ’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
 I don ’ t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . 
 No , I ’ m not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? 
 No , Officer , not at all . 
 Well , I guess I just wasn ’ t paying attention to the speedometer . 
 Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . 
 Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions .

 All right . I'll do my best . 
 The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ . 
 Do you need a receipt ? 

Hi , taxi . 
 The international airport , please . I have to be there by 8 
 Oh , that's my stop . How much do I need to pay ? 
 Thanks a lot.here . 
 I'm going to the Golden hotel . 
 Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10 
 Thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back , please . 
 This is Soft , may I speak to Lamely ? 
 Hello , Lamley.Are you free tomorrow ? 
 Would you like to go to an activation with me ? 
 See you . 
 Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery.And they are all newly renovated . 
 No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . 
 Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there . 
 Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you can't find the right place . 

A friend told me might find a room here . 
 What do you charge ? 
 OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ? 

Marketing manage office , can I help you ? 
 Sorry , he's out . 
 Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? 
 That's fine.please call again later . 

This is the house I want to rent . 
 No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . 
 200 dollars per week . 
 It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . 
 Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? 
 Twice a week for work and once for shopping . 
 That's true . Ok , I will think about it . 
 Where did he go ? 
 Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . 
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 

Hello , Anna speaking ! 
 Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? 
 I am fine . What have you been doing ? 
 That's great , congratulations ! 
 That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you . 
 How long have you been working there ? 
 How do you like your new boss ? 
 Much better than the last one , huh ? 
 Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk . 
 8 it is . See you then . 

Excuse me , could you help me ? 
 Well . I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ? 
 I think so . I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store . 
 In the shoe department . I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques . 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 You are right . Do you have a pen ? 
 Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel . 
 Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ? 
 Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes . 
 Yes , do you have an appointment ? 
 Well . The doctor doesn't see nobody without an appointment . 
 Oh , I see . Maybe we can fit you in at 3 . 
 Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ? 
 How about traveler's insurance ? 
 Can you pay cash , then ? 
 All right , all right , relax . I am only trying to do my job . 

How do I set up an E-mail account ? 
 Which link ? 
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It's asking me for a password . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , I see . 

Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ? 
 Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now . 
 I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ? 
 Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ? 
 Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ? 
 Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ? 
 All right . I guess I'll take a taxi then . How long will it take by taxi ? 
 Cool , thanks . 

Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there . 
 Sir , sir , are you all right , sir ? 
 Oh , no . He is not breathing and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 . 

Excuse me , sir . You can't park here . 
 Sir , the curb here is not for parking . 
 There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it . 
 I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault . 
 That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day . 
 I am serious . Every morning I set my watch by the radio , but it still loses ten minutes . 
 Throw it away and buy a new one . 
 So you put your watch back ten minutes every day ? 
 Why bother ? Just buy a new watch . It doesn't cost much . Besides , I just can ’ t put up with this thing any more . 
 A haircut and a shave , please . 
 Short on both sides . Not so much off at the back . 
 Yes , please . 
 Well . I would like my hair cut shorter on the temples . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , thanks . But I'd like a facial massage . 
 Now where should I pay the money ? 

It's been a long time , Mrs , Lee . 
 When did you come back ? Did you have a good time ? 
 I will . How would you like your hair today ? The same style as usual ? 
 That's true . Here are some samples of hairstyles . What do you think about this one ? 
 Very well . You aren't in a hurry , are you ? 
 Ok . The manicurist will be right here . 
 It's 90 dollars in all . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Alright . I'll send someone over tomorrow . 
 Fine , I'll be up in a few minutes . 

So what's wrong with the drain ? 
 Let me take a look . You know why ? It's clogged with hair . No wonder water won't go down . 
 You ’ re darn right ! 
 Don't worry . I ’ Ve got some acid here . It will help dissolve the hair down there . 
 Now you know you have to clean your bathtub every time when you use it . 
 Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough . 
 Well , I ’ m going to move out anyway . The new apartment has central air-conditioning . 
 Well , I had to wait until the lease expired . So ... 
 Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little . 
 You are going to have a huge bill . 
 Don't you wanna get it fixed now ? 
 Well , if you need anything , just let me know . 
 You sure have bad luck these days . 
 Oh , it runs every 20 mins . You must have missed it , when you came here . It should be here any minute now . 
 Yes , I do . You can go to the Transport Department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map . 

Taxi . 
 Thank you . Pls hurry , I am late . Can I get to the Battery Park before 4 ? 
 How exactly do you figure out the car fare ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Thank you . How much do I owe you ? 
 That's 20 dollars . Keep the change ! 

Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . 
 We are now running late . 
 Let me check and look at the map . Yes , there is an exit three quarters of a mile ahead . We ’ ll exit Market Street , head west , then get on the Pennsylvania Freeway . 

Fill it up , PLS . 
 Premium , PLS . Could you check my tyres , too ? I think they need air . 
 I don't think so . It's brand-new . 
 Yes , PLS . I also need you to check the oil and the radiator . 
 Pls fill it up with water then . 
 Do you take credit card ? 
 30 dollars and 10 cents ? Here you go . 

Can you do me a favor ? 
 Can you keep an eye on my bag , please ? Nature's calling . 
 No , I just want to use the bathroom . 

Can you lend me some money ? 
 You ’ Ve gone through all your money so quickly ? I thought you were well-off . 

Ok , so where do you think we can save more money ? 
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ? 
 Come on . If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy . 
 Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt . 

We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ? 
 Well , I think we could be saving more . 
 Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month . 
 We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account . 
 Right . 
 I don't know . Where did you leave it ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Well , you should have kept an eye on it . 
 Ok , here is $ 50 . Oh , can you make out an invoice for me ? 
 No , I am a teacher . I teach art . 
 It is . You must be new here . I do my shopping here regularly , once a week . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you , too . 
 Sorry , all the tables for three are reserved . 
 Yes , smoking or non-smoking ? 
 Come with me , please . 
 Yes , I wanna buy a skirt . 
 I am not sure . 
 Ok , thank you . 

Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 What do they look like ? 
 How tall are they ? 
 Do they look like roses ? 
 Oh , lilies of the valley . No , I am sorry . We are all out of them right now . 
 What about roses ? 
 As many as you like , sir . They are beautiful , aren't they ? 

Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window . 
 Have you been drinking ? 
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow to the breathalyzer , please . 
 If you refuse the blow , you'll receive a ticket and your vehicle will be impounded . 
 Your BAC exceeds legal limit . 
 I'll have to write you a ticket and impound your vehicle . 

Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ? 
 I am sorry , madam . I didn't hear you . It's too noisy here . Could you please say it again ? 
 Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , certainly , madam . 
 Yes , it is . This perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of Chanel . 
 55 dollars , madam . 
 Thank you . Do you need something else ? 

Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? 
 Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . 
 Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? 
 That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? 
 I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . 
 Well , it's all new stock in the window now . 
 Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . 
 Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . 
 That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for . 

Hi , waiting for the bus ? Where are you going ? 
 Why don't you take a taxi ? It'll get you there much faster . 

Could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you run over to the store ? We need a few things . 
 Well , could you pick up some sugar ? 
 A small bag . I guess we also need a few oranges . 
 Oh , let's see . . . About six . 
 Yes . We're out of milk . 
 No . I think a half gallon will be enough . 
 I think so . Have you got all that ? 
 Do you have enough money ? 
 Thanks very much . I appreciate it . 
 Certainly . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you know what size he wears ? 
 And what color would you like ? 
 Okay . Let's see . . . a size 36 dark brown leather belt . Oh , yes . Her e we are . Do you think your husband will like this one ? 
 Will this be cash or charge ? 
 No , I'm afraid not . We only accept our own store credit card . 

Could I speak to Mary , please ? 
 This is Bob . Where have you been , Mary ? I have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 
 I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? 
 But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! 
 I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . 
 Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? 
 No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ? 
 It is all right . I will call the boss and tell him I am staying another day . I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it . 
 I will tell you tomorrow . See you tomorrow , Mary . 

My Goodness ! What a busy line so early in the morning ! Hello . 
 Hi , Basil . 
 Yes , by all means . I was just about to leave . 
 I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you . 
 Hi , Basil . 
 Do you mind if I take some notes while we drive ? 
 Yes , I finally have an inspiration . 

Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 And to drink ? 
 Is this dine-in or take-out ? 

Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . 
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
 I don't want to do that to you , Karen . 
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
 You look a little lost , can I help you ? 
 Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . 
 Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? 
 Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . 
 No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 
 I see . What else ? 
 Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 

what do we need to get from the supermarket ? 
 a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? 
 we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . 
 I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . 
 we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves . 
 I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . 
 I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go . 
 Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
 Fine ! What do you need ? 
 Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! 
 Is that all , your majesty ? 

Welcome to the National Post . How may I help you ? 
 Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package . 
 Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? 
 Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online . 

have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ? 
 I ’ m having the same problem . I want to get something really special . Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts . 
 he bought me an iron . 
 maybe not , but my iron was getting old . In fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . It ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working ! 
 yes , I do . Let ’ s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic . 
 I ’ ll be happy to get him something special , even if it coasts a little extra . 

Honey , can you set the table ? 
 Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . 
 Yeah go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . 
 Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? 
 Oops ! 
 maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they 
 then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . 
 what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend 

Hello , 332440 . 
 I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet . 
 Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back . 
 All right . Goodbye , Dave . 

pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? 
 thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? 
 well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . 
 yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . 
 yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do . 

my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place . 
 Do you know any places ? 
 thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . 
 I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . 
 it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . 
 I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . 
 why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? 
 thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . 

May I see a hat , please ? 
 I'm sorry . I don't know . 
 Brown , please . 
 Yes , I like this one.It goes very well with my coat . How much is it ? 

that was a really good meal , Gordon . 
 well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . 
 let's see how much the bill is . 
 what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . 
 no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . 
 that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . 
 you've got a deal . 
 bye . 
 thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 
 yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . 
 yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th 
 that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . 

oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? 
 Cindy , you're so cute . 
 I have a little white cat . 
 yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . 
 not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
 absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 
 yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
 now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 
 cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? 
 is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets 
 of course , that's something really irritation . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb 
 Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! 
 maybe you have a point . 
 all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! 
 oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . 
 why not try it on ? 
 yes . 

can I get you something to drink ? 
 so how about an aperitif ? 
 stirred or shaken ? 
 here you are . 
 sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . 
 try a Singer . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice . 
 here we go . 
 enjoy yourself . 

I'm going to the hospital to see Susan Green . 
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? 
 Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? 
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 

my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . 
 that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . 
 yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . 
 256MB . 

Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? 
 why ? anything special there ? 
 Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? 
 that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . 
 why not ? it's so cool . 
 pardon ? 
 well , I didn't realize that . 
 oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . 

There isn't much rice , is there ? 
 Are there any potatoes ? 
 I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ? 
 But I want some rice and some meat . 
 Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ? 

your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 
 really ? Do you often shop online ? 
 I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? 
 sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . 
 well , are there any other advantages ? 
 are there many choices of online shopping ? 
 perhaps I should have a try . 
 Where shall I put it , miss ? 
 But Peter and Tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago.Now it's full . 
 Yes , miss . 
 In the playground , miss . 

How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 

No , it hasn't . It's very dirty . 
 Mark should clean it . It's his turn . 
 No , it isn't . You always clean it after Mark . 
 Clean it now . Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow . 
 You are lazy . You ought to be ashamed ? You should enjoy working . 
 Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! 
 Well , healthy food , of course ! I got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... 
 They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ... 
 Yup , better for the environment and better for us ! 
 I like doughnuts . 
 I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment . 
 I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Ok . Does he know your number ? 
 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . 
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! 
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . 
 While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . 

Telco Mobile , how can I help you ? 
 Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling . 
 Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate . 
 Yes of course . We can activate all these services in about an hour . 
 Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... 
 I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! 
 I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine . 
 Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? ! 
 What are you getting ? 
 Don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it . 
 I ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter . 

Anything else I can do for you ?

Hi , good morning , Miss ? what can I help you with ? 
 OK , please put it on this scale.Airmail or by sea ? 
 Usually about two month . 
 About ten days . 
 Let me see.It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax . 
 Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea . 
 Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?

Why did your parents make you stay at home ? 
 Didn't you mind doing it ? 
 Didn't you even want to go to the cinema ? 
 What was on television last night ? 
 Oh . I enjoy watching boxing on television , too.What a pity I missed it last night ! 
 I went to a boxing match in the sports stadium . 
 Hello , Claire . This is Mick . 
 Fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Good . Listen . I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party . At our Newhouse . And . . 
 Yes . We've moved . That's why we're giving the party . Can you come ? 
 This Saturday evening . 
 Until two in the morning . But you don't have to stay that long.Well ? What about it ? 
 Nothing . I mean , don't bring anything . It isn't necessary . 
 Just bring yourself ! I'm looking forward to seeingyou again . It's been a long time ! 
 Come any time after eight . All right ? . 
 Bye ! See you on Saturday evening . 

Can you deliver it , please ? 
 In Camden Town . 
 All right . But I'm only in on Saturday . 
 Afternoon , please , if that's possible . 
 What the magic ward to say if you want something good to happen ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Amy , you forgot another magic word . 
 You are very welcome . 
 I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . 
 If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . 
 Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit . 
 Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c 
 I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . 
 Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . 
 Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . 
 I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you 

I heard there is a big yard sale at weeks this saturday morning , i will go there to see if there is some nice clothes , do you want to go with me ? 
 How about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market ? 

Hello , sir , what can I do for you today ? 
 No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly . 
 Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ? 
 Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts . 
 There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . 
 Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . 
 How do I do that ? 
 That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . 
 I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? 
 So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . 
 How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? 
 How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? 

Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 
 Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
 So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
 I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a 

You're finally here ! What took so long ? 
 It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
 perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
 It would be better for the environment , too . 
 Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
 Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . 
 So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? 

I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat . 
 Will you take long ? 
 Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! 
 Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
 Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
 I hope so , do you have a shopping skirts ? something i could wear working in a ban ? 
 It is nice , may i try it on ? 
 Does this fashion really fit my figure ? 
 Oh , thank you , just shows you what is going to max jemmy redate for all this body . 
 I thought you recognize she from there . 
 Yes , it is really good for my arms and shoulders , ok , i will take this one , do you have a blue in this size style ? i want one for my sister , she has a great figure and she loves blue . 
 Oh , good , do you have a discount for two ? 
 That is great , i will take this two , how much is that ? 
 Ok , 90 dollars , do you accept this card ? 
 Debit card . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thanks , you too , how see your maxes sometime . 
 Thanks , byebye . 
 I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year . 
 That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission . 
 It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway . 
 A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast ! 
 Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back . 

Hello sir , may I help you ? 
 I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . 
 We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . 
 Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . 

Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
 Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . 
 Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? 
 So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? 
 If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? 

It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? 
 Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! 
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 

Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency ! 
 I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP ! 
 No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me ! 
 Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ? 
 Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this ! 
 I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ? 
 Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit . 
 Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . 
 You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays . 

Ok ! I ’ m ready for my driving lesson ! Should I start the car ? 
 We have been through this a million times ! Let ’ s get going already ! I ’ m ready ! 
 I ’ m doing it ! I ’ m driving ! This is awesome ! Let ’ s turn some music on ! 
 Get out of my way ! This is just like playing video games ! 
 They ’ ll never take me alive ! 
 Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera . 
 Actually I ’ m buying a camera for my husband . 
 Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ? 
 The Canon Eos . Yeah it ’ s ok , but I ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life . 
 Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ’ t want some bulky telephoto lens . 
 Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything ! 
 Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ? 
 No you ’ re not ! There are some right here ! 
 Thanks for your help , Ralph ! 

Hi . What can I get for you ? 
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . 
 No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs . 
 Okay , is there anything else ? 
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... 
 Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... 
 Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . 
 I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . 
 It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . 
 I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? 
 I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! 
 Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . 

So can you fix it ? 
 What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
 OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? 
 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 

Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
 Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . 
 Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . 
 No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . 

Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 
 Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? 
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 
 About fourteen . 
 Damn ! 
 Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house . 
 I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . 
 Do I have to pay an installation fee ? 
 Awesome ! 
 Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! 
 Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . 
 That would be great ! Is it expensive ? 

Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . 
 What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . 
 Really ? What ’ s the catch ? 
 So what does this plan include ? 
 Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? 

Do you know what time it is ? 
 Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew . 
 I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister ! 
 You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down ! 
 I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! 
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
 We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! 
 No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! 
 Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . 
 No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal . 

Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . 
 Show me some classic high heels , please . 
 Black . Classic . 
 Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . 
 I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . 
 Seven-and-a-half . 
 Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo 

We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
 Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
 What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . 
 We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . 
 I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . 

Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Nice ! Brunch ! 
 Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
 Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 

I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! 
 On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . 
 Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . 
 You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . 
 I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! 

Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals . 
 Please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , I am sure we could find something that interests you ! 
 We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world ! 
 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 
 You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters ! 
 Well , I also have ... 
 Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class . 
 Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have 
 Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go 
 I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! 
 Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . 
 Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! 

I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! 
 Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . 
 How do you mean " suffer " ? 
 Even in the winter ? 
 And even if it takes two hours , huh ? 
 Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . 
 I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? 
 So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? 
 And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? 
 Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? 
 I wonder if you can cook things this good . 

Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
 There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
 I think my arm is broken . 
 Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . 
 I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? 
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
 It really hurts . 
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
 To hell with you . 
 Yeah ? 
 You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy . 
 What ? 
 What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers . 
 No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ? 
 Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . 
 My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? 
 But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . 
 What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ? 
 In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ? 
 I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ? 
 But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ? 
 Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself . 
 I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ? 
 How are you going to survive here ? I mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.If you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.How can you live on your own ? 
 Well , I'll help you learn how to use these machines . 
 I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today . 

Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! 
 This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now ! 
 Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted . 
 Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ? 
 Great ! Can you set the table ? 
 Wait ! Don ’ t turn it on ... 
 Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
 I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . 
 Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . 

Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? 
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . 
 You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? 
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 

I really appreciate your driving me around . 
 It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . 
 This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . 
 No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency . 
 How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ? 
 That's good . 
 Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 . 
 Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one . 
 256-7797 . 
 This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ? 
 That sounds alright . 
 Here's the number , 256-4367 . 
 Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this . 

Can I help you ? 
 Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ? 
 Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good . 
 It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone . 
 Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ? 
 Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ? 
 Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse . 
 This one sells for $ 39.99 . 
 Of course . 
 Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment . 

Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . 
 We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . 
 Where would you like to sit ? 
 Certainly . 
 NO ! 
 Okay , okay , what do you want ? 
 Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother . 
 Who's this Eric guy ? 
 No can do ... sorry . 
 No way ! 

Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ? 
 We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ? 
 Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? 
 Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free ! 
 wait ! ! I need your address ! 
 Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . 
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 

Hello . May I help you ? 
 That one is one hundred and fifty dollars . 
 That ’ s one hundred and forty . 
 This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price . 
 Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ? 
 Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both . 
 my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer ! 

I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . 
 All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us . 
 Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot . 
 Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? 
 Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . 
 It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ? 

I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? 
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
 It really hurts . 
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
 To hell with you . 
 Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary . 
 Can I return the car in San Francisco ? 
 Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . 
 Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that . 
 Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it . 
 Where are the keys ? 

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I have plenty of gas . 
 So what can we do ? 
 Alright . That's a good idea . 
 Days ? 
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 
 Okay , I'll follow your advice . 
 umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday . 
 No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss . 
 That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous . 
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? 
 Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... 
 Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous . 
 Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! 

Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 
 Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? 
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 
 About fourteen . 
 Damn ! 
 It will be a piece of cake . 
 Don't worry about it . It's just a drop in the bucket . That car has more scratches on it than I can count . 
 Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf . 
 Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation . 
 Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . 
 Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? 
 Sure . Should I wash or dry ? 
 OK . Let's do it . 
 You're welcome . 
 Well here . Help yourself to some shrimp . It's fresh . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother . He's going to take a trip to South America . 
 By air . So my gift should be quite light . What can you suggest ? 
 My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual . 
 Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it . 
 It will be fine . 
 No , don't give it another thought . 
 What is it ? 
 Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's . 
 Please show me the menu again . 
 No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie . 
 Then I'll have vanilla ice cream . 

I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket . 
 No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ? 
 Well , you don ’ t have to be mean . How do I do it ? 
 O . K . Thanks . I ’ ll let you know what I find . 
 I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . 
 Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - - here , in the pool . 
 Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here . 
 No . 
 You got me . 

Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting . 
 Oh , good . 
 Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . 
 I can ’ t find the business card . Do you know the address ? 
 Right . 

Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? 
 What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ? 
 Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . 
 It ’ s all right . Where are you going ? 
 Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . 
 It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 First you make a list of what you wanna buy ... 
 Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ? 
 Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . 
 I think seven hundred is enough . 
 Well , eight hundred , then ? 
 Eight hundred and fifty . Come on . I have 4 kids , 3 dogs , and 2 husbands to feed ! 
 Here you are , sucker ! 

Do you sell washing machines ? 
 Is that a Danish machine ? The name looks Danish . 
 Sure . I ’ d like to see how it washes . 
 Then what about the wire ? 
 So I know . Thanks . 
 They ’ re all doing fine . Let me show you some of their pictures . 
 That ’ s Charles . 
 All my children are large . 
 That ’ s James . 
 All my children are agile . 
 That ’ s Joanna . Joanna hopes to go to college . 

What are you doing , Victor ? 
 What for ? 
 Party ? What party ? 
 Oh , I forget . Who ’ s invited ? 
 Can I help you get ready ? 
 Ok , just leave it to me . I ’ ll take care of it . 

Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but how do I know the subway train is going south ? 
 O . K . , so it ’ s this one ? 
 Oh , sorry . 

Good morning . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment downtown . 
 Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 520 a month . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 No , thank you ! I want an apartment , not a prison . 
 Engaged ? She ’ s married . 
 Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer . 
 At what address , sir ? 
 O . K . Your name please ? 
 One moment please . Very well , Mr . Smith . I need to ask you a few questions . 
 The interview will take about 15 minutes , and your phone will be turned on in 24 hours . 
 O . K . Mr . Smith . Thanks for calling . 
 Good day . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment today . 
 Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 900 a month . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 No , thank you ! I want to take an apartment , not a prison . 

Where ’ s the wagon ? 
 The water wagon . 
 The wagon with the water , of course . 
 No , you can ’ t do that . There isn ’ t much water in the wagon . And we need the water for drinking . 
 Are there many accidents in the city every day ? 
 Please drive slowly , we've got lots of time . Safety first . 
 No way . Do it yourself . 
 OK , I'll iron your shirt for you , but only if you make me a cup of coffee . 
 Ok , what do you want me to do ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 
 While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way . 
 My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? 
 Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 
 All right . Where do you live , sir ? 
 Very well . Why do you want to disconnect your phone , sir ? 
 O . K . May I have your name please ? 
 Thank you . Mr . Smith . What ’ s your telephone number ? 
 Thank you . Where should I send your final phone bill ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Smith . Your phone will be disconnected after this phone call . Have a nice day . 

Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 I'm going to get one for myself . They make really good coffee here . 

I'm very sorry , sir . My car has broken down . 
 I'm afraid not . 

Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? 
 I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? 
 I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters . 
 OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 
 Good morning , Mr . Church . I ’ d like some lamb chops for the children ’ s lunch . 
 Yes . I ’ ll take four shoulder chops and I ’ d like a small chicken . 
 Which one is cheaper ? 
 How much is all that ? I don ’ t have much cash . Can I give you a check ? 

Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? 
 The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . 
 There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . 
 No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . 
 Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . 
 Why are you always so mean ? 
 I could help pay for it . 
 O . K . Thanks , Mom ! 
 I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . 
 Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! 
 Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . 
 I think about ten minutes by bus . 
 Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . 
 Hello . What time do you close , please ? 
 Oh . Ok . And are you open on the weekends ? 
 Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ? 
 Ok , I'll come down tonight . Thanks . 

Good morning . Craftsman Company . Can I help you ? 
 You must have dialed the wrong number . 
 Sorry . This is 321-9887 . 
 It's ok . 
 Hello . Mr . Higgins , please . 
 Oh yes , this is Penny's Pet Boutique . Please remind him that his appointment for his dog's shampoo and cut is on Saturday morning at 11 am . 
 That's fine . 

Hello . 
 No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? 
 B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . 
 That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . 
 At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? 
 See you around , Carl . 

Hi , welcome to the Belt Department . Can I help you today ? 
 Then , perhaps a leather belt would work . Come here . Let me show you some . 

Can I stay out all night with my friends ? 
 But we'll be careful . 

You have to finish your dinner before you leave the table . 
 What's the matter ? It doesn't taste good ? 

I'm looking forward to our son's graduation this weekend . 
 Well , dear , we can't force him to go to college . It's up to him . 

I have been washing the dishes for over a week now . 
 No . We made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes . Now it's your turn to do them . 

Harry , come here immediately ! 
 Don't take that tone with me ! I saw you hit your brother . 
 I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes . 
 I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . 
 Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . 
 It's nice , but still too expensive . Can you give me a 20 % discount ? 
 Come on . Let's split the difference , 15 % . 
 Gee , how dangerous ! I've almost knocked him down . 
 I braked as hard as I could . 
 we just moved in yesterday , actually . 
 it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . 
 it's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history ! 
 it's just off of the ring road . 
 it's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . 
 oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . 
 right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest room i 

Read Jimmy's card to me please , Janey . 
 Eh ? 
 The what ? 
 What else does he say ? 
 What ? Speak up , Janey . I'm afraid I can't hear you . 
 Is that all ? He doesn't say very much , does he ? 

I'm hungry . Let's go to the snack bar . 
 I am going to try Gado Gado . 
 it's a kind of rice ball that is made in Malaysia . What about you ? 
 do you want noodles , vegetables , rice , meat , seafood , beans , or dessert ? 
 have you ever tried tempura ? 
 it's deep fried vegetables , which is commonly eaten in Japan . 
 most people eat tempura with chopsticks , but you can use a fork if you don't know how to use chopsticks . 
 let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi . 
 I used to buy lunch every day from the International food stall at school . Every day was an adventure ! 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 A glass of Qingdao beer . 
 Will you make some recommendation ? 
 I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! A little labor , much health . 
 Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ? 
 I'll just go and check it for you , sir . 
 Sure , what would you like ? 
 Why don ’ t you have a water or juice instead , so you don ’ t get dehydrated ? 

I finally found an apartment that I want to rent . 
 I saw it in this ad for apartments in today ’ s newspaper . 
 I really did , but what ’ s so great about it is that it ’ s really affordable . 
 Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful . 
 The rent is $ 725 each month . 
 That ’ s what I said when I found out how much the rent was . 

Excuse me ! 
 Is this your handbag ? 
 Is this your handbag ? 

What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? 
 It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ? 
 I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。 
 I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . 
 Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . 
 It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us . 
 But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . 
 True , and I like the kitchen.It ' s new and well equipped . 
 You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . 
 I haven't thought of that . 
 I ’ m glad you like it . 
 The rent is $ 1050 each month . 
 It isn ’ t too much . 
 I can ’ t take that . 
 I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you . 
 If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal . 
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? 
 You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 
 Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . 
 Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . 
 Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . 
 Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . 
 This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . 
 Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su 
 Yes , they are . How many would you like and of which color ? 
 Are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ? 
 Thank you very much , sir . I ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you . 

May I speak to the apartment building manager , please ? 
 I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available . 
 Yes , it would be nice to see the apartment . 
 Yes , I can be there at 6 . 
 I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest . 
 Is there anything that I need to bring with me ? 

Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? 
 I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It's on sale , isn't it . 
 I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters . 
 OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 
 You can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ’ s go inside . 
 I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better . 
 I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ’ s go check it out . 
 The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better . 
 I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ’ s go look at another house . 
 It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside . 
 You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . 
 Let ’ s go check out the kitchen . The printout says that it is quite large . 
 Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please . 
 Perhaps we should move on to the next listing . 
 Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking . 
 Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ? 
 Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ? 
 Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ? 
 I'll give you an application form when I see you . 
 No . Just bring yourself . 
 Great , thanks . 
 I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ? 
 Is 6 o ’ clock Friday evening okay ? 
 Thank you very much . See you then . 
 I ’ m fine , thank you . 
 If I could , I would like to view the apartment sometime today . 
 Why is that ? 
 I would like to make one right now if I can . 
 Can we do it at 6 o ’ clock ? 
 All right . I ’ ll see you on Friday . 
 I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ? 
 I haven't rented it out yet . Would you like to see it ? 
 How about today at 6 p . m . ? 
 Very good . We'll meet at 6 . Do you need directions ? 
 If you're interested , you can fill out an application form . 
 No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license . 
 I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
 I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . 
 I did notice a few stains in the carpet . 
 You will ? 
 That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . 
 It is . I love it . 
 It is beautiful . 
 Actually , there is a problem . 
 There are some stains that were left in the carpet . 
 Oh , is that right ? 
 That was the only problem that I saw . 
 I honestly love it . 
 Everything ’ s fine with me . 
 Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ? 
 Why can ’ t I view it today ? 
 I understand . May I make an appointment then ? 
 Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I absolutely love the apartment . 
 I do have one problem with the apartment . 
 I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet . 
 I did not know that . 
 That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment . 
 It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it . 
 That ’ s great . 
 The rent each month is $ 1050 . 
 Did you have a better price in mind ? 
 That ’ s way too low . 
 How about $ 900 a month ? 
 Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you . 
 First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? 
 I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in . 
 Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of . 
 You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . 
 There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found . 
 The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time . 
 You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . 
 Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . 
 That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . 
 I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is ! 
 Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ? 
 I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through . 
 The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future . 
 I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems . 
 I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist . 
 You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you . 
 Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in . 
 An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in . 
 I think that will work out just fine . It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold . 
 My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day . 
 I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ? 
 Yes , it's still vacant . Are you interested in seeing it ? 
 I will be at the apartment today at 6 
 Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ? 
 I'll be bringing an application form . 
 No . I might need to see your ID card , but that's about it . 
 First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ? 
 I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it . 
 Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken . 
 The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced . 
 The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . 
 The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday . 
 You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . 
 If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . 
 That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . 
 I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is . 
 yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . 
 yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . 
 no , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . 
 yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . 
 This is he . What can I do for you ? 
 It's still available . Do you want to see it ? 
 Does today at 6 p . m . sound okay to you ? 
 Okay , I'll see you at 6 o'clock . Do you need any directions ? 
 I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested . 
 No . I only need to check your driver's license . 
 ok , what do you want me to do ? 
 ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 
 while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way . 
 my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? 
 keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . 
 You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom . 
 Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store . 
 You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . 

I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? 
 I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . 
 do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? 
 yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . 
 that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . 
 ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . 
 I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys 
 yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . 
 as I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to information I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . The 
 you ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the information I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . 
 We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef.You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops . 
 Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I ’ ll boring a bottle of wine . 
 Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties . 
 I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up . 
 They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes . 
 I have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop . 
 It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . 
 I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians . 
 excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . 
 about ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . 
 yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high - pitch noise when it ’ s in use . 
 what ’ s wrong with it ? 
 that ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it.First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler . 
 After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil.Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it . 
 These ones here.The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . 
 Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly.Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan.Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . 
 I ’ m mixing the sauce.It ’ s my speciality . I make it according to my own secret recipe . 
 You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . 
 No dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables . 
 You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . 
 I'll remember that for next time.You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ? 

What would you like for dessert ? 
 I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . 
 Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . 
 Sure.Can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator . 
 Yes , I ’ ll have an ice tea.You see it next to the lemonade . 
 I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight . 
 Do I have to get up now ? 
 What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet . 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 Just let me sleep five more minutes . 
 I know , I know . But I don't want any worms . 

I think I may rent this apartment from you . 
 How much are you looking to rent it for ? 
 That is too expensive . 
 How does $ 850 a month sound to you ? 
 That ’ s the best that I can do . 
 Would you please reconsider ? 

I think I may rent this apartment from you . 
 Can you tell me how much I would have to pay for rent ? 
 That ’ s way too much . 
 I can afford about $ 800 a month for rent . 
 How much more are you thinking ? 
 That ’ s almost perfect . 

Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? 
 Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? 
 What do landlords charge for rent ? 
 There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . 
 I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . 

When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ? 
 Can I share an apartment with someone ? 
 Are apartments expensive in this city ? 
 I want a two-bedroom apartment . 
 Would you have time to go look at apartments with me ? 

I want to rent this apartment . 
 How much are you asking ? 
 I can ’ t afford that . 
 I was thinking $ 800 a month . 
 How much more ? 
 I can live with that . 

How did you find your apartment ? 
 What if I need a roommate ? 
 How much do apartments cost around here ? 
 I just need a one-bedroom apartment . 
 Would you come with me to look at apartments ? 

It's time for bed . 
 It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . 
 Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . 
 You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? 
 An excellent idea . Work now and play later . 
 No , now it's bedtime . 
 I ’ m happy to hear you say that . 
 I ’ m renting this apartment out for $ 1050 a month . 
 That is a fair price . 
 That ’ s no good . 
 I won ’ t go any lower than $ 1050 . 
 That ’ s the best I can do . 
 Where did you find this apartment ? 
 Really ? I can ’ t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads . 
 I want to hear more about this apartment . 
 How much will you have to pay for rent ? 
 For where we live , that is really inexpensive . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that you finally found an apartment . 
 Really ? You are joking ? 
 I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first . 
 Hmm , let me see . Boil some water , and then whisk two eggs . 
 Not bad . OK , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge . 
 Three . And bring four bell peppers . 
 Now wash them , then dice the potatoes and bell peppers , then slice the meat . 
 It's in the cabinet . Adam , The gas cooker doesn't work . 
 Let me take a look at that . I can't stop the bleeding.We need to go to the hospital . 

I think I may rent out this apartment that I found . 
 I was looking through the ads today , and I found it in there . 
 Yeah , and it ’ s affordable too . 
 First of all , it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
 It ’ s only $ 725 a month . 
 I know it is . 

Dai Ling . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 Can you bring me a glass of orange juice , please ? I am quite thirsty . 
 Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . 
 They're soft . 
 No more , thank you . 
 Bottom is up . 
 I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection . 
 Yes , your number is out of service . 
 So I couldn't get through . 
 Well , the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service . 
 We usually eat chicken , pork and beef.you eat these meat a lot in your country too , don't you ? 
 I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops . 
 Yes , I have , I tried once when I visited your country last year , I think they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . 
 Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing ’ s as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . 
 Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? 
 I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It ’ s appetizing and tasty . 

Can I take your order now , Madam ? 
 I'm happy to recommend the fish , It testes delicious , and it is today's special . Our chef is from the coast , and love seafood . Today special is actually his favorite dish . so I'm sure it is a 
 Is there anything else ? Maybe I can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot . 
 Yes , here's the menu . What would you think of your order . 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Ok , is that all ? 
 what would you like anything to drink or you wait ? 

Would you like to order now , madam ? 
 How would you like your steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? 
 What kind of potatoes would like to go with that , mushed , boiled , or baked ? 
 Good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ? 
 Will you have desert to be , madam ? 
 OK , I'll be with you in a moment . 
 I'm ask for a pizza , please . 
 You're right , that is great . 
 Medium one will be perfect , thank you 
 I like seafood on my pizza . 
 Tuna sounds good today . 
 That would be to go . 
 No problem . 
 I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please . 
 Just coke will be fine . 
 That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . 
 Yes , that's all . 
 You got it . 
 Nice to meet you . My name ’ s Sophie . 
 Yes , I ’ m . Are you French , too ? 
 What nationality are you ? 
 No , I ’ m not . 
 I ’ m a keyboard operator . What ’ s your job ? 

What color is your new dress ? 
 Thanks you . 
 That ’ s a nice dress . It ’ s very smart . 
 What color is it ? 
 That ’ s a lovely hat . 
 Thank you , Mr . Jackson . 
 How do you do ? Those women are very hard-working . What are their jobs ? 
 How do you do ? They aren ’ t very busy ! What are their jobs ? 
 Who is this young man ? 

Give me some glasses please , Jane . 
 No , not those . The ones on the shelf . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thanks . 
 I ’ m going to put it on this table , Sam . 
 What are you going to do with it ? 
 Be careful . Don ’ t drop it ! Don ’ t put it there , Sam . Put it here , on this shelf . 
 Those flowers are lovely , too . 
 Hi , Steven . 
 I ’ m very well , Thank you . And you ? 
 He ’ s fine , Thanks . How ’ s Emma ? 
 Nice to see you , too , Steven . Goodbye . 
 Which book ? This one ? 
 This one ? 
 Here you are . 

I need to talk to you about something . 
 I have some questions about my lease . 
 Exactly how long is my lease for ? 
 What will happen if I move out before then ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 Okay , I think that I understand . 

Would you like some cookies ? I just made them . 
 These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored . 
 No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions . 

Can we talk ? 
 I ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease . 
 How many years is my lease for ? 
 Can I move out before those three years ? 
 Why would you keep it ? 
 I get it now . 

I would like to talk to you , if you have time . 
 I want to discuss some things about my lease . 
 Can you tell me when my lease is up ? 
 If I ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , I see . 

What kind of place shall we rent ? 
 Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
 I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . 
 Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . 
 I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Could you tell me your name and order again , please ? I ’ ll check on the delay . 
 Thank you , Mr . Morris . Please wait one moment and let me check on the order . Would you like anything to drink , sir ? On the house . 
 An old one . 
 It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ? 
 well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one . 
 Is it a four-door or a two-door ? 
 Does it have automatic transmission ? . 
 I guess I might take a look at it . 
 I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
 I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . 
 I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
 the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
 that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
 yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . 
 are you looking for somewhere for two people ? 
 yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ? 
 how many rooms do you need in the flat ? 
 ok . i've got a list of place that fit your requirements . let's just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t 
 it's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a 
 of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there . 

I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? 
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . 
 Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . 
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? 
 I made strawberry shortcake . 
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 
 do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? 
 definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? 
 what happened ? 
 I'll go with you . Where is she ? 
 is she alright ? 
 don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . 
 ok . Just call me if you need anything then . 

is that your rabbit ? 
 that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . 
 rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? 
 i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? 
 that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? 
 can you train a rabbit to do things ? 
 that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? 

this bloody computer ! 
 my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! 
 i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery . 
 oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . 
 it's a PC . doesn't everyone have a PC in this office ? 
 what's the difference ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 yes . 
 fortunately , I saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be OK . 
 that's a good idea . I'll call them now . Thanks for your help ! 
 I know and they are really nice , too . 
 Me , too . 
 Good idea , especially at this price . 
 yes , doesn't everyone ? 
 it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of . 
 when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home . 
 definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters . 
 i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away . 
 she left through a window that was open one night and never returned . 
 i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day ! 
 I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around . 
 i do , too . 
 In America , most children start primary school at the age of five . 
 Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day . 
 no , most children in America only go to school Monday through Friday . 
 In most schools , they study about nine subjects . 
 some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't . 
 I went to a private school for elementary school and university , but went to a public school for high school . What about you ? 
 did you have to wear uniforms ? 
 at least you didn't waste time thinking about what you were going to wear every day ! 

I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . 
 But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . 
 What's the difference ? 
 And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? 
 But they aren't as light , right ? 
 That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . 
 My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too . 
 I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet . 
 No , but she exercises more than me . 
 Here it is . This is what my sister has . 
 I wonder if they have my size . 
 Here in America , it's six . 
 It's none of your business . Let me try them on . 
 I've always got room for something sweet ! 
 I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first . 
 I believe they add locally produced honey to it . 
 do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece . 
 what do you think ? How does it taste ? 
 sure . I'll just have a bite . 
 it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had ! 
 ok . I've had one of those before . They're really sweet and crunchy . 
 I believe they are a local delicacy in the South . 
 yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is ! 

I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . 
 What does it come with standard ? 
 Cruise control ? I don't like that . 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . 
 I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 
 I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . 
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? 
 My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . 
 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 
 Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car . 
 Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else.The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . 

Why don't we get you some shirts ? 
 But we should get you some shirts while we're here . You need summer shirts . 
 Why ? They have everything here . 
 Let's just look and see what they have . 
 What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? 
 Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . 
 Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on . 
 I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on . 
 The fitting rooms are over there . 
 It looks good on you . 
 No , it looks great.Why are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good . 
 I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too . 
 You should be happy I want you to look good.If I let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything . 

I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . 
 What instructions ? 
 I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . 
 Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? 
 Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? 
 Alright . 
 Sawdust ? 
 That makes sense . 
 And I can choose any color ? 
 And after the varnish ? 
 And then ? 
 It all sounds very complicated . 
 Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it . 

How can I help you ?

What should I get Uncle Teddy ? 
 Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . 
 Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . 
 That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . 
 Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . 
 Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . 
 Yes . 
 What should he have then ? 
 I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? 
 Alright . We can go later then . 
 Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? 
 Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? 
 I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . 
 Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ? 
 I see . And does your son have a VCR now ? 
 Does he watch a lot of movies ? 
 I would like to make a suggestion then , sir . 
 If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself . 
 May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? 
 It is very similar . The technology is the same . 
 For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . 
 It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . 
 If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . 
 Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . 
 Yes , it is , sir . 
 This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot . 
 So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future . 

Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ? 
 Is this 777-9345 ? 
 Oh , I ’ m so sorry . 

Hello . Is Becky there , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . 
 She ’ s in the garden , Jane . 
 She ’ s sitting under the tree . 
 Yes , he is . He ’ s climbing the tree . 
 Tim is . 
 The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . 
 OK , what would you like ? 
 Sure and which one would you like ? 

Do you like coffee , Ann ? 
 Do you want a cup ? 
 Do you want any sugar ? 
 Do you want any milk ? 
 Do you like biscuits ? 
 Do you want one ? 

You ’ re working hard , George . What are you doing ? 
 Which hammer . This one ? 
 Here you are . 
 What are you going to do now , George ? 
 What colour are you going to paint it ? 
 Pink ! 

Can you make the tea , Sam ? 
 Yes , there is . 
 It ’ s over there , behind the teapot . Can't you see it ? 
 There it is ! It ’ s in front of you . 
 There are some in the cupboard . Can you find them ? 
 Hurry up , Sam . The kettle ’ s boiling . 
 What size ? 
 What colour ? 
 I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any . 
 Did she buy them here ? 
 We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now . 
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now . 
 They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes ! 
 I ’ m making a shopping-list , Tom . 
 We need a lot of things this week . I must go to the grocer's . We haven't got much tea or coffee , and we haven't got any sugar or jam . 
 I must go to the greengrocer's . We haven ; t got many tomatoes , but we've got a lot of potatoes . I must go to the butcher's , too . We need some meat . We haven't got any meat at all . 
 No , we haven't . And I'm not going to get any ! 
 I haven't got much . 

Do you want any meat today , Mrs Bird ? 
 Do you want beef or lamb ? 
 This lamb's very good . 
 What about some steak ? This is a nice piece . 
 Do you want a chicken , Mrs Bird ? They're very nice . 
 To tell you the truth Mrs . Bird , I don't like chicken , either ! 
 He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . 
 He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! 
 Yes , he did . He telephoned at nine o'clock . 
 I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! 
 No , he didn't ! 
 That's right . 
 Yes , of course . Come in . 
 I have lived here for twenty years . 
 Yes , I have been here since 1976 . 
 Because I have just retired . I want to buy a small house in the country . 
 6850 pound . 
 It's worth every penny of it . 
 Women always have the last word . 
 Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . 
 I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . 
 Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? 
 History . 
 Thirty percent ? 
 Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? 
 Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? 
 I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . 
 What ? Are you serious ? 
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . 
 But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . 
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . 
 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . 

I need a haircut . 
 No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ? 
 Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning . 
 Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style . 
 Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . 
 Fine . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair . 
 I don't know what to do about it . 
 Do you sell conditioner here ? 
 Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . 

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
 I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . 
 Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . 
 Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . 
 Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . 
 Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . 
 It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
 Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
 Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . 
 It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
 Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . 
 no , but I'm pretty good at eating ! 
 well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food . 
 I'm not really used to it yet . 
 like most foreigners , I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken . I eat them almost every day . 
 I tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . 
 that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food . 
 that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! 

Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ? 
 Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off 
 Can I write that down ? 
 Thanks . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year . 
 What are those stores ? 
 Even silverware ? 
 I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 Electronics ? 
 How much is the membership fee ? 
 I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things . 

May I help you ? 
 Alright . Do you have your receipt ? 
 And why are you returning them ? 
 I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . 
 I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . 
 I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . 
 Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment.Ma ' am , the manager says I can do it this time . 
 Please show me your receipt again . 
 I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . 
 We appreciate your business , Ma'am . 
 sure , what is it ? 
 in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon . 
 it usually goes to the dump . 
 ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . 
 well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home . 
 I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . 
 did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you . 

do you like cooking , Julia ? 
 how often do you usually cook ? 
 that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . 
 what kind of dishes do you usually make ? 
 do you make a lot of traditional British food ? 
 how about spicy food ? 
 what's your favorite dish to make ? 

I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture . 
 I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me . 
 most some drinks have too much sugar in them . 
 I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? 
 I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? 
 maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? 
 that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . 

do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? 
 I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? 
 I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! 
 I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? 
 I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! 
 first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . 
 yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . 
 that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . 
 I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 

are you ready for your first driving lesson ? 
 the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . 
 automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . 
 very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 
 how ’ s that ? 
 check your petrol situation . 
 that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 
 remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! 

Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day . 
 Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop . 
 I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . 
 Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . 
 You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . 
 Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ? 
 Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . 
 yes , you sent them to New York , right ? 
 what did you in mind ? 
 we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . 
 yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . 
 the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? 
 here you go . 
 are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift . 
 we've got plenty to choose from here . 

Come on , Let's go for lunch , Gregory . 
 Don't worry about it.It ' s on me . 
 I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . 
 Definitely . you know , I'm into serious sport in a big way . 
 come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime . 
 No , really , I think you'd like it . I adapted to it right off the bat . 
 I can teach you how . 
 No , not really , but I think I have lost my wallet . Where can it be ? 
 I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . 
 How about Karlis ? 
 True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? 
 I guess it is a little pricy . 
 That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . 
 Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 

Wow , Amy , look at that number . 
 What do you mean ? It's a scrim . 
 I love that kind of stuff . 
 Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk . 
 I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it . 
 I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week . 
 Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ? 

excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 
 that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? 
 can I buy stamps here ? 
 I need 30 for my Christmas cards . 
 twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . 
 no . 
 and the bubble wrap ? 
 thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
 I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend . 
 she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . 
 which one would you recommend ? 
 that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . 
 it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy . 
 she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . 
 no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . 
 no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . 
 that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks . 
 yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! 
 what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? 
 well , let's get a plate of those then . 
 I think I might have a dahl . 
 it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 
 ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 
 I think I'll have a beer . 
 I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . 
 what would you do without me ? 
 sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? 
 that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? 
 brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? 
 why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! 
 here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? 
 how about this one ? 
 ok , let's go . 
 don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? 
 that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . 
 that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 
 no , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . 
 if I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . 

it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! 
 that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? 
 that would be lovely , thanks . 
 I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . 
 well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient . 
 oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . 
 I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help . 

how is your house hunting going ? 
 how much are you looking to spend ? 
 looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . 
 well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! 
 I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? 
 how long do you want to sign a contract for ? 
 do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? 
 you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? 
 it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . 
 don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children . 

no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor . 
 oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count ! 
 ok ... sure . 
 You mean the large one or the small one ? 
 They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars . 
 No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? 
 Very well . Just take your time . 
 I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . 
 I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ? 
 Huh ? What were you talking about , then ? 
 oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway ! 
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
 Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . 

How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 

Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 

have you thought of moving at all Sarah ? 
 buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . 
 well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 
 sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 
 not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . 
 it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . 
 the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . 
 you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . 
 what kind of errands do we need to run ? 
 I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . 
 sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . 
 ok , let ’ s go then ! 
 for what ? 
 you said you were only going to window shop ! 
 I should have known ... 
 oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? 
 I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . 
 I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . 
 well , that's true . 
 she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals . 
 Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . 
 not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . 
 it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . 
 how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
 me , too . What did you have in mind ? 
 I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " . 
 the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . 
 I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
 there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . 

good afternoon ! Can I help you ? 
 this way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade . 
 of course . The fitting room is right over there . 
 I'm sorry . All the back of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ? 
 oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck . 
 our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . 
 let me see ... 
 I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? 
 Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists . 
 Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . 
 Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . 
 Absolutely . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . 

I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? 
 how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . 
 well , what do you have in mind ? 
 oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! 
 sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . 
 great . Let's go ! 

wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? 
 I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . 
 incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? 
 thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . 
 oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? 
 it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . 

What's wrong , officer ? 
 I did ? 
 I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . 
 I know that . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . 

I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . 
 I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
 That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me . 
 When will we know if they accept the offer ? 
 Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? 

Do you want to practice your driving right now ? 
 Are you buckled up ? 
 Start the car . 
 Take a left . 
 I'll tell you when to stop . 
 We're back now , so why don't you try parking ? 

Are you a good driver ? 
 I need you to teach me how to drive . 
 Yes , I have it . 
 I drove a car before , but only once . 
 I already know all of them . 
 When do you have time ? 

I have a parking ticket to pay for . 
 Yes , I remembered to bring my ticket with me today . 
 I didn't bring my ID . 
 What do you need my ID for ? 
 All right , I see what you mean . 
 Will everything be cleared from my record ? 

Isn't it past your bedtime already ? 
 It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow . 
 Try listening to some soft music . 
 I really don't care , just go to sleep . 
 You'll be up all night if I let you do that . 
 You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep . 

Do you have any idea what time it is ? 
 Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ? 
 Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late ? 
 It doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know . 
 If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . 
 Exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules . 

May I take your drink order while you are looking over your menu ? 
 The wine list is on the second page of your menu . 
 Yes , we have a full bar here . 
 Actually , we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas . 
 Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks ? 
 Would you like it with salt or no salt ? 

I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer . 
 I need help turning them on . 
 The machines take change ? 
 Where do i put the money in ? 
 That's it ? 
 Thank you very much . 

How may I help you ? 
 Everything on it ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Your total comes to $ 5.48 . 

Do you know how late it is ? 
 I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook . 
 Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? 
 Regardless , all you had to do was give a call . 
 Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . 
 That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules . 

I would like high speed internet installed in my house . 
 I'd like to make an appointment right now . 
 I would like to have it done this Friday . 
 Is it possible for someone to come a little earlier ? 
 How about Saturday ? 
 Can you come over at 11 

Can I take your drink order ? 
 The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table . 
 We can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar . 
 Our house special is our Cuervo Gold margarita . 
 Can I prepare your drink on the rocks , or would you prefer it blended ? 
 Do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ? 

What are we going to eat for dinner ? 
 I thought you were making dinner tonight . 
 Your food tastes so much better than mine . 
 You really want me to cook tonight ? 
 No problem . 
 Would you like me to come get you when the food is done ? 

So , what's on the menu for dinner tonight ? 
 You're not going to make anything to eat ? 
 I think you're a better cook than I am . 
 So you're telling me that you want me to make dinner ? 
 I'll cook dinner , don't worry . 
 I'll come wake you when it's ready , okay ? 

I'm so hungry ! Can you buy me a burrito ? 
 Please ? I haven't eaten anything all day . 
 I'm so hungry , I could eat a whole cow ! 
 I get paid on Friday , I'll pay you back then . 
 That's pretty messed up . 
 I don't want to go all the way home just to eat . 

I'm hungry . 
 Where should we go eat today ? 
 I never bought food from the cafeteria . 
 What do they have ? 
 Well , I want Chinese food . 
 I guess we can eat there then . 

Can you go to the store for me ? 
 Just a couple things , here's a list . 
 No , I think that's all that I need . 
 If you can , could you pick up my prescription for me ? 
 I think so . It should be . 
 Thank you so much . 

I'm starving ! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito . 
 I'm starving , as I didn't eat yet today . 
 My stomach feels so empty . 
 I'll be getting money on Friday , and I'll get it back to you then . 
 That's not nice . 
 I can't go home yet , because I have things to do here . 

I am absolutely famished . 
 Where did you want to go for lunch ? 
 I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria . 
 Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? 
 I was thinking about getting some Chinese food . 
 We can eat at the cafeteria . 

I am starving . 
 Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ? 
 I haven't eaten there before . 
 What kind of food do they serve ? 
 I have a taste for Chinese food . 
 Okay , let's go to the cafeteria . 

I want something sweet after dinner . 
 A dessert sounds nice . 
 I want to get some pie . 
 I have no idea . 
 Sure , what kind do you like ? 
 Oh , I love apple pie too . 

I want to get a snack at the cafeteria . 
 I may just get some chips . 
 What do you want to get ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 What kind of chocolate ? 
 I don't think they sell Kit Kats . 

I need a snack from the cafeteria . 
 I only want some chips . 
 What do you plan on buying ? 
 What kind of candy do you want ? 
 What kind of chocolate do you want ? 
 The cafeteria doesn't sell Kit Kats . 

Have you ever done your shopping at Whole Foods market ? 
 The food there is wonderful . 
 I prefer the food at Whole Foods . 
 Sons doesn't offer a lot of organic foods . 
 Yes , that's the place to go to get healthier food . 
 If you like Sons , then I'm sure you'll love Whole Foods . 

Have you ever shopped at Whole Foods market ? 
 It's very good , and it's fresh too . 
 I shopped there before too , but the food is better at Whole Foods . 
 Their range of organic foods is very limited . 
 Yeah , the food there is very healthy . 
 The food there is a great step up from Sons . 

What do you feel like eating this morning ? 
 The most important meal of the day is breakfast . 
 You can always make an easy breakfast . 
 All I make is oatmeal , toast , and some orange juice . 
 I like it , and it's a fast meal . 
 I can make it for you if you like . 

What do you want to eat for breakfast ? 
 You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ? 
 That's not a good excuse . 
 I just eat some oatmeal , toast , and orange juice . 
 It's good , and it's easy to make . 
 So , are you still going to have cereal ? 

I want to make dinner tonight . 
 I don't have any idea what to cook . 
 Can you tell me how to make it ? 
 Okay , but what do I have to do to prepare it ? 
 What do I do after that ? 
 What else do I have to do ? 

I really want to make something for dinner . 
 I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make . 
 I don't know how to make that . 
 That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? 
 What's next ? 
 What's the next thing I need to do ? 

I think I may try to eat a little better . 
 What do you eat ? 
 That's it ? 
 How is that the only thing that you'll eat ? 
 So , what about the chicken ? 
 That sounds delicious and nutritious . 

Have you ever been shopping at Whole Foods ? 
 They have the freshest foods there . 
 I used to shop there , but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better . 
 They don't have a lot of organic foods there . 
 They have lots of healthier food at Whole Foods . 
 Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me . 

I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods . 
 What foods do you eat now ? 
 Those are the only things you eat ? 
 Why aren't you eating anything else ? 
 And the chicken ? 
 I guess that does sound a lot healthier . 
 I have to start eating better too . 
 I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken . 
 That's basically it . 
 Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you . 
 I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat . 
 I know it does , and that's because it is . 
 I just have some cereal each morning . 
 I don't always have time to make breakfast . 
 What do you have for breakfast ? 
 That's a good idea . 
 It doesn't take much time to make ? 
 Why don't you make me some oatmeal and toast ? 
 I have no idea . What about you ? 
 I ate pizza the other day . 
 How about some burgers ? 
 What are we going to do ? 
 That sounds like a plan . 
 I think they sell both at the cafeteria . 
 What do you feel like having ? 
 I had pizza for lunch yesterday . 
 Do you want to get a burger ? 
 Think of something . 
 Let's do that then . 
 They sell pizza and burgers at the cafeteria . 
 What are you planning on cooking ? 
 If you plan on eating , you are . 
 What do you feel like having ? 
 That sounds really good . 
 I have no plans on cooking tonight . 
 I knew that already . 
 Didn't you just eat ? 
 We ate everything from dinner . 
 What are you going to make ? 
 Go make a sandwich . 
 Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? 
 Maybe you should . 
 You already ate . 
 There's nothing left from dinner . 
 What kind of snack are you going to make ? 
 You can always make a sandwich . 
 Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 
 Go right ahead . 
 What exactly do you want ? 
 What did you want to get ? 
 What kind do you want to get ? 
 I can tell you what kind I like . 
 Apple pie is my favorite . 
 See , I helped you out . 
 What are you thinking ? 
 Well , what kind of dessert do you want ? 
 Do you know what kind you want ? 
 Did you want to know my favorite kind of pie ? 
 My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple . 
 I'm happy to help . 
 I don't know . What do you want to eat ? 
 That's what I ate yesterday . 
 I wouldn't mind a burger . 
 We're going to have to compromise . 
 Sounds good to me . 
 We can get both at the cafeteria . 
 I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable . 
 Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ? 
 How would you like the corn ? 
 Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ? 
 That's how you want it ? 
 Okay , I'll grill some corn then . 
 I would like to get a double cheeseburger . 
 I would like everything on it , thank you . 
 Let me get some large curly fries . 
 Sure , how about a medium Pepsi ? 
 That'll be all . Thanks . 
 Thank you . Here you go . 
 I was planning on making some kind of vegetable . 
 What kind of vegetable do you want ? 
 How do you want it ? 
 I can boil it , grill it , or microwave it . 
 Is that really what you want ? 
 I guess I can do that . 
 You just ate . 
 There's no food left from dinner . 
 Do you know what kind of snack that you want ? 
 Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something ? 
 A PB & J is pretty easy to make . 
 Knock yourself out . 
 No problem . What do you want me to get ? 
 Did you forget to put anything on the list ? 
 Would you like me to go anywhere else for you ? 
 Has your prescription been filled yet ? 
 Sure , I'll go get it for you . 
 Anything for you . 
 Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ? 
 That sounds great . 
 May I get a large order of curly fries ? 
 Get me a medium Pepsi . 
 No , thank you . That's it . 
 Thanks a lot . Keep the change . 
 What's the problem ? 
 I apologize , but the cable has been down lately . 
 Give it a couple days , and it should be back on . 
 Since it's not working , I'm going to give you a credit . 
 You won't pay anything until your cable starts working again . 
 No problem . Thank you for being so understanding . 
 Of course , what do you need ? 
 Is there something else you need that you can think of ? 
 Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out ? 
 Is it ready to be picked up ? 
 No problem . I'll do that for you . 
 It's no problem at all . 
 What about it ? 
 The cable is down right now . I am very sorry . 
 It should be back on in the next couple of days . 
 We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down . 
 No , not until your cable comes back on . 
 You're welcome , and I apologize for the inconvenience . 
 What do you need ? 
 Right now the cable isn't working . 
 The cable should be running again in a couple of days . 
 We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience . 
 It'll be free until it comes back on . 
 Thank you for all your patience . 
 Yes , we really enjoyed it . 
 Yes , that sounds great . 
 The apple crisp sounds great . 
 Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? 
 Let's have four coffees , please . 
 Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here . 
 Our meal was absolutely perfect ! 
 Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends . 
 I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful . 
 We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks , please ? 
 We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas . 
 The hot drinks first would be great . Thanks ! 
 Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . 
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? 
 The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
 OK , I'll take one order of that . 
 Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 
 Yes , please . May I get a glass of lemonade ? 
 May I get an order of barbeque wings ? 
 That'll be fine for now , thank you . 
 Excuse me . I'm ready to order . 
 Let me have the baby-back ribs . 
 That will be it for now . 
 Yes , may I have some water , please ? 
 May I get an order of barbeque wings ? 
 No , thank you , that'll be all for now . 
 I'm ready . 
 May I have the fettuccini Alfredo ? 
 Yes , that's it . 
 Sure , I would like a Coke . 
 Let's see , can I get some fried zucchini , please ? 
 No , that's it , thank you . 
 I would like to order my food now . 
 Can I get a cheeseburger and some fries ? 
 That's all , thank you . 
 Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here . 
 I would love an appetizer . Are they listed in the menu ? 
 I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp . How is that ? 
 I'll trust your taste and take one order of that . 
 In that case , we'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice . 
 Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . 
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? 
 The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
 OK , I'll take one order of that . 
 Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 
 Can you tell me where your wine list is ? 
 Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant ? 
 Do you have any house specials that you could recommend ? 
 That sounds like a good choice for me . May I have one , please ? 
 Please bring it to me on the rocks . 
 I would like it with no salt , please . 
 Are you going to cook anything ? 
 If you're hungry , then cook something . 
 Tell me what you want to eat . 
 I'd like that . 
 I'm really not going to cook tonight . 
 Why don't you start cooking then ? 
 What are you planning on making ? 
 The only way you're eating tonight is if you cook . 
 I don't know . What do you want to eat ? 
 That sounds delicious . 
 I already told you that I'm not cooking tonight . 
 I already know . Start cooking . 
 Let's go get something to drink . 
 Do you know what you want to drink ? 
 You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty . 
 When you're thirsty , you're not supposed to drink soda . 
 Water is what's best for you . 
 It's better for you . 
 I think I'm going to eat a piece of fruit . 
 I really like apples and grapes . 
 I love green apples . 
 Really ? Why not ? 
 So , you like red apples better ? 
 I think green apples are a lot better . 
 How about we go and get something to drink ? 
 Do you know what you want to get ? 
 Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty . 
 Soda isn't good for you . 
 You should really drink water . 
 It's a lot better than soda . 
 Do you want to go get something to drink ? 
 What did you want to drink ? 
 Do you know that soda doesn't quench your thirst ? 
 Soda is really bad for you . 
 You're supposed to drink water when you're dehydrated . 
 That's what will keep you from being thirsty . 
 I may get some fruit . 
 I tend to only eat grapes and apples . 
 I've always liked green apples . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You'd rather eat a red apple ? 
 They're okay , I guess . 
 What kind are you going to make ? 
 I really like Caesar salads . 
 What kind of salad do you want to make ? 
 I love chicken salads . 
 That sounds really tasty . 
 I think that I will . 
 Do you know what kind of salad that you want ? 
 I usually make a Caesar salad . 
 Which kind of salad are you going to make ? 
 I enjoy chicken salads . 
 I really like how that sounds . 
 I'm going to do that then . 
 I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order . 
 I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce . 
 I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ? 
 I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza . 
 You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree . 
 Yes , we are almost ready to order . 
 Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ? 
 I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices . 
 I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles , please . 
 Please bring our salads to us now . We are hungry ! 
 What kind do you want ? 
 Caesar salads are good . 
 What kind do you plan on making ? 
 Chicken salads are really good . 
 That sounds like a great salad . 
 That sounds like a plan to me . 
 This all looks good ! I think we know what we want . 
 I am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ? 
 Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian ? 
 I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce . I would like the garlic sauce on the side . 
 You can serve our salads with our dinner . 
 No , I've only washed my whites . 
 Sure . Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes ? 
 How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash ? 
 It's really only a small load . 
 Not at all . It's no problem . 
 It's no trouble at all . 
 I've only washed my white clothes . 
 Is there any special care I should take with your clothes ? 
 Are there a lot of clothes ? 
 It's a medium load . 
 No big deal . I'll do it for you . 
 You're welcome . 
 The fare is $ 1.25 . 
 I haven't been driving for long — only for a few months . 
 Not in the least bit . 
 I never dreamed of doing this either . The only thing I like about it is the money . 
 It was really nice talking to you too . 
 I'll have a good day once this day is over . 
 It's $ 1.25 for this bus . 
 I started driving the bus a few months ago . 
 Not at all . 
 I never did either , but it pays the bills . 
 I liked talking to you too . 
 You're going to have to make an appointment . 
 When would you like the installation to be done ? 
 The only time we can come on Friday is at 3 
 I'm sorry , but we're booked up on Friday . 
 Saturday is perfect . What time would you like ? 
 That's perfect . See you on Saturday . 
 What kind would you like ? 
 You can get DEL or dial-up . 
 I would recommend DEL . 
 It's better because it doesn't tie up the phone . 
 DEL isn't connected through your phone line , but dial-up is . 
 That's correct . With DEL you can do both . 
 I've finished my white clothes . I need to wash the rest . 
 I can do that . Is there a special way you want them washed ? 
 Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed ? 
 My load isn't that big . 
 I can do this for you . Don't worry . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Let me just get five more minutes of sleep . 
 I understand , but all I want is five more minutes of sleep . 
 Trust me . I'm going to wake up . 
 I already know , and I'll take care of all that when I wake up . 
 I'll make it to school on time . Don't worry . 
 I really appreciate that . 
 Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ? 
 You can either get dial-up or DEL . 
 DEL is the best choice . 
 It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line . 
 Well , with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line . 
 That's right . You won't have that problem with DEL . 
 Give me five more minutes . I'm really tired this morning . 
 I get that , but let me just sleep for a little bit longer . 
 Believe me . I will get up and get ready in five minutes . 
 I understand , and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes . 
 I'm going to be on time today . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? 
 There is dial-up or DEL . 
 I would get DEL if I were you . 
 It's the best choice ; plus , it won't tie up your phone line . 
 Dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike DEL . 
 Exactly . With DEL you don't have that problem . 
 I'm so tired . Let me sleep for five more minutes . 
 I know , but just five more minutes . 
 I promise I'll wake up , in five minutes . 
 I realize that , and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes . 
 I'm not going to be late today . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . 
 I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . 
 I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . 
 Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? 
 I promise I'll go to sleep soon . 
 See you in the morning . 
 I can't sleep . I'm really not all that tired . 
 It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now . 
 That really does not work for me . 
 How about I tire myself out , and then fall asleep when I'm tired ? 
 Don't worry , I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while . 
 Fine . Sleep well yourself . 
 I really didn't mean to . 
 It looks okay to me . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 I didn't do that . 
 If you'd just give me your number and insurance , then I'll handle it . 
 Don't worry . 
 That was my fault . I'm sorry . 
 I don't see any damage . 
 I don't see anything wrong with it . 
 That's not my fault . 
 I'll take care of everything . I just need your phone number and insurance . 
 Here you go . 
 You don't know what happened ? 
 There was a truck on the freeway , and it flipped over . 
 I wouldn't lie about something like that . 
 I heard that a couple people got hurt . 
 The news said they should be fine . 
 Me too . 
 Nobody told you what happened ? 
 A truck turned over on the freeway . 
 I am completely serious . 
 I believe that two people did get hurt . 
 I believe so . 
 Yes , it is . 
 You haven't heard about it ? 
 This truck flipped over on the 210 . 
 I'm telling you the truth . 
 Two people were injured . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , they were lucky . 
 Did you notice that stop sign you ran through ? 
 You didn't see it ? 
 That's true . Those bushes are a problem . 
 I can understand why you didn't stop for it . 
 Under the circumstances , I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning . 
 No problem . Next time , just pay closer attention . 
 I stopped you for driving through a red light . 
 You didn't know ? 
 Don't you know that yellow means slow down ? 
 Why'd you speed up instead ? 
 I'll have to write you a ticket . 
 Here's your ticket . 
 Are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ? 
 How could you not notice it ? 
 You know.You ' re right . The bushes are covering the sign . 
 Now that I think about it , I can see how you missed it . 
 I'll let you off with a warning . 
 Don't worry about it . I need to have something done about those bushes . 
 There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for . 
 How'd you miss it ? 
 Those bushes are covering the stop sign . 
 I see why you didn't stop . 
 No , I'm just going to let you go . 
 That's all right . Make sure to look closely next time . 
 Are you aware that you drove through a red light ? 
 Yes , you did . 
 Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ? 
 So , then why did you speed up ? 
 I'm going to have to write you a ticket . 
 Here you go . Don't do that again . 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 Do you have some quarters ? 
 The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar . 
 The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on . 
 That's all there is . 
 If you need anything else , just let me know . 
 What do you need help with ? 
 Do you have any change ? 
 You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer . 
 The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot . 
 That's everything . 
 I'm here if you need any more help . 
 I started washing here about three years ago . 
 I can wash my clothes for less money here . 
 What reason are you washing here today ? 
 Go and get it repaired . 
 Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ? 
 Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money . 
 I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago . 
 It doesn't cost me as much to wash here . 
 Why are you washing your clothes here now ? 
 You should just pay someone to fix it . 
 So you're just going to wash here ? 
 It costs less to wash here . 
 I have been coming here for the past few years . 
 It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here . 
 Why don't you wash clothes at home ? 
 Why don't you just get it fixed ? 
 So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ? 
 Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way . 
 No , not yet . 
 I'm going to clean it up later . 
 I'm going to clean it . 
 I know . I'll do it . 
 I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then . 
 I haven't started yet , but I will . 
 I'm planning on cleaning it up a little later . 
 I know . I am still going to clean it up . 
 I won't forget . 
 My plans aren't until later , so I'll clean it before I go . 
 I haven't gotten started on my room yet . 
 I have every intention of cleaning my room later . 
 I already told you that I'm going to do it . 
 I'll remember to do that . 
 I'll clean my room before I leave . 
 Do you know what package you want to get ? 
 We have movie channel packages . 
 You can get the sports package . 
 We have that package . 
 Is there anything else you would like ? 
 You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day . 
 It's whatever you're planning on cooking . 
 No , I always cook . 
 Don't give me that . If you're hungry , then cook dinner . 
 Look , I'm really tired tonight . I don't feel like cooking dinner . 
 Thank you . I'm going to bed . 
 Yes , please . 
 Sure , what package do you want ? 
 We have all kinds of movie channel packages . 
 There is a package for all sports channels . 
 Yes , we do offer that package . 
 Do you want anything else ? 
 You can always get rid of channels or add some later . 
 Okay , what package would you like to order ? 
 We offer packages with all the movie channels . 
 We also have packages with all the sports channels . 
 We have that available . 
 Would you like anything else with your package ? 
 Yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Did you see if all the connections are right ? 
 The connections between your CPU and your outlet . 
 If your plugs aren't connected all the way , the computer won't turn on . 
 Why don't you try it and see what happens ? 
 Let me know if that doesn't work . 
 What's the problem with your internet ? 
 How long has this been happening ? 
 The internet doesn't come up at all ? 
 There's obviously a problem with your connection . 
 I can send somebody right now to fix it . 
 They'll be there in about an hour . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Have you checked the connections on your computer ? 
 There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet . 
 It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected . 
 Try it and see if it works . 
 It should work , but let me know if it doesn't . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 How long have you been having this problem ? 
 Does the internet come up at all ? 
 Well , the internet isn't down , so there must be something wrong with your connection . 
 I'll send somebody over right away to fix it . 
 They should be there in the next hour . 
 You'll need to make an appointment . 
 What day would you like us to do the installation ? 
 We're only available at 3 
 I'm sorry . That's the only available time . 
 Yes . Anytime on Saturday will be fine . 
 We can do it . See you then . 
 Are you having a problem with it ? 
 Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up ? 
 Will the internet even pop up ? 
 Since the internet isn't broken , your connection must be messed up . 
 If you'd like , I can send someone to fix it right now . 
 It should be no longer than an hour . 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 Try checking the connections . 
 The cords that you see behind your CPU that plug into an outlet . 
 If they're not connected right , that will keep it from turning on . 
 You should check the connections . 
 Tell me if it's still not working . 
 Thank you for meeting me here . 
 I need to speak with you about your daughter . 
 I enjoy having your daughter in my class . 
 She is a great addition to my class . 
 She is always behaving herself , and she's so smart . 
 I'm more than happy having her in my class . 
 I'm glad we're meeting today . Thank you . 
 I would like to talk to you about your daughter . 
 No , your daughter is great . 
 Your daughter is a wonderful student . 
 Of course not . Your daughter is smart and very well behaved . 
 It is my pleasure to have her in my class . 
 It's nice to meet you . Thanks for coming . 
 I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter . 
 Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class . 
 She is absolutely wonderful . 
 No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved . 
 You have nothing to worry about with her . 
 I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast . 
 I needed to talk to you about your son . 
 He was acting up in class one day last week . 
 He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class . 
 If you could , would you please talk to him ? 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 Leave the details of making the offer up to me . What were you thinking you should offer ? 
 It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? 
 Your offering price is not out-of-line . The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer . 
 It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer . 
 The only thing you should do now is relax . You already are pre-qualified for your loan . 
 Thank you for returning my call . 
 I wanted to have a talk with you about your son . 
 He was messing around last week in class . 
 Even though I asked him not to , he kept speaking out in class . 
 I need you to talk to him , if you don't mind . 
 Thank you . Hopefully I won't have to call about him again . 
 The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 There are two ways to respond . You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . 
 No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . 
 OK , I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . 
 By now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept . It will go quickly . 
 Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly . 
 I was calling about your son . 
 Your son was acting up in class . 
 He was talking and causing a disturbance during class . 
 If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it . 
 Don't worry about it , but thank you very much . 
 In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer . 
 Personally , I would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do . 
 I will contact the sellers with your current offer . 
 Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one . 
 I didn't mean to . It was an accident . 
 I did not . It looks perfectly fine . 
 What did I do to it ? 
 I really don't think that I did that . 
 Look , just give me your insurance and number and I'll take care of it . 
 Trust me . 
 I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . 
 They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer . 
 It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars . 
 Yes , you get to choose . I would spend a little more to get a really thorough inspection . 
 I am going to contact the sellers immediately . They were looking forward to your acceptance . 
 What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ? 
 They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like . 
 Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next . 
 I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it . 
 The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . 
 I needed to ask you a question . 
 How many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do I need to take ? 
 I want to get my license . 
 How many days do I need to finish the course ? 
 Is that all ? 
 That sounds easy enough . 
 I need to take a few classes . 
 How about a driver's course ? 
 I don't understand why I need to make an appointment . 
 I'd like to make one now if I could . 
 I'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9 
 That's great . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , that looks great ! Is it on our Open House list ? 
 Well , it looks great from the curb . Let ’ s go on inside . 
 OK , let ’ s go check out the kitchen next . 
 Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home . 
 Yes , it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand 
 From here , it does look like it could use a little work . Let ’ s see what the interior looks like . 
 Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint . 
 I think that we should check out the kitchen . It is listed as roomy and spacious . 
 The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . I think that we should go look at it since we are here . 
 Well , I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you . 
 Yes , please have a seat , and we ’ ll discuss this right now . 
 The counter-offer was acceptable to them , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . 
 It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars . 
 Yes , it is your choice as you are paying for it . Make a wise investment and choose the best inspector you can find . 
 Let ’ s call them right now . I am sure that they will be happy to hear that you have agreed to pay for the inspection . 
 I think that looks like a very nice house . Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses ? 
 I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway ! 
 That works for me . We can check out the kitchen next . 
 Check out the flyer with all of the home ’ s information on it . 
 They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market . It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand . 
 I have a question . 
 I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ? 
 I need to get my license . 
 How many hours a day can I do ? 
 That's all I need to do to finish ? 
 Thanks . I'll get back to you . 
 I haven't taken it yet . 
 I study every night . 
 Does it cost money ? 
 Does the test cover everything in the manual ? 
 Did you pass the test your first try ? 
 Wish me luck . 
 You did a fabulous job . 
 That's what I'm telling you . 
 You did mess up a little on one thing . 
 You had a little trouble on your parallel parking . 
 That's something that you really need to work on . 
 You're still going to get it . 
 Can I sign up for some classes today ? 
 I would like to take a driver's course . 
 Why do I need an appointment ? 
 Can I do that right now ? 
 How about 9 o'clock tomorrow morning ? 
 Thanks for all your help . 
 I would like to sign up for some classes . 
 I need to take a driver's course . 
 What do I need to make an appointment for ? 
 All right , can I make an appointment right now ? 
 Can I make it for tomorrow at 9 
 Thanks a lot . I'll be there tomorrow . 
 May I ask you something ? 
 How many hours behind the wheel do I need ? 
 I'm trying to get my license . 
 Can I do all six hours in one day ? 
 That's all I have to do ? 
 Well , that's a relief . 
 You will have to take your driving test . Have you taken it yet ? 
 Could you fill these papers out , please ? 
 You need an appointment . 
 Is Friday good for you ? 
 Okay , so Friday at what time ? 
 All right . Come in on Friday at 11 
 You did a wonderful job . 
 Yes , you passed . 
 You did mess up on something . 
 Your parallel parking isn't all that great . 
 You just need a little more practice . 
 You got it . 
 Yeah , sure . Let's go . 
 All right . Now what ? 
 Which direction should I take ? 
 Tell me how far to go . 
 Okay , but let me know ahead of time . 
 That was great . Thanks for taking me driving . 
 I'm pretty good . 
 Did you get your learner's permit yet ? 
 Do you have any experience driving a car ? 
 Do you know all the controls in the car ? 
 When do you want to start learning how to drive ? 
 We can do it tomorrow ; just call me . 
 Don ’ t be intimidated . There is a lot to sign , but I will explain everything to you very clearly . 
 All the papers have been drawn up , but I will need to see your picture ID so we can notarize these papers . 
 We are going to go through these bit by bit . You will have plenty of time to read the fine print . 
 We want you to get any outside help that you need . Do not ever sign documents that you don ’ t understand . 
 When these papers get processed , the house will be yours ! 
 I will tell you ahead of time , that there is a lot to sign here , but I will help you every step of the way . 
 Basically , what I need from you now is your driver ’ s license or some ID that shows your residency status . 
 We will be going through these papers one by one . I will be explaining them all to you , and you can ask questions as we go . 
 We do not want you to sign any documents that you do not understand . You may get assistance with any questions that you have . 
 This is the last thing you need to do , but it may take a while for the papers to be processed . 
 Escrow involves a lot of paperwork , but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along . 
 The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers . 
 Don ’ t worry about how many papers there are . We are going to look at them one at a time . 
 Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents . 
 At the close of escrow , the house will be yours ! 
 Yes , and I think I have good news for you . 
 Yes , they accepted your counter-offer , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . 
 It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection . 
 Yes , you are paying for it , so you get to choose . I would pick the best one . 
 I will call the owners right now . They will be happy to hear the good news . 
 No , I haven't . 
 I have been studying . 
 Do you know if it costs any money to take it ? 
 All right . Do you know if the test covers the whole book ? 
 Did you pass it the first time that you took it ? 
 Well , I hope that I do well . 
 The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you . What price were you considering offering ? 
 Let ’ s leave some room on this offer . I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market . 
 It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer . 
 The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond . They want to get things moving . 
 There really isn ’ t anything else to do right now except wait . You are already pre-qualified for your loan . 
 To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars , the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 You , of course , have two ways of responding . You can say yes or come up with another offer . 
 There is always a chance that someone could outbid you , but you could try one more offer if you like . 
 After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer . 
 I don ’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer . 
 Have you taken your driving test yet ? 
 Okay , first I'm going to need you to fill out the paperwork . 
 You'll have to make an appointment for that . 
 How does Friday sound ? 
 What time would you like to take the test ? 
 Eleven o'clock on Friday morning . See you then . 
 Do you really want to know ? 
 You did pretty bad . 
 You didn't pass the test . 
 There are a few reasons why you failed . 
 The main reason is the fact that you're a horrible driver . 
 You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks . 
 I need to see your ID . 
 You need to give me your ID and $ 27 . 
 Go get it . 
 All right , I'm going to need you to fill this out . 
 Here's a pen for you . 
 You need to turn that in at Window B . 
 Can I see your ID ? 
 I'm going to need to see your ID and $ 27 for your permit . 
 Make it quick . 
 Thanks . Now fill this out . 
 Use this one . 
 You're welcome . Turn the application in at Window B . 
 Do you have your ID with you ? 
 Well , I need your ID and $ 27 . 
 Please hurry . 
 Thank you very much . Please fill out this paperwork . 
 Here you go . 
 Thank you . Now turn in your application at Window B . 
 Do you want the truth ? 
 Well , you really didn't do all that well . 
 To be completely honest , you failed your test . 
 There were a number of reasons . 
 Basically , you just can't drive . 
 You can take it in a couple weeks . 
 If that's what you want to do , then we can . 
 I'm buckled up . What's next ? 
 What do you want me to do ? 
 How far should I go ? 
 Tell me before you want me to stop . 
 Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow . 
 Do you want to know the honest answer ? 
 You had pretty bad scores . 
 You failed . 
 There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass . 
 To sum it all up , you really just don't know how to drive . 
 Sure you can , in about two and a half weeks . 
 I'm a great driver . 
 Have you gotten your learner's permit ? 
 Have you ever been behind the wheel ? 
 You do know all the controls in the car , don't you ? 
 Tell me when you want me to teach you . 
 I'm not busy tomorrow . Call me then . 
 I need to see your ticket . Do you have it ? 
 I'm going to need to see your ID . 
 You can't pay your fine without your ID . 
 We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it . 
 Just come back when you have your ID with you . 
 Only if you pay your fine . 
 I've gotten a few . 
 I've gotten about six . 
 Yes , I've paid all of them off . 
 It's like $ 130 each ticket . 
 I got a parking ticket the other day . 
 I'm going to do that as soon as possible . 
 No , have you ? 
 How'd you get a ticket ? 
 I don't understand why you would do that . 
 Where'd you get the ticket at ? 
 What about your parking spot ? 
 I bet that you wish you hadn't done that . 
 Do you have the ticket with you ? 
 Let me see your ID . 
 You need it to pay your fine . 
 Because , I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are . 
 All right , come back and bring your ID . 
 Once you pay it , your record will be cleared . 
 I've gotten a few parking tickets before . 
 Only about five or six . 
 Yes , I paid my fines . 
 If I remember correctly , it's about $ 130 . 
 I got one the other day . 
 I may just go to the DMV today , so I can pay the fine . 
 Only a few . 
 I've gotten six , I think . 
 Of course I have . 
 I think they're $ 130 . 
 I just got a parking ticket . 
 I'm going to pay it today . 
 I've never gotten one . Have you ? 
 Really ? What did you get one for ? 
 Why did you do that ? 
 Where did you park at ? 
 Don't you have your own parking spot ? 
 That was very lazy of you . 
 No , I haven't . What about you ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Why would you park in the red zone ? 
 Where were you at ? 
 I thought that you had your own parking spot ? 
 Hope it was worth it . 
 You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods . 
 They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars . 
 Can I help you with anything else ? 
 You'll find that by the paper towels . 
 That's where it'll be . 
 If you need anything else , please feel free to ask me 
 What kind do you want ? 
 How many pounds would you like me to get you ? 
 Exactly what type of ground beef do you want ? 
 I'll get that for you right now . 
 Don't mention it , I'll just wrap this up for you . 

I need to buy a bus pass . 
 What are the different kinds ? 
 Could I get a student pass , please ? 
 Sure , here it is . 
 How much for the pass ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . 
 You are welcome . 
 Where do you live ? 
 The 264 will take you there . 
 I know for a fact that it goes to the station . 
 If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there . 
 Yup , it does . 
 It was my pleasure . 
 Where do you need to catch this bus at ? 
 I can tell you what bus to catch , but you have to walk a little bit . 
 The 267 stops at Altadena Drive and Fair Oaks . 
 Get on the bus heading west . 
 Del Mar and Hill . 
 No problem . 
 The mangoes are on sale today . 
 They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . 
 Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . 
 Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . 
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of citrusy . 
 They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe . 
 These are from Mexico . 
 I think it's running late . 
 It should be coming soon . 
 I can't stand riding the bus . 
 That is true . 
 Exactly.That ' s the worst part . 
 Yes , I agree . 
 I haven't gone to get it yet . 
 I don't know where to go to get one . 
 Where do I get it ? 
 I had no idea . 
 Thank you . 
 I'll buy it later on today . 
 It just isn't on time today . 
 I think it'll be here pretty soon . 
 I really do hate public transportation . 
 That's right . 
 Oh , that's the worst . 
 I completely agree with that . 
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 per dozen . 
 Yes , they're on sale today . 
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 We have a good variety . What decade would you like ? 
 There are six on this table . 
 Many people like the dancing figures . Two of our boxes have the figures . 
 That one will bring you many hours of pleasure . 
 I'm sorry , but if it breaks down , you're on your own . 
 When you buy a Model T , you can't expect a warranty . 
 Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . 
 They did . 
 Seventy to sixty-seven . 
 You still have time on your lease . 
 That ’ s not going to be all right . 
 I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit 
 Because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over . 
 You ’ re not going to get it . 
 I can ’ t help you with that . 
 Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls . 
 Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie . 
 Why , she's only $ 29.95 . 
 Excellent . Would you like anything else ? 
 The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ? 
 Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us . 
 Your lease isn ’ t up yet . 
 That ’ s going to be a problem . 
 It ’ s a problem because I can ’ t give you your deposit back . 
 You ’ re breaking our contract . 
 That ’ s not going to happen . 
 That ’ s really not my problem . 
 Actually , it is a 30 - day notice to vacate the premises . 
 This isn ’ t the first time you have been considerably late with the rent . I need to start the procedure to evict you . 
 This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent . 
 You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent . Otherwise , I need to find someone who can make the payments . 
 Thank you . I will need a cashier ’ s check or cash , please . 
 I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ? 
 How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ? 
 Do you need to be located in a particular school district ? 
 Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? 
 Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you . 
 The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate . 
 I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . 
 You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . 
 You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments . 
 Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check . 
 Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ’ s a 30 - day notice to vacate . 
 You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself . 
 This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don ’ t make good on your rent . 
 You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . Otherwise , I will find another renter . 
 Thank you . Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier ’ s check . 
 You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . 
 There ’ s a problem with that . 
 I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . 
 This was stated in our agreement . 
 I can ’ t do that . 
 That ’ s not my fault . 
 I can help you . How much money do you make per year ? 
 How long have you been on your current job ? 
 Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust ? 
 Do you know your credit score ? 
 By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars . 
 Yes , I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it . 
 If you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside . 
 You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new . 
 Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it . 
 The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom . 
 Let ’ s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home . 
 Would mornings or afternoons be best for you ? 
 It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you ? 
 Would you like to meet at the real estate office , or should I pick you up at home ? 
 We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see . 
 I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times . 
 We can figure that out right now . How much do you earn annually ? 
 How many years have you held your current position ? 
 Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary ? 
 Have you ever figured out your credit score ? 
 Adding in your expenses , I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house . 
 There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ? 
 What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ? 
 Do you receive any other income ? 
 Do you know what your credit score is ? 
 You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more ! 
 Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ? 
 Can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ? 
 Where would you like me to pick you up ? 
 I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take about two hours . 
 Once I contact the owners and confirm the times , I will e-mail you a schedule . 
 Yes , it has great curb appeal . 
 Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior . 
 The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments . 
 Come and see the kitchen . 
 Let ’ s go check out the bedroom and bathroom . 
 I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it . 
 Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? 
 There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? 
 We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . 
 I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day . 
 When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day . 
 You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . 
 The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . 
 Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . 
 Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . 
 The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next . 
 I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . 
 It looks like it was made just for you . 
 How would you like to pay for it ?

 I don't know , but I'm sure the produce person can tell you . 
 No problem . What ’ s wrong ? 
 Where is the pipe ? 
 Can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking ? 
 You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ? 
 Is that all right ? 
 I ’ ll get started on it now . 
 It ’ s my job . What can I help you with ? 
 In what room is this pipe ? 
 When did the pipe start leaking ? 
 I will need to tear down that wall to fix that pipe . 
 You ’ re fine with that ? 
 Okay . I will begin working on it now , if you ’ d like . 
 Rather difficult . How about you ? 
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . 
 That's because you did well . 
 Why ? 

Where is some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 I've never had a mango . 
 Can you eat the stone ? 
 How much are these mangoes ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 What country produces them ?

I think that I would enjoy living here , but I would like to make improvements . 
 I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet . 
 How much more would it cost to upgrade ? 
 Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment ? 
 How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready ? 

Thank you for coming . 
 I have a leaky pipe . 
 The pipe is behind a wall in my bathroom . 
 It began leaking a couple of days ago . 
 I know . 
 Not as long as it gets fixed . 

Can I ask you a question ? 
 How do you get along with the American students in your classes ? 
 Really ? Why not ? Don ’ t you go up and talk to them ? 
 You won ’ t get anywhere that way . You ’ re the one who needs to practice English , so you should make the first move . Besides , most American students are really friendly and outgoing . They will be glad to talk to you . 

Hi . Are you new in this class ? 
 Did you just arrive in this country ? You look a little nervous . 
 I took this course last semester too . Now I am taking it again ! 
 Wow , you have a lot of questions ! I learned a lot . In fact , that ’ s why I am taking it again . I get lots of practice in speaking , and also in writing . I ’ m sure you ’ ll be glad you took this course . I ’ ll even help you study if you ’ d like . 

I really want to take a nap . I feel very sleepy today . 
 I fell asleep very late . It was almost two o ’ clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep . 
 You know how it is when you ’ re in a strange country . Everything is new , and you get tired and nervous sometimes . Then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind . 
 Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap . 
 I don ’ t mind at all . You can ask me anything . We ’ re friends . 
 I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ? 
 Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting ? I didn ’ t even know you had a job ! 
 Yeah , I really know the feeling . I can ’ t wait to graduate so I can get a good job and earn my own money . 
 Sure , anything you say . 
 Don ’ t worry about it , just ask . 
 You need to know the type of shoes you want . 
 The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . 

I really think all Americans look alike . 
 But they do . 
 They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . 
 Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . 
 Do you have a map of the campus ? 
 Do you know where your classes are ? 
 That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here . 
 Is it anything like American football ? 
 I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like . 

Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ?

 I'll pay cash , thank you . 

Can you help me find a pan ? 
 I want a big pan . 
 Yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . 
 It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . 
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 
 Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? 

I want to find an old music box . 
 Do you have anything made in the 1920s ? 
 Do any of them have dancing figures ? 
 That's fantastic . I think I like this one . 
 Now , is there any warranty with this ? 
 I understand . 

I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter . 
 That's exactly what I was thinking of . 
 I like Macs . How much for a Mac ? 
 A Mac it is . I'll take one home with me . 
 I'll use my VISA , if that's okay . 
 Will she need anything besides what's in this box ? 
 I appreciate your help . Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff . 

I'd like to purchase a pan . 
 Well , I cook a lot of big meals . 
 Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy . 
 Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . 
 Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . 
 Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ?

 A big one would be nice .

 Yes , that's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 

I need a pan . 
 Well , the bigger the better , I think . 
 Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . 
 Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . 
 Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . 

I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen . 
 I've already got a small pan . I need a big one . 
 Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me . 
 Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle . 
 Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Cash . But first , I need a lid for this pan . 

Excuse me . I'm looking for an old music box . 
 Something made in the ' 20s would be nice .

 Oh , these are great . I think I'll take this one . 
 Now , does this come with a warranty ? 
 That doesn't surprise me . 

Pardon me . I need an old music box .

 I was wondering , does this come with any kind of warranty ? 
 I was just hoping .

I really need to go shopping .

 Yes , because I love yours . 
 Is IKEA affordable ? 

I have to do some shopping . 
 I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set .

 Is the furniture at IKEA cheap ? 

This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ? 
 I want to have a different color carpet . 
 Would it cost a lot more ?

I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you . 
 I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia . 
 We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom . 
 No , we don ’ t really care because they are all pretty good around here . 
 We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat . 

There is a problem in my apartment . 
 A pipe broke in my wall , and water is leaking . 
 Yes , it ’ s creating mildew on the walls . 
 I can call a plumber to fix it right now . 
 Well , you can ’ t do it until tomorrow , and I need it fixed now . 
 You ’ re okay with me calling someone ? 

I am interested in buying a house and need some information . 
 I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia . 
 We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms . 
 Yes , we want to stay in the ABC School District . 
 I would love to have a home with a view . 

I really like the apartment , but I was wondering if I could change some things . 
 I would like to have different carpet . 
 How much more would it cost ? 
 While I am at it , would it be possible to switch paint colors ? 
 When can my apartment be painted and ready to go ? 

I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment . 
 We gave you a list of problems last week . 
 Well , the garbage disposal doesn ’ t work , we have rats , and the toilet is backed up . 
 These things are your responsibility , and you need to fix them immediately . 
 If these problems are not addressed immediately , I will be contacting the health department this Friday and you will not get a rent check . 

I have an issue . 
 There is a leaking pipe in my wall . 
 There is mildew . 
 Why can ’ t I call someone to fix it today ? 
 I need it done today . 
 Are you okay with me calling a plumber ? 

I ’ m having a problem . 
 A pipe burst in my wall . 
 The water is causing mildew . 
 Can I just call someone myself to fix it ? 
 You won ’ t do it until tomorrow . 
 So , I can call someone to fix it ? 

We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment . 
 We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found . 
 The roof leaks when it rains , there is mold on the bedroom walls , and the dishwasher doesn ’ t work . 
 Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility . 
 Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday . 

Do you even know where this bus is supposed to go ? 
 Don't you know ? 
 Is this the right bus , or not ? 
 Where are we ? This is not Altadena . 
 Tell me what the street signs say . 
 Next time , I'll look for the bus myself . 

How do you like the apartment ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 That isn ’ t a problem . 
 What can I do ? 
 I can ’ t right now . 
 I will fix it for you . 

Do you like the apartment so far ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 That ’ s no big deal . 
 What do you want me to do about it ? 
 I won ’ t be able to do that right now . 
 Fine , I ’ ll have it fixed for you . 

You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment . 
 We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix . 
 There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen . 
 You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment . 
 I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately . 

Are you sure you know where this bus goes ? 
 What do you mean it should ? 
 Dude , are we on the right bus ? 
 It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena . 
 What does that sign say ? 
 Yup , I'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again . 
 Yeah , at least . 
 Good . How about you ? 
 Have you been on the bus for a while ? 
 Do you ride this bus often ? 
 You have a car ? 
 So why aren't you driving it ? 
 That's smart thinking . 
 I think we have a little ways to go . 
 I know . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I don't know . We may have missed our stop . 
 Yeah , we did miss it . 
 Sorry . 
 I think we have a while longer . 
 That's true . 
 I don't know . 
 I wasn't really paying attention . I think we missed our stop . 
 Yeah , we definitely missed our stop . 
 My bad.sorry ! 
 Yes , it will . 
 Yeah , I take this bus all the time . 
 It's about thirty minutes long . 
 There's a bus stop right behind Macy's . 
 There's a bus stop in the mall parking lot . 
 Absolutely . 
 Do you live in Pasadena ? 
 You could always take the 264 . 
 It goes all the way there . 
 Catch it on Altadena Drive . 
 Now you know . 
 No problem . 
 Yeah , it'll take us there . 
 I always catch this bus . 
 It only takes about half an hour . 
 We can get off the bus right behind Macy's . 
 Yeah , it's right in the parking lot . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 We still have more to go , I think . 
 You're right . 
 I don't think so . 
 Maybe we did miss our stop . 
 I'm positive that we missed our stop . 
 My mistake . 
 It goes all the way there . 
 I know it does . I catch this bus a lot . 
 The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so . 
 Right behind Macy's is a bus stop . 
 It's in the middle of the parking lot . 
 I know it is . 
 I need help finding a new refrigerator . 
 That Kenmore looks nice . 
 What makes is so great ? 
 What appliances are you talking about ? 
 May I take a look inside ? 
 It's very nice . I'd like to purchase this refrigerator . 
 You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? 
 We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . 
 Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . 
 That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ? 
 Oh , no . Everything we sell here is ‘ as is . ' 
 If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . 
 I would like to buy a new fridge . 
 I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 What appliances ? 
 May I see the inside for myself ? 
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 
 Do you know how many you need ? 
 We can get started as soon as you fill out this form . 
 You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass . 
 Very good . You can pick up your order in one week . 
 We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra . 
 No problem . How many are you thinking about ? 
 If you'll just fill out this form , please . 
 We can do that very easily . 
 Great . Your order will take only one week . 
 We can do that . It'll just cost you extra . 
 I need to buy a new refrigerator today . 
 I like that Kenmore refrigerator . 
 Tell me about it . 
 What are the appliances . 
 I'd like to see it for myself . 
 I like what I see . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 Do you have any idea how many you'd like ? 
 Would you fill out this form , please ? 
 If you detect any difference , I'll take you out to dinner . 
 Thank you . Your order will be ready seven days from now . 
 We can certainly give you faster turnaround , but it will cost you extra . 
 Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go ? 
 Well , that was an intelligent thing to do . 
 No , I don't . 
 You should just ask the bus driver for a transfer . 
 It's free ; just go ask for one . 
 No problem , just go ask . 
 I think this is it . Get off . 
 I have no idea . 
 It doesn't look right to me . 
 I think we did . 
 I really thought this was our stop . 
 Maybe we should just wait for the next bus . 
 Yeah , get off the bus . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 I don't think this is right . 
 Yeah , we did get off too early . 
 I messed up . 
 You want to wait for the next bus ? 
 Why don't you have any more money ? 
 That was a bright idea . 
 You know what ? I don't have any change for you . 
 Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ? 
 You know ? Go ask for a transfer . They're free . 
 You're welcome . 
 Why don't you have any money for another bus ? 
 That was smart . 
 I don't have any . 
 Get a transfer from the bus driver . 
 It doesn't cost anything . 
 You know what ? Don't mention it . 
 I think so ; hurry up and get off . 
 I don't know . 
 I think I was wrong . 
 I don't know ; it kind of looks like we did . 
 I'm sorry . I thought this was our stop . 
 We could always wait for the next bus to come . 
 Do you know what kind of pass you want ? 
 There are passes for a day , month , and week , and there are student passes . 
 Let me see your student ID . 
 Thank you very much . 
 The monthly sticker is $ 24 , but the actual pass is free . 
 We appreciate your business . 
 Tell me where you live . 
 You can catch the 264 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 You can catch it on Altadena Drive . 
 Yes , it does . 
 You're welcome . 
 The 486 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 It's about forty-five minutes to an hour . 
 Yeah , it's not that long of a trip . 
 It starts getting more crowded the closer you get to LA . 
 You're very welcome . 
 Which Sons do you want to go to ? 
 You actually need to catch two buses . 
 The first bus you need to get on is the 268 . 
 Once you get to Fair Oaks and Washington , get off . 
 You need to get on the 261 . It goes all the way to Sons . 
 That's it . 
 I believe you can take the 486 . 
 It sure will . 
 It's a forty-five minute to an hour ride . 
 It doesn't take long at all 
 More people start getting on around LA . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Where exactly are you coming from ? 
 Do you have a problem walking a little bit ? 
 If you walk down Fair Oaks to Altadena Drive , you can catch the 267 . 
 Make sure to catch it going west . 
 You get off on Del Mar and Hill . 
 Don't mention it . 
 You can catch the 486 . 
 I believe so . 
 It only takes 45 minutes to an hour . 
 It's a pretty short trip . 
 It only gets crowded once it gets to LA . 
 No problem . 
 Tell me where you need to get on at . 
 If you don't mind walking , I know a bus you can take . 
 Walk all the way down Fair Oaks , and catch the 267 on Altadena Drive . 
 You have to catch it going west . 
 You need to get off on the corner of Del Mar and Hill . 
 It was my pleasure . 
 Where is this Sons located ? 
 You're going to need to take two buses to get to that Sons . 
 First , you need to get on the 268 going west . 
 You need to get off on Fair Oaks and Washington . 
 Get on the 261 , and it'll take you the rest of the way to Sons . 
 That's all there is to it . 
 Can you tell me which Sons you want to go to ? 
 You'll have to catch two different buses to get there . 
 The 268 is the first bus you need to catch . 
 Get off when you get to Fair Oaks and Washington . 
 Catch the 261 and get off at Sons . 
 That's all you have to do . 
 I need you to tell me what the problem is . 
 Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? 
 Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? 
 Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ? 
 I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key . 
 Can you describe the plumbing problems you are having ? 
 Okay , the bathroom plumbing needs looking at . What about the kitchen plumbing ? 
 Has this problem been going on for a long time ? 
 I will be coming over to look at it this afternoon . Will you be there ? 
 I can always use my key to get in , but I would prefer that you be there . 
 What exactly is wrong with the plumbing ? 
 Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen ? 
 How long have you had these problems ? 
 I will send someone out to take a look at the problem . Will you be home this afternoon ? 
 Fine . I will be there around two . If someone is not there , I will use my key to get in . 
 I like it , but there is one problem . 
 The faucet in the kitchen is leaking . 
 That leak is a problem for my water bill . 
 The leak must be fixed . 
 I will not rent the apartment with that leaking faucet . 
 Thanks for understanding . 
 Hello , this is the property manager . How may I help you ? 
 What room was the leak in ? 
 Are you on the top floor , or is there another apartment above you ? 
 I will be sending someone out as soon as I can get hold of the roofer . Will you be home this morning ? 
 Fine . If you do end up going somewhere , we can just use our pass key . 
 Good morning . You are speaking to the property manager . 
 Was it leaking in the bedroom ? 
 Can you tell me which floor you are on ? 
 I would like to look at the leak . Will you be home this morning ? 
 Just in case you have to leave , we will just use the master key . 
 No , I didn't . 
 I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at . 
 Where should I go ? 
 I had no clue that I could get it there . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 I'm going to go and get it right now . 
 I'm splendid . How about yourself ? 
 So , have you been on the bus very long ? 
 How often do you ride the bus ? 
 You have your own vehicle ? 
 So then , why don't you drive it ? 
 Smart . 
 This is the property manager . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Could you tell me what room had the leak ? 
 Could you please remind me which floor you are on ? 
 I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out . May we look at it this morning ? 
 If you aren ’ t there , we will use our master key to get in and check things out . 
 I'm pretty good , you ? 
 How long have you been on the bus ? 
 Do you catch this bus a lot ? 
 So , you have your own car ? 
 Then , why are you on the bus with me ? 
 That's good thinking . 
 It should take us back up to Altadena . 
 I'm not really sure if it does or not . 
 I've never taken this bus , but I think it's the right one . 
 That's true , and we have been on this bus for a while . 
 Yikes ! Temple City . 
 My bad , but at least we know the right bus to take us back . 
 It costs $ 65 to buy a monthly pass . 
 There are student passes . 
 It doesn't cost anything for the pass . 
 The monthly sticker costs you . 
 Each month it'll cost $ 24 for a new sticker . 
 Let me go get it for you . 
 It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass . 
 If you're in school , you can get a student pass . 
 The pass is free . 
 You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker . 
 It's $ 24 for each month . 
 Okay , I'll get you one . 
 I didn't get it yet . 
 I have no idea where to get it from . 
 Well then , where do I get it ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 I appreciate you telling me . 
 I'll make sure to get it tomorrow . 
 Well , for a monthly pass , it'll cost you $ 65 . 
 If you're a student , you can get a student bus pass . 
 That actual bus pass is free . 
 The only thing you'll have to pay for is the monthly sticker . 
 It's only $ 24 a month . 
 I'll get it for you right now . 
 I don't think I'm going to get one . 
 It's just a waste of cash , man ! 
 Oh , really ? 
 Really ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I will . 
 I'm not getting one . 
 It's cheaper if I don't buy one . 
 How do you figure that ? 
 Really ? 
 I like that . 
 I'm going to . 
 I'm not going to buy one . 
 I think it's a waste of money . 
 How is that ? 
 Is that right ? 
 That sounds nice . 
 Yeah , I think I will . 
 I would like to have a hamburger . 
 I don't want cheese on it . 
 I think I'm going to get a soda today . 
 A Sprite sounds good . 
 Let me get a bag of chips too . 
 That's all . 
 The cereal is over by the breakfast foods . 
 It's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars . 
 Did you need help finding anything else ? 
 That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper . 
 Yeah , you'll find it there . 

What did you get for lunch today ? 
 Where'd you get your food from ? 
 What sandwich did you order ? 
 Was it any good ? 
 I ordered a sandwich there before . 
 Yeah , and they messed my order up too . 

Could I get some beef ? 
 Ground beef would be fine . 
 Four pounds is enough . 
 I'm going to need extra lean ground beef . 
 Thanks so much . 
 Thanks for everything . 
 If you go to the breakfast aisle , you'll find the cereal there . 
 You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars . 
 Is there anything else you need help finding ? 
 That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper . 
 That's where it is . 
 Let me know if you need anything else . 
 I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda . 
 I got it from the cafeteria . 
 They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich . 
 Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good . 
 Really ? 

What can I get for you today ? 
 Would you like cheese on that ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 What kind of soda would you like ? 
 Sure , no problem . 
 Will that be all ? 

What would you like today ? 
 Do you want cheese on it ? 
 Can I get you something to drink ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 Is that all ? 

I would like to get some meat today . 
 I need about a pound of ground beef . 
 That sounds good . 
 I also need three pounds of chicken breasts . 
 How much will the three pounds of chicken cost altogether ? 
 That will be all for me . 

I need to get some beef . 
 I want to get some ground beef . 
 I would like four pounds of ground beef . 
 I would like the extra lean . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I appreciate that . 
 What kind of meat would you like to get today ? 
 A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 . 
 What else will you be needing ? 
 The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound . 
 It's going to be $ 12.15 . 

I want to buy some meat . 
 I want one pound of ground beef . 
 That will be fine . 
 Let me also have three pounds of chicken breasts . 
 Can you tell me the total cost of the chicken breasts ? 
 That's all I'm going to get today . 

I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit . 
 I believe we are all out of food . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I would appreciate it if you would do that for me . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Go make that list . 

I really want to get something to eat . 
 I don't know what I want to eat . 
 Chinese food sounds good . 
 I haven't the slightest idea . 
 You like Panda Express ? 
 Maybe I'll go there then . 

I think I'm going to go to the market today . 
 Yeah , I think so . 
 I'm not sure what we need . 
 Could you do it for me , and write out a list of things that we need ? 
 Like what ? 
 Just go and make a list for me , please . 

I may go grocery shopping later . 
 I don't think we have any food . 
 What food are we out of ? 
 Could you look for me ? 
 What would that be ? 
 Would you please make a list for me ? 

I think I'm going to go get some food . 
 I can't decide what to get . 
 I think I might like some Chinese food . 
 I honestly don't know . 
 You like the food there ? 
 I think I'll go and get my food there . 

I want to get a bite to eat . 
 I have no idea what I want . 
 I wouldn't mind getting some Chinese food . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Do they do a good job on the food ? 
 I think I will get my food from Panda Express , too . 
 Sure . What's the matter with you ? 
 Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ? 

Are you going abroad to study ? 

I'm sorry for being late . 
 About what time can I go to my own class ? 
 Now that it is all over . can I go now ? 
 That's too bad ! 
 Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away ! 
 Thanks ! 
 No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly . 

Why are you so late ? 
 That's enough . Sit down . 
 Of course . 
 Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius . 
 B :: Come on ! I just took a glance . 

Good morning . I want to apply for a library card . 
 But I hear that the card is free . 
 There will be a refund when I return the card , right ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? 
 Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 No . 
 A little , but not very well . 
 2 months . 
 I'm a student . How about you ? 

William , do you like studying English ? 
 It's not that bad . If you talk to your American friends every day , you'll learn quickly . 
 Sure , what do you want to know ? 
 Laptop . 
 A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you . Do you understand ? 
 Laptop . 
 Yes , that's right . That's very good . 
 That word is pronounced kitchen . 
 Thanks . 
 Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well . 
 Yes , indeed . 
 She must be very sad . 
 At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . 
 Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone . 
 My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ? 
 I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese . 
 You are right . 
 I am in Nanjing University . I am a junior . 
 Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing . 
 Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies .. 
 I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me . 
 Before I work in the office , I was a teacher . So if possible , I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people . 
 Yes . You know , English is my present working language . Besides , I scored very high in TOEFL . 
 I will support myself . In recent years , I have saved enough money for my study in the U . S . 
 I will be there for three years . 
 Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus . 
 I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security . 
 Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus . 
 Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck ! 

What's your major in college ? 
 What research are you dealing with now ? 

Brad , wait ! 
 How come you have a locker but I don't ? 
 I had to carry my backpack with me all day . 
 Does it have a lock ? 

Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 . 
 Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports . 
 Mr . : For those of you who don't have a calculator , get one . 
 Mr . : Yes . By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . 
 Pretty good . Where are you going ? 
 Wait . We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed . 
 Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here . 
 Yeah . I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later . 
 No . That's not why I raised my hand . I need to go to the ladies ' room . 
 What's a hall pass ? 
 I see . 
 Or else I'll get into trouble . 

Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? 
 OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . 
 Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . 
 How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . 

Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ? 
 Have I used the one that my sister is sick ? 
 Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother . 
 Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die . 
 I'll do my best . 
 I'm working on it . Really ! 
 I advise you to take an additional course in some Chinese schools . 
 This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their Chinese . 
 Sure . You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there . 

Hi , Ann . 
 I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days . 
 Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . 
 I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio . 
 A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . 
 I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag ! 
 Yeah , maybe . 
 There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . 
 I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up . 
 You know that my father is irritable . 
 Good idea . 
 I asked you if you wanted some help . 
 Certainly . What's your topic ? 
 All right . You can use the computer over there , enter ' tropical fish'under subject . If you know the title of the book , enter it under ' title ' 
 You are welcome . 
 Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake . 
 I really wish I hadn ’ t done it . 
 I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed . 
 You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well . 
 I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught . 

Are you still on your summer vacation ? 
 When will school start ? 

What subject do you like best ? 
 No wonder your English is so good . 

How do you usually get to school ? 
 I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . 
 I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . 
 Do you have a car ? 
 Maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . 
 That's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . 
 I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! 
 Sounds good ! Let's go ! 
 Oh yes I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people and making new friends . 
 Well , there is one thing . 
 I am a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement , I have to do some cooking for them . 
 Well , I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking . 
 Oh , let's hope so . 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 In No . 4 Dorm . I like dorm life . You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook . What about you ? 
 I hope you will find a place . Listen , I'd better go . I am going to be late for class . 
 Take care . 
 What is it ? 
 Why ? 
 It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes , right ? 
 This is going to take more time than I thought . 
 Hi . 
 OK . 
 It's huge ! 
 There must be about 50 computers in here . 
 Do I have to take gym ? 

Are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus ? 
 But it doesn't look like a real bus stop . 
 How much is it going to cost ? 
 Is that yellow bus it ? 

Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . 
 Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . 
 Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . 
 Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . 

Mr . : Are you Mary Lin ? 
 Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher . 
 Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ? 
 Mr . : He's that guy in the blue shirt . 
 Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement . 
 What's a homeroom ? 
 Cindy , I'm scared . 
 Do we have the same classes today ? 
 Do you think the school can put us in the same homeroom ? 

Oh my God ! I can't find my first period American literature class . 
 Aren't you the guy who sat in front of me in our homeroom ? 
 I'm Mary . I can't find my American literature class . 
 It's 112 . 
 Thanks a lot , Brad . I've got to go before the bell rings . 
 I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room . 
 What are we doing ? 
 May I have a book ? 

Mr . Rogers ? 
 I'm not feeling too well . 
 Yes , I would . 
 I can manage on my own . Thanks . 

Excuse me , I ’ d like to apply for a library card . 
 What sort of proof do you need ? 
 I ’ m a student from out of state , so I don ’ t have a local driver ’ s license . 
 The phone bill ’ s in my name . 
 How long will it take to get the regular one ? 
 Okay.Thanks for your help . 
 How can I help you ? 
 Let me take your temperature with a thermometer . 
 I think you have a small fever . 
 You should've called in sick ! Next time , have either of your parents call the school office . 
 Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again 
 I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses . 
 Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies . 
 Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really . 
 She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy . 
 I guess so . What about you , Simon ? 
 Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer . 

Okay , let's begin . Hello , everyone . My name's Karl Roberts , and I'll be your teacher for this class , Intercultural Communication . 
 Uh , to begin with , please take a look at the syllabus in front of you . As you all should know by now , this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 . 
 Again , as you see on your course outline , grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test , periodic quizzes , and classroom participation . 

What did you major in ? 
 What is your specialty ? 

What courses did you take in college ? 
 Which course did you like best ? 

What courses did you major in ? 
 What courses did you minor in ? 

Did you get any rewards or honors in college ? 
 Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ? 

Do I have to take these books here if I want to renew them ? 
 That's so convenient . 
 Yes , but it was many years ago . 
 I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Medicine . In my country , that certainly has great prestige . 
 Oh.history . 
 Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people . 

Hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? 
 Fine . How are your term papers ? 
 How could it be ? They are due two weeks later . 
 Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study ? How do you do it ? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time ? 
 My advisor ? 
 Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? 
 Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . 
 Yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . 
 Of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . 
 Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . 
 Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . 
 Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . 

You can keep these books for only half a month . 
 Of course , you can . 
 I usually have the wrong notion that he's very serious . 
 No wonder when I pass your room , I always hear your laughter . 
 He'll never do well in mathematics . 
 Well , I can't help . 
 Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . 
 Yeah . 
 Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . 
 Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife . 
 Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London . 
 Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee . 
 Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky . 
 Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ? 
 Six months . That's a long time . 
 Intermediate Three . And what about you ? 
 I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ? 
 Only a week . 
 Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment . I'm looking for somewhere more permanent . Do you know of any good places ? 
 That would be great ! Thanks for your help . Can I buy you coffee ? 
 What exactly ? 
 In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid . 
 If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . 
 They will tell you the aid is impossible . 
 I am looking for a host home . 
 Well , at least half a year . Do I have to do my own grocery shopping ? 
 That is fine . 
 Well , I have been in a host home before . During my first year in the us , I stayed with a family . They are nice . 
 Well , that depends . If you stay for a long time . They will offer a discount . 
 I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning 
 I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . 
 You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts 
 Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . 
 Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . 

I really admire you , Diana . 
 You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school . 
 Isn't there anything else ? 
 You must have a high IQ score . 
 Go ahead . 
 Seriously ? But you are such a genius . 
 Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . 
 OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? 

You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship . 
 But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study . 

Thank you for lending me the book . 
 But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . 
 I doubt if I can pass it . 
 But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . 
 I must , if I want to pass the course . 
 Oh . 
 No , I knew it all along . He was the obvious choice . 
 A new broom sweeps clean anyway . 
 Yes . 
 The author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . He was born in 1911 and died in 1985 . 
 Can I answer it in Chinese ? 
 Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... 

How's your thesis going ? 
 I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . 

Who are we going to play with today ? 
 Oh , the basketball team from No . 1 College ? I know they're a tough team . 
 Who's winning ? 
 Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now . 

Hi , Jenny . Are you going to school now ? 
 Got any plans after the class ? 
 We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? 
 Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . 
 Well , that's a good question . I haven't swum for almost two years . I think I need more practice . 
 See you then . 
 I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? 
 I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . 
 Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . 
 Congratulations ! 
 No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it . 

We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? 
 While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . 
 Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . 
 Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . 

The summer vacation is coming . Have you any plans ? 
 I am going on a hiking trip . It's good exercise as well as fun . 
 So why not come and join us ? Lee will come as well . 

Hello , this is the International Student Office . My name is Leah . How may I help you ? 
 Ok . Can I ask who is calling , please ? 
 And what is your call regarding ? 
 Ok , I'll try and put you through . Please hold . 
 ... Sorry , her line is busy at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 Ok . What's your number ? 
 Let me repeat that back to you . That's zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , double six , double eight . 
 I got it . When should I have her call you back ? 
 Ok , Nathaniel . I'll have Ms . Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm . 
 Bye ! 

Professor , where's Canada ? 
 Can you show me on the map ? 
 Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ? 
 How about Connecticut ? Where's that ? 
 What state is west of Pennsylvania ? 
 OK , Where's Los Angeles ? 
 Where's Boston . 
 Where is Las Vegas ? 

Hello ? 
 Good morning . 
 Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . 
 Is there someone else I can talk to ? 
 Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . 
 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
 That will be fine . 

I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? 
 I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . 

Excuse me , can you suggest a good book for me to read ? 
 Do you have an English-Chinese dictionary ? 

Oh , Linda , you must be so excited about going to study in America . 
 Well , I'm sure you will . 
 What's the matter 

How do I apply to an American university ? 
 I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . 
 What's to come next ? 
 How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? 
 Thank you . I appreciate all your help . 

We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? 
 After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . 
 We plan to get together once a week . 
 We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . 

What kind of note are you taking there . That looks like doodle to me . 
 Does that actually work for you ? 
 I like to use shorthand note taking . 
 Hmm . I never thought about it that way . 

I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them ! 
 I hate this part of school . 
 I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time . 
 I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much . 

Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president . 
 We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . 
 Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . 
 Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . 

Hello , are you Chinese ? 
 I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ? 
 I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago . 
 I think it's just a matter of getting used to it . 

David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ? 
 Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . 

We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . 
 Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . 
 Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? 
 Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? 

I really like my debate class . 
 I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . 
 That's not like you to generalize . 
 I think I can do a lot of good for our country . 

I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job . 
 They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese . 
 It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up . 

Can I help you ? 
 We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there . 
 Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . 
 So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year . 

There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . 
 They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . 
 Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . 

I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? 
 Really ? 
 But some classmates said you took the money . 
 Look at my eyes . 
 Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . 

Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 

I've been looking forward to the new semester . 
 Hope so . 
 Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . 

By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 

I'm so nervous about this oral test . 
 I just want to get it over with . 
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . 
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . 
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . 
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 
 My poor memory . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , Ms . Jones . 

Emily , what kind of report is this ? 
 Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . 
 So what ? I got a ninety-nine . 
 Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . 
 I am 100 % certain . 
 I am sure I can get a 95 this time . 
 That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . 
 Yes , just once . 
 I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 
 I guess you'll have to wing it . 
 Nothing . 
 Just get out of my face ! 
 Leave me alone ! 
 I don't want to talk about it . 
 I blew the finally exam . 
 No , I'm not . 

Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? 
 Yes . 
 So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . 
 What if I don't know the title of the book ? 
 Could you give me an example ? 

I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members . 
 Of course you can if you like it . 
 There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . 

Is that Mr . Green ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . 

Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ? 
 Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? 
 How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ? 

Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? 
 Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
 That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester . 
 You can't do that , Jenny ! 
 Come on , let's talk about it . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time . 
 You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . 
 Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . 
 In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . 
 I bet nobody will care about it . 
 I'm sick . I think I've got the flu . 

I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . 

I'm frustrated . 
 I can't work out this problem . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . 
 Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . 
 You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . 
 If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . 
 Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ? 
 It is , but I can put you on a waiting list , if you would like . 
 Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As . 
 The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . 
 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 
 Which university should I apply to ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you very much . 
 More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . 
 I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . 
 I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing . 
 My dad was , but not my mom . 
 I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . 
 Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . 
 I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . 
 As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . 
 It's ok . What do you want to ask ? 
 The first place you should go is the International Center . 
 You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . 
 They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . 
 Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . 
 Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . 
 It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . 
 Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . 
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . 
 Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . 
 For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . 
 Yes , just over there to your right . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 My name is Jung Min . What's your name ? 
 Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ? 
 Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here . 
 I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . 
 Why were you in Japan ? 
 That's pretty cool . 
 Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . 
 Ok . 
 I register this Friday . 
 I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . 
 Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . 
 I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . 
 Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . 
 Is he an easy grader ? 
 Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? 
 Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? 
 Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . 
 Oh . That helps . Thanks . 
 Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . 
 Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . 
 Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . 
 That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? 
 My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . 
 I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . 
 Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . 
 I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . 
 You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . 
 Oh , hi Stacy . 
 I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? 
 So are you officially a junior now ? 
 That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . 
 Do you know how much they are paying her ? 

Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? 
 Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? 
 Did you register yet ? 
 What classes do you think are still open ? 
 That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . 
 He does that ? 
 That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . 

Did you already take the history exam ? 
 I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? 
 What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? 
 Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . 
 Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . 
 Thanks . See ya . 
 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 
 Can I check this one out ? 
 Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 It was great ! How was your year ? 
 Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . 
 No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it . 
 I'm feeling better today . 
 About more three days , I think . 
 No problem . 
 I don't think the exam will be very hard . 
 Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . 
 I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? 
 Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . 
 But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? 
 I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? 
 Really ? 
 Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? 
 How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? 
 So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? 
 Why did they want to found a college ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? 
 It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . 
 I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . 
 That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . 

Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? 
 Would you consider it your favorite class ? 
 What class was your favorite then ? 
 I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . 
 Yeah . Last semester . 
 It was Professor Johnson . 
 He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . 
 I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . 
 Are you enjoying the class so far ? 
 Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . 

Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? 
 Why ? What's stressing you out ? 
 The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . 
 I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . 

Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry . 
 What are you going to play ? 
 Enjoy yourself . 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . 
 I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . 
 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . 
 And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . 

David , what do you want to do after graduation ? 
 That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . 
 You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . 
 Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you . 
 Are you American ? 
 I come from America . Are you a freshman ? 
 Me , too . 
 Yeah . Anytime . 
 Sure . What do you want to know ? 
 Well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses . 
 It can be completed in four years normally . 
 You're welcome . 
 Oh , I know . When is it ? 
 What's on the test ? 
 Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam . 
 I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad . 
 Thank you . That's very nice of you . 
 Yes . Please give me your ID card , a photo . 
 Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit . The library card is free . 
 Of course , as long as the card is well kept . 
 You are welcome . 
 I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? 
 But I don't know how to play basketball . 

We have a class outing today . 

The teacher just canceled the test . 

Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 ! 
 Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? 
 You are so kind . Thank you very much . 
 Serves you right . 
 No . But I ’ m working on it . 
 I know . I know ! 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished . 
 Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me . 

You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes . 
 Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . 
 OK . Here you are . Anybody who wants help , please come to me . 

Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I've already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . 
 It's the end of the world for me . 
 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . 
 B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me . 
 I hope so . 
 It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . 
 Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . 
 My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
 It's true , sir . 
 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
 Well done ! 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories ? 
 Oh , yes ! 
 I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
 She's eighty-seven . 
 Thank you . That's a good idea.she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ? 
 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
 Thank you for you help . 
 Harry Potter . 
 Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . 
 Have you ever read this book before ? 
 It's really a good book . You will like it too . 
 Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? 
 Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . 

May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? 
 I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . 
 Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . 
 Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . 
 What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . 
 Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . 
 I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . 
 I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . 

I noticed your absence in class this morning . 

Can I help you ? 
 Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . 
 Here you are . You must return them within a month . 
 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . 
 No trouble at all . So long . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? 
 Then shall we make preparations together ? 
 All right . But I am very poor at math . Would you like to help me with my math ? 

Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Yes . Here's my identification . 
 Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? 

Excuse me , Miss . 
 I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . 
 Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . 
 In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described . 
 You'll get used to it gradually . 
 Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . 

I am certain I am going to fail my English test . 
 Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . 
 Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . 
 Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . 
 You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . 
 That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . 
 If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing . 
 From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . 
 Would you please tell us how to review our lessons ? 
 Any other requirements ? 
 Should we remember all the new words and expressions ? 
 Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems . 
 When shall we have a coaching period ? 
 Ok . 
 It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night . 
 Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . 
 The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills . 
 It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . 
 Study study study ! I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes , I ’ m going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it ’ s probably for the best . 
 Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yeah , sometimes . 
 Sorry , I can't . I am busy . 
 I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . 
 I help out at the children's hospital . I help plan activities . 
 Yes , it ’ s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles . 
 I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math . 
 I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare . 
 It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record . 
 I ’ ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow . 
 Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . 
 I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . 
 But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . 
 My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . 
 I'm a comparative literature major . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . 
 Even if the class is full ? 
 Oh , I didn't know that . 
 Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? 
 Thanks . 

Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ? 
 Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . 
 Yes , that happens . 
 Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? 
 Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . 
 Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . 
 Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 
 Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . 
 Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? 
 Really ? That's great to know . 

Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? 
 Alright . Do you have a coin ? 
 Heads . 
 Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . 
 No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . 
 Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? 
 Yes , I agree . 
 Alright . 
 Is that right ? 
 Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . 
 Are all lucky people so stuck up ? 
 Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . 
 I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . 

How can I help you today , Alice ? 
 Oh , good . You're an excellent student . I'd be very willing to help you with that . 
 What kind of scholarship is it ? 
 Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . 
 Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . 
 Do you have an essay you want to send them ? 
 What is the question ? 
 That's a pretty short essay . 
 Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . 
 Sure . What are they ? 
 I'd be happy to write one for you . 
 What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? 
 Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon . 
 Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend . 
 Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . 
 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 
 Can I check this one out ? 
 Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . 
 Are you Chinese ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 I want to study Mandarin and international relations . 
 They teach regular characters . 
 You just said your English needs work , yes ? 
 Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . 
 Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . 
 Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . 
 First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . 
 No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . 
 Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 
 So if you want to meet at 10 
 And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . 
 Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . 
 Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . 
 Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? 
 But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? 
 I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! 
 Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . 
 There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . 
 Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . 

You know ... I did very poorly on that test . 
 Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . 

Can I help you ? 
 Are you a professor ? 
 Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . 
 Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . 
 Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . 
 Yes . Or you can bring it yourself . 
 Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it . 
 Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request . 
 The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening . 
 You're very welcome . 
 Have you tried university part-time jobs ? 
 I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . 
 Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . 
 Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . 
 I have an idea . 
 Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . 
 Well , why don't you go and look down there ? 
 It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . 
 I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . 

Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . 
 Do you know about the Bucky Card ? 
 The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . 
 The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . 
 Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . 
 This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! 
 It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card . 
 But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . 

Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! 

I didn't see you at Mr . Johnson's class today . 
 Why ? 

Do you mind if I sit here ? 
 What are you studying ? 

Bonjour ! 
 I said , Bonjour ! 
 I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ? 
 Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed ! 
 I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job . 

The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... 
 Sure . 7 is B . Any others ? 

I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades . 
 She did last time . 

Maybe you should talk to the teacher . 
 You never know unless you try . 

You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself . 
 Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class ! 
 I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . 
 It serves her right ! 
 Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program . 
 I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ? 
 How do I sign up ? 
 Great ! 
 Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . 
 Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . 
 No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . 
 I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . 
 Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . 
 I ’ m majoring in French literature . 
 That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week . 
 Next Monday ! 

I wanna register for this mathematics course . 
 Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . 
 Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee . 
 She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . 
 Serious ? Only the proof of my address . 
 But it ’ s unfair . 
 Great . 

Are you planning on studying abroad ? 

Good afternoon , everyone . The experiment is to start at 3 . Have you gone through the instructions ? 
 Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know . 
 Have you turned it on ? 
 Ok , I will get you another one . 

This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? 
 Yes , please . 

Now let's begin the class . Who is on duty today ? 
 Please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ? 
 Well . Don't forget to perform your duty next time , ok ? Now , let's start our lesson . 
 That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . 
 Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . 
 Sure , very difficult . 
 It's my pleasure to talk with you . 
 Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . 
 I ’ m majoring in French literature . 
 That's right . We got the assignment last week . 
 Next Monday . 

Hello . 
 What's up ? 
 I don't know . 
 No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then . 
 That will be fine . When can I see him ? 
 Make sure you come here before noon . I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon . 
 By bus , of course . 
 Great . By the way , what does your friend do ? 
 Ok , see you then . 

How many courses do you have for this semester ? 
 How are they proportioned ? 

May I ask a question ? 
 What does mph stand for ? 

How is your new dormitory ? 
 Well , do you all major in the same subject ? 
 That's great ! 
 Oh , I thought I did a good job . 
 Anyway , I have to face the music this time . 
 Supervisor . Open the door . 
 What are you doing here ? 
 Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep . 
 Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration . 

Bill , your work is too messy . 
 Is this a promise ? 

I need some books on hardware . 
 Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? 
 I see.Thank you . 
 For what ? 
 If you don't know it by now , you might as well not bother studying . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 

I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? 
 I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . 

It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . 
 Which country do you want to go to ? 
 Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America . 
 There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . 

The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? 
 Are you sure you can do well this year ? 
 According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . 

How did you do on your BELTS exam ? 
 That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? 
 Do you know where the visa office is ? 
 It's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . 
 Sure . What do you want to find ? 
 Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . 
 Ok . Well , go to www.google.com , and type in Normandy Landing . 
 Here , try this one . It's a good site about Normandy Landing . 
 For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . 

I've been looking forward to the new semester . 
 Hope so . 
 Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . 

What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? 
 You are going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won ’ t you get lonely ? 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Would you tell me the name of the book and the author ? 
 I'm sorry . It's out of stock now . Could you come by again next week ? 
 Well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that I can inform you as soon as we restock it ? 
 You're welcome . 
 Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? 
 Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? 
 Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . 
 Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . 
 Definitely pre-med . What about you ? 
 OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! 

I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . 
 I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . 

Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here ! 
 Ok , I'm sorry . Are you the librarian ? Maybe you can help me , I am looking for a book . 
 I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes . 
 Ok , I would like to check out these books . 
 No . How do I get one ? 
 Here you go . 
 Ok , thanks ! 
 Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different . 
 Great ! Is your , too ? 
 That's a black fraternity , right ? So we should see some dancing ! 
 Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . 
 Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? 
 Sure . That ’ s not a problem . Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? 
 Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . 
 We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . 
 If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . 
 Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . 
 I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . 
 I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . 
 I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . 
 I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? 
 Do you have a lot of homework ? 
 Of course I do ! 
 I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . 
 Yes . Are you ? 
 Do you want to study together ? 
 Do you want to go to and empty classroom ? 
 Ok . Let ’ s go ! 
 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
 Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 It was great . I had a really good time . 
 Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock . 
 To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring ! 
 She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . 
 She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America . 
 Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her . 
 Yes ... with flying colors ! 
 It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! 
 I hope so . 
 not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , 

Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? 
 What was she like ? 
 What kind of things did you learn ? 
 Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? 
 You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? 
 I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . 
 Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? 
 Do you know what she is doing now ? 
 Have you ever read one of the books ? 
 Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? 

Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so . You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes.She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 

You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? 
 You sound relieved . 
 Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? 
 You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? 

In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . 
 Actually , five and a half . On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning . 
 That's too much for us really . 
 I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . 
 I'm going to register right now . 

Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 

Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ? 
 Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? 
 Which students go to private schools , then ? 
 But are the public schools good everywhere ? 
 Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ? 

Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression " goodbye " ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely . 

Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 

Are you studying here ? 
 What are you major in ? 
 What do you think of the literature course . 

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I am applying on it . 
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
 Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . 

What courses are you going to take next year ? 
 Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ? 
 Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ? 

Hey , This is your order . 
 Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . 
 Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . 
 No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . 
 Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . 
 Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? 
 Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . 
 Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . 

Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? 
 Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . 
 Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . 

What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work . 

Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . 
 Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . 

I passed history test . 
 And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . 

Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 
 That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . 
 And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . 

How is the college search going ? 
 But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? 
 I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... 
 I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . 

I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it . 
 In my opinion , you ’ ll make it . 
 No , I ’ m serious . 
 it's easy ! Just go and get a card . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? 
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . 
 What am I to do ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? 
 Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . 
 You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . 
 Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . 
 Will there be anything else ? 

Can I help you ? 
 I'll certainly try to help you.What topic is your paper on ? 
 There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . 

Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it.Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 A month . Don't forget to return them by the due date . 
 Bring them back to the circulation desk and renew them . 
 Sure . 
 Sure ! You should do anything you can to improve your English . 
 Of course it is.In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want . 
 Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration . 
 That's OK . I can get it from you later . 
 All right . I know a great restaurant near here.But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me . 
 Thank you ! I'll be sure to return the favor after our first class , OK ? 
 Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! 

Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? 
 Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant . 
 It was always very busy there . 
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . 
 Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . 
 Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . 
 Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . 
 Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine ? 
 What a pity ! I missed it again . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thank you . What shall I do when I check out these books ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two ? 
 Yes , but I don't think they are enough for me . 
 That's a good idea . Thanks a lot . 

What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? 
 I don't know . I failed my exam . 
 A B plus . 
 But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! 
 No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . 
 I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . 
 Thanks , bye . 
 OK , a moment , please . 
 For which one ? 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . 
 Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it . 
 3 Yuan , please . 
 You are welcome . See you next time . 
 Yes . So what else to do now ? 
 I see . How do you like the game ? 
 Who do you think do better ? 
 Exactly . He is unbelievable . 
 They were really tough . 
 I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . 
 Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? 
 I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ? 
 Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . 
 Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . 
 Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . 
 What's the matter ? Are you OK ? 
 Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . 
 You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . 
 In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! 
 That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? 
 Is the training center helpful ? 

Hello , 8520388 2 . 
 Hi , Maria , this is Shirley . 
 Hold on for a moment please . I'm fetching my textbook . 
 Oh , the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense . 
 Yes . You can use your textbook for your reference . 
 I don't think so , Maria , but I think you can look for information on the Internet . 
 Oh , there isn't such a code called economic law . The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws . 
 Yes , it's a general name for several laws related to economics , like Commercial Law , and Law of Central Bank . 

Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... 
 Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? 
 And when do you prepare for your final exam ? 
 Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? 
 Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! 
 Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? 

You are late again , Maria . The teacher is about to come . 
 Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking . 
 How about your one-year-old baby ? 
 How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . 
 When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ? 
 Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it . 
 I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time . 
 Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . 
 That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . 
 You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . 
 They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . 
 It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . 
 Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . 
 You won't be disappointed . 
 Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . 
 I major in Japanese . 
 It's very helpful.the course has let me into a world of literature . i read so many great literatures . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . 
 It lasts for 9 months . 
 The next beginning class starts on October 25th . 
 From 7 to 9 o'clock . 
 It costs 125 dollars a month . 
 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please.we need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . 
 You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . 
 One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . 
 He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . 
 Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . 

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I am applying on it . 
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
 Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . 

Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 How many credits for each course ? 
 Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . 
 Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . 
 I'm majoring in English . 
 Yes.The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . 
 I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . 
 You're right . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . 
 Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . 
 That's a problem . 
 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 Not always.Sometimes we don't understand her.Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Mario and I are the best students in the class.Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
 Sometimes it's difficult.Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . 
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class.She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 

Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Oh , but mine is a three-year program . 
 Okay , thank you . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . 
 You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . 
 Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely . 

How are you getting along with your paper ? 
 You should hand it in before next Sunday . 
 I believe you can do a good job . 
 Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . 
 They give me a lot of congratulations . 
 Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back . 
 Chicago University . My major is Economics . 
 Thank you ! 
 No . Only for a couple of weeks . 
 I am going to register at Harvard next month . 
 I am going to major in tourism . What about you ? How long have you been here ? 
 Well . You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay . At the moment , I am staying in a hotel which is far away from the school . 
 Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . 
 I major in Japanese . 
 It's very helpful . The course has let me into a new world of literature . I read so many great literatures . 
 Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... 
 I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . 
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . 
 Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I ’ d like to take English . 
 Because I want to study English literature . But I think chemistry is better for getting a job . 
 I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist . 
 How many credits for each course ? 
 Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . 
 Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . 
 Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . 
 That's a problem . 
 Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . 
 Of course ! Make yourself at home . 
 Please , just call me Tom . 
 Where's Cindy ? 
 Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . 
 What is it ? 
 It's huge ! 
 The craftsmanship is excellent . 
 Thank you so much . 

Mary , can you help me set the table ? 
 This is usually my chore . 
 We need to set the table for four . 
 That's right . Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you . 

I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . 
 I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . 

Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 

Don't talk too much , Tom . We are on duty today , we should hurry up . 
 Tom , your task is to clean the blackboard . 
 I'm going to sweep the floor first . 
 Stand on the chair , Pig Tom . Use your brain . 
 How about the podium ? 
 Be quick , please . Our teacher and classmates will come soon . 

School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . 
 I like science most . 
 Surprise ? 
 I do like PE , but I am interested in science . 
 Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . 
 Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . 

Daniel , would you like to have a look at my dorm ? 
 It is a small room , just for 4 people . 
 It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright . 
 Of course . They are very friendly . 
 We are on the 5th floor , and there's a very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , that's a good idea . 
 Let's give them a hand . 
 What's the problem ? 
 That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools . 
 This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English . 
 Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first . 
 No problem . 
 You mean the white building near the playground ? 
 That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books . 
 You know , our school is divided into two parts , the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . 
 Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . 
 I believe that you can make your dream come true . 
 Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? 
 Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . 
 The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here . 
 Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . 
 Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . 
 Sure , what's the author's name , please . 
 Charles Dickens ? 
 OK , do you know the title of the book ? 
 So , show me the note please . 
 Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ? 
 OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please . 

Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . 
 It lasts for 9 months . 
 The next beginning class starts on October 25th . 
 From 7 to 9 o'clock . 
 It costs 125 dollars a month . 
 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 At five . 
 Yes , they do . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , they do . 
 O levels and A levels . 
 Three or four years . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 That's all you need . 
 You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Yes , over there to your left . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now.Could you come back about 3,30 ? 
 Good . See you later . 

Can I help you ? 
 Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . 
 Here you are . You must return them within a month . 
 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . 
 No trouble at all . So long . 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes.She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 

You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? 
 You sound relieved . 
 Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? 
 You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? 

In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . 
 Actually , five and a half.On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning . 
 That's too much for us really . 
 I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . 
 I'm going to register right now . 

Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 

What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 

Excuse me.Where do I register ? 
 Is that the large , white building ? 
 Thanks . 
 Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? 
 You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . 
 I am worried . 
 My exam . 
 I feel very nervous about it . 

what do you hope to do when you finish university ? 
 after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide 
 if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . 
 that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . 
 I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . 
 I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . 
 Good . Thanks for asking . 
 I need help with something . 
 I am looking for a newspaper article . 
 I didn ’ t even think about that . 
 That would be a lot of help . 
 Thank you so much . 
 It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . 
 They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . 
 Yes . Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape . 
 This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . 
 It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . 
 According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What 

What book is that ? 
 Canada , china , and the use are huge too . 
 Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l 
 The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . 
 I want to check out these books . 
 I have it right here . 
 Are you sure ? 
 How much ? 
 I don ’ t have that right now . 
 I ’ ll do that soon . 
 I need to check these books out . 
 Here it is . 
 Really ? 
 How much do I owe ? 
 I don ’ t have that much today . 
 I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . 
 I would like to check out a book . 
 I don ’ t have a library card . 
 Sure . That would be great . 
 Okay . Here you go . 
 Here you go . 
 Thanks . Now I ’ d like to check out this book . 
 I need a passport . 
 When can I do that ? 
 That would be great . 
 What else do I have to do ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 Thank you . That ’ s perfect timing . 
 Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile ? 
 Fine . You can either park in the student lot or on the street . Do you know what a handicapped space is ? 
 Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? 
 Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . Have you seen those signs ? 
 The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days . Do you know how to read the curb colors ? 
 Well , just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading , I think you know what you need to know . 
 No problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done . 
 That looks great , but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I . D . 
 Well , this looks nice . Do you know how to use it ? 
 Of course , just remember that all of the needed information is on the card . 
 Well , I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits ! 
 Is this absolutely necessary ? 
 Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? 
 Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . 
 Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? 
 Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester ! 
 Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? 
 Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ? 
 You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ? 
 Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . 
 Well , have a good day off from class . 
 No problem , what class would you like to take ? 
 There are two classes that are still open . 
 The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three . 
 The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12 . 
 I'm positive . 
 Okay , I'll sign you up . 
 We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next Monday . Do you have something to write that down on ? 
 That will be on the second of December . Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . Do you understand ? 
 The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th . Is someone coming to get you ? 
 We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.m.Any more questions . 
 I put all of that information in the packet . I'll give you another copy if you need one . See you on Monday ! 
 What class are you trying to take ? 
 Well , there are only two classes open . 
 One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 . 
 That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday . 
 Yes , I am sure . 
 Very well then . 
 Do you know what class you want to take ? 
 I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . 
 There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . 
 It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday . 
 These two are the only ones . 
 Very good . 
 Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? 
 Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . 
 Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other . 

Could you help me ? 
 I can't seem to find my class . 
 It's in the C building . 
 Do you think you can tell me where it is ? 
 It's room number 261 . 
 Could you show me where it is ? 

My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . 
 The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . 
 That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . 
 That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? 

I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it . 
 Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion . 
 There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all . 
 That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . 
 It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . 
 I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . 
 No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . 
 You said it . 
 I think I'm making good progress . 
 At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . 
 What is it ? Maybe I can help . 
 Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? 
 It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . 
 Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . 
 Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . 
 Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . 
 In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . 
 A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? 
 Exactly . 
 They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . 
 Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . 
 I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! 
 I don ’ t know . What do you think ? 
 What do natives get ? 
 Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? 
 I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . 

Do you mind if I ask you a question ? 
 What do you do in order to improve your English ? 
 It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? 
 It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? 

Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? 
 So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? 
 How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . 
 It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... 
 I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . 
 You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! 
 So you're learning Chinese songs ? 
 That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? 
 It makes sense . 
 Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . 
 Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? 
 Ok . I will bring it with me . 
 Well , pretty good . 
 Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . 
 That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . 
 And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . 
 Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . 
 I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . 

Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? 
 Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! 
 No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . 
 But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? 
 Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? 
 The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . 
 That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . 
 For more than five years . 
 It's no picnic . 
 Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . 
 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... 
 Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
 Yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
 I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . 
 Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 
 Oh , I'm shocked . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . 
 Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . 
 I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . 
 Exactly . 
 Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
 Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . 
 He asked me how long it took me to learn English . 
 Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . 
 You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . 
 I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . 
 Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . 
 He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . 

You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . 
 That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . 
 Is it true or isn ’ t it ? 
 I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . 
 OK , go on . 
 Not exactly , but I see your point . 

What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work . 

Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! 
 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
 Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . 
 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 You hit the nail right on the head . 
 What is it ? 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 
 Ok , cool . 
 No problem . 

Are you studying any languages here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 Do you know anything about Britain and America ? 
 Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 

Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . 

Here's the course description guide . 
 Do you want me to help you ? 
 Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them . 
 You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... 
 Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Tell me which building it's in . 
 I know where the C building is . 
 Of course , which room number is it ? 
 I actually have a class right around there . 
 I can do that . 
 Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . 
 Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . 
 Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . 
 I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . 
 I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . 
 Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Do you know what building that it's in ? 
 Well , that's not far away . 
 Do you know what the room number is ? 
 My next class is around there . 
 Sure , let's go . 
 Do you have your book list for your class ? 
 Fine . Once you have it , you can go to the bookstore . Do you know where that is ? 
 OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? 
 You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ? 
 Well , if you decide to go , I could meet you over there at 1 
 Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day ! 
 First , you need to have the list of books for your class . Do you have that ? 
 Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ? 
 Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left . Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ? 
 Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ? 
 I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1 
 I'll see you later then . Have a great day ! 
 Did you come late ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , okay . Well , here you go . 
 Oh , wait , here are the rest . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? 
 Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat . 
 It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ? 
 This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . 
 Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a . m . in the morning . Can you mark that on your calendar ? 
 That will be Monday , December 2nd . We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 . 
 We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ? 
 The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p . m . 
 I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday ! 
 Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ? 
 I have a great idea of where you might like to go . 
 It's on the second floor . May I join you ? 
 Let's hurry . I'm starving ! 
 Sure ! What kind of food would you like ? 
 I know the perfect place ! 
 It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ? 
 Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! 
 There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ? 
 To get started , take that list over to the bookstore . Do you know where the bookstore is ? 
 When you pass the gym , it'll be the first door on the left . Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? 
 If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door , he will reimburse you . Can you go over there today ? 
 I am free at 1 
 I'll catch you later then . Have a wonderful morning . 
 Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? 
 OK . So this machine will make change if you need it . Do you have your dollars ready ? 
 Next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . Make sure they are smooth . 
 I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck , you might have to re-feed it . 
 Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . 
 Well , good luck ! 
 Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? 
 OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . 
 First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . 
 Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . 
 Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . 
 Hope that works for you ! 
 Off campus or on campus ? 
 Why don't you park in the parking structure for students ? 
 It's on the west side of the campus . 
 It was empty last time I went up there . 
 I went up there early this morning . 
 It might be . You'll have to go see for yourself . 
 Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . 
 I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . 
 Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? 
 Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout . 
 Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library . 
 Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? 
 Are you ready to go ? 
 The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in . 
 Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . 
 Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . 
 You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! 
 Are you looking for a space on or off campus ? 
 You can park in the student parking structure . 
 You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus . 
 Last time I checked , it was pretty empty . 
 That was earlier this morning . 
 I have no idea . 
 Sure , let me give you an application . You can fill it out right here at the counter . 
 Let me take a look at this for you . May I have your driver's license , please ? 
 You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ? 
 The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout . 
 Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you . 
 Do you need a spot here or off campus ? 
 There's a parking structure for students . 
 Go to the western side of the campus , and you'll find it there . 
 When I went up there , it wasn't full at all . 
 Sometime this morning . 
 I am really not sure . 
 I want to return this video . 
 I also need to check these books out . 
 That ’ s everything . 
 I have it . Here you go . 
 That ’ s everything . 
 Thank you . Good night . 
 I am trying to find this book . 
 It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . 
 I have already . 
 It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . 
 You can do that ? 
 That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I want to check this magazine out . 
 Why not ? 
 So what am I allowed to check out ? 
 I need to check out this magazine . 
 That doesn ’ t make any sense . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I would also like to check out these books . 
 That ’ s it . 
 Oh , yeah . Here you go . 
 That ’ ll be all . 
 Thanks . Have a good one . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I want to check these books out . 
 That ’ s all . 
 It ’ s right here . 
 Yes . That ’ s it . 
 All right . Have a good night . 
 I want to return this video . 
 I also need to check this magazine out . 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 What can I check out ? 
 I need this magazine . 
 That ’ s weird . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I would also like to check out this video . 
 Yes , just the video . 
 Here you go . 
 Oh , I will . 
 I understand . Thank you very much . 
 Were you here last week ? 
 How come ? 
 Well , here are the notes . 
 Sorry , here you go . 
 No problem . 
 Yeah , sure , you didn't come to class that day ? 
 Why not ? 
 Here they are . 
 Oh , no , this is the rest . 
 It's no problem at all . 
 What happened that you didn't get it done ? 
 Well , you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ? 
 Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ? 
 Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class . 
 Remember that you are in college now , not high school . 
 Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ? 
 He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ? 
 He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ? 
 What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ? 
 Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ? 
 Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck ! 
 I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? 
 I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? 
 Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor . 
 If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way . 
 If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call ! 
 You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? 
 But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? 
 You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? 
 That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? 
 Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . 
 OK , go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time ? 
 Could you have gotten it done at another time ? 
 You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up ? 
 That would work , but don't let it happen again . 
 That will solve it then . Let's work hard to not let it happen again . 
 Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ? 
 How are you going to catch up ? 
 If you miss this class , you will have used up your quota for the semester . 
 Make sure to remind me right before you are absent . 
 Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study ! 
 Yes . Are you in his class ? 
 He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? 
 I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? 
 Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? 
 Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? 
 We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . 
 Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ? 
 He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? 
 Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? 
 He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? 
 Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? 
 I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! 
 I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind ? 
 Fine , do you know where my office is ? 
 Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor . 
 Don't worry , it will work out fine once you get there . I'll see you then . 
 Looking forward to meeting with you ! 
 You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ? 
 You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? 
 The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be . 
 You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . 
 To drop a class , you need to do the same thing with a drop slip . Good luck ! 
 What is the problem ? 
 Are you planning on having someone take notes for you ? 
 When , exactly do you need to leave ? 
 Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again . 
 See you later ! Drive carefully . 
 I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? 
 After I sign it , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? 
 When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line . 
 It should be easy to find . After you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . 
 Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! 
 The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? 
 Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 
 You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ? 
 To get back to campus by 8 
 All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! 
 Why do you have to leave early ? 
 Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ? 
 Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ? 
 OK , but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed . 
 Go do what you have to do , but make sure it doesn't happen again . 
 Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? 
 When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? 
 Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? 
 You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . 
 Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! 
 Do you have a car or motorbike ? 
 In that case , you can park either in a student lot or on the street . Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots ? 
 The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? 
 Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ? 
 Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . Do you know what the curb colors mean ? 
 Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . I think you'll be good to go ! 
 Where do you need to be that is more important than school ? 
 Do you have a plan to make up your missed work ? 
 Are you going to go right away ? 
 All right , but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up . 
 Goodbye , and try not to miss any more school . 
 What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ? 
 OK . That means you can park in the student lot or on the street . Have you seen the handicapped spots ? 
 Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces . Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? 
 Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? 
 As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? 
 If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . 
 Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ? 
 Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ? 
 OK , that will be twenty-five dollars . How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ? 
 Here you go then . Have a great school year ! 
 What can I help you with ? 
 What is it ? 
 I can understand the problem with that . 
 No problem , do you want those classes still ? 
 Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day . 

I'll need a parking permit for next semester . 
 I only attend class part-time in the evenings . 
 I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school . 
 I'll pay cash . 
 No , thank you . 

I want to buy a parking permit , please . 
 I attend both day and evening classes . 
 I ride a motorcycle . 
 I'll use a credit card , thank you . 
 No , just the motorcycle permit . 

I'm here for my appointment . 
 I have an issue with my schedule . 
 I have two classes on here that are at the same time . 
 Can you change that for me ? 
 Yes , I would like to keep both classes . 
 I would greatly appreciate that . 
 I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? 
 Great , do you need directions to my office ? 
 Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . 
 It's very easy to find . 
 I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week ! 
 Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Well , I can see that's a problem . 
 Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? 
 Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . 

Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score . 
 I think that the percentage is incorrect . 
 Sure , let's do it . 
 I don't see any mistakes . 
 Yes , let's total it . 
 Yes , you're right . 

I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . 
 I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . 
 That would be great ! 
 This one right here should be right . 
 Yeah , let's do the math . 
 Looks pretty good . 

Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong . 
 Both . 
 Yeah , I'm ready . 
 These look strange . 
 OK , let's do the calculation . 
 I see . 

I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . 
 What counts the most ? 
 Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? 
 What if we miss something ? 
 Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? 

What do you base our grades on ? 
 Does the final count the most ? 
 How do you total our scores ? 
 What if we are out sick ? 
 How can we know if we are doing OK during the year ? 

I'd like to talk to you about my grades . 
 I am worried that I messed up on a test . 
 I think I am doing great , except for that one test ! 
 I think that I could study a little harder for tests . 
 Yes , I know . 

What can I help you with today ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Would you like to apply for one right now ? 
 I ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . 
 All right , now please sign the back of the card . 
 That ’ s all there is to it . 

How do you decide what grade we get ? 
 What is the most important factor ? 
 How can we keep track of our grades ? 
 What if we can't get to school ? 
 If we have a major problem , will you let us know ? 

Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ? 
 I want to know if I am doing OK . 
 I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well . 
 I think I could take better notes and read a little more . 
 I'm working on it ! 

Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? 
 Am I failing ? 
 I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . 
 I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . 
 I'll try ; it's hard ! 

May I help you ? 
 Let me see your library card . 
 You can apply for one right now , if you ’ d like . 
 Could you fill out this application ? 
 Could you please sign the back of the card ? 
 That ’ s it . 

What can I do for you ? 
 Let me have them . 
 These books are two weeks late . 
 You ’ re going to have to pay late fees . 
 25 cents a day . 
 That means 25 cents for each late book . 

May I help you with something ? 
 I ’ ll take them . 
 These books were due two weeks ago . 
 You will need to pay late fees on these books . 
 The fee is 25 cents every day . 
 And that ’ s for each book that is late . 

How may I help you ? 
 What happened to this one ? 
 You ’ re going to need to pay for the damage . 
 It ’ s going to be $ 5 . 
 It really isn ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . 

May I help you with something ? 
 What happened to this book ? 
 I ’ m going to have to charge you for the damage . 
 It ’ s only $ 5 . 
 I know it ’ s not . 
 Thank you for your payment . 

What can I do for you ? 
 What did you do to this book ? 
 You will need to pay for the damage . 
 I ’ m going to need $ 5.00 . 
 It isn ’ t . 
 Thank you . 

May I help you ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 You should look it up on our computer . 
 What came up ? 
 I can try to get the book from a different library . 
 I will call you when I find it . 

What can I do for you ? 
 Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf ? 
 Is it on the shelf ? 
 Apparently somebody took that book out of the library . 
 We will definitely be getting another . 
 That won ’ t be a problem . 

How may I help you ? 
 Have you checked the database ? 
 Was it on the shelf ? 
 Maybe someone took it . 
 I ’ m sure we will . 
 I sure will . 

How may I help you ? 
 Give them here . 
 It appears these books are two weeks late . 
 You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees , right ? 
 The late fee is 25 cents a day . 
 It ’ s 25 cents for each book . 

May I help you ? 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 This is all you want to check out ? 
 I ’ m going to need your library card . 
 You ’ ll need to take care of the video . 
 We will fine you if you damage it . 

May I help you ? 
 Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ? 
 Do we have it available ? 
 I guess it is lost . 
 Yes , we will . 
 I can do that . 

How may I help you ? 
 You need to apply for a passport . 
 You can apply right now . 
 Fill this out , please . 
 I will need to take your passport picture . 
 It will take about three weeks . 

Do you need help with something ? 
 Is there something wrong ? 
 Did you check the computer ?

what do you think of studying abroad ? 
 yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now . 
 I'd like to study in the UK , but it's really expensive . 
 yes , I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago . 
 I have to get an BELTS score of 7.5 overall . Do you think I can do that ? 
 I was also accepted into Yale University , and Sydney University . 
 I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make . 

how did you do on your BELTS exam ? 
 that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? 
 do you know where the visa office is ? 
 it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . 
 have you ever gone abroad before ? 
 have you ever been denied a visa before ? 
 that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ? 
 that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ? 
 I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . 

you look better today . How did your test go ? 
 did you pass ? 
 you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . 
 you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . 
 no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . 
 sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? 
 when do you plan on studying for those exams ? 
 do you think that's a good idea ? 
 that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? 
 it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! 
 I hate school ! 
 I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! 
 yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed ! 
 I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank . 
 no ... 
 I watched TV . 
 no , not really . 
 tomorrow . 

hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? 
 who ’ s it about ? 
 who is he ? 
 who ’ s the author ? 
 what do you think about it ? 
 can I read it when you ’ re done ? 
 how many chapters does the book have ? 
 when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? 
 thanks . Charlie ! 

You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? 
 Who won ? 
 What was the score ? 

so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ? 
 what are you specializing in ? 
 that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ? 
 really ? How did you do that ? 
 that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ? 
 when did you take your exams ? 
 how do you think you did ? 
 I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ? 
 don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can ! 

What do you think of the test ? 
 It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ? 
 Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . 
 No , I wouldn't worry about you . 
 It seems to me that you always do better than you say . 
 yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for . 
 I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . 
 I need to improve my English . 
 I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . 
 I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better . 
 what's that for ? 
 do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? 
 thanks . I'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course . 
 yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University . 
 just a few years ago . What about you ? 
 are you planning on going to university ? 
 have you applied anywhere yet ? 
 congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ? 
 which one has the most interesting course ? 
 where would you like to be located ? 
 have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? 
 I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to . 
 good luck ! 
 is this line for non-residents ? 
 Ok . Here's my passport . 
 I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page . 
 I won't . 
 no , I don't have anything to declare . 
 I'll be here for about a year . 
 I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University . 
 I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus . 
 my father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts . 
 thank you very much . 
 Nothing . 
 Just get out of my face ! 
 Leave me alone ! 
 I don't want to talk about it . 
 I blew the finally exam . 
 No , I'm not . 

hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? 
 fine . How are your term papers ? 
 how could it be ? They are due two weeks later . 
 Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study 
 my advisor ? 
 Don't brother me ! 
 Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . 
 I drew a blank on ~ about the test . 
 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . 
 I'm thinking of dropping out . 
 I'm dead serious about this , Sally . 

well , I finished my last final today . 
 do you want to attend the convocation ? 
 do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? 
 no . those you have to provide for yourself . 
 well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f 
 Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . 
 it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . 
 Certainly . Ok , got you . 
 oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . 
 but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . 
 she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . 
 I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . 
 I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? 
 do you think it will work ? 
 ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . 

I'll always remember my college days . 
 It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . 
 it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . 
 I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . 
 I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 how could it be ? 
 you didn't have an offer ? 
 I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! 
 I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . 
 career path ? I'm not sure . 
 I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... 
 I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? 
 I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . 
 thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . 
 I'm going to graduate this summer . 
 I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
 well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . 
 absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . 
 that's right . Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China . 
 It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . 
 It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . 
 The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . 
 The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . 
 Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . 
 Thanks you for the encouragement . 
 Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! 
 part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? 
 sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . 
 yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . 
 of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . 
 not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . 
 sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . 
 maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . 

Can you speak French ? 
 Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? 
 About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e 
 Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . 
 Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . 
 Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . 
 Of course . 

I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . 
 I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . 
 you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . 
 yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . 
 well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . 

hello ! How are you today ? 
 it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . 
 let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! 
 oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . 
 I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . 

Do you often buy magazines ? 
 Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
 Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
 Do you have a subscription ? 
 I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . 
 Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . 
 He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 
 Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks . 
 I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 

What are you doing ? 
 There are no countries marked on the map . 
 The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . 
 Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you . 
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
 The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . 
 There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l 
 Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a 
 Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . 
 Sure . There you are . 
 There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T 
 Which tests do you mean ? 
 Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . 
 You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . 
 Yes , I do . I find it very informative.It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . 
 Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . 
 Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . 
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 

What are you reading ? 
 It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . 
 Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 

I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! 
 But it ’ s so old . 
 No , not at all . 
 I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? 
 Why does he want to do that ? 
 Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? 
 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 
 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
 It would take a lot less time .. 
 Ok . That sounds like a deal . 
 There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . 
 According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . 
 In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! 
 I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune 

Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? 
 Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this 
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . 
 It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b 
 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 
 That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any 
 Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . 
 That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o 
 I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . 
 I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 

Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? 
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 
 Have you treated any real emergencies ? 
 I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! 
 Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . 
 Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? 
 Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? 
 Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . 
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! 
 Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . 
 It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
 Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? 
 Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? 

Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 
 No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . 
 No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . 
 In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . 
 Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . 
 Well , as we say , the rest is history ... 
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! 
 What does that mean ? 
 Me ! Me ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! 
 Well , OK . But no French kissing ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! 
 I don ’ t have the slightest clue . 
 I ’ m not sure . 
 PCC is perfectly fine for me . 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . 
 You have a point . 
 I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . 
 Give it to me . 
 It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . 
 I ’ Ve been accepted ! 
 I ’ m serious . 
 NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine . 
 Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . 
 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . 
 Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . 

I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 

You got a letter in the mail . 
 What is it ? 
 What does it say ? 
 You can ’ t be serious ! 
 Are you all right ? 
 I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . 

I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . 
 Kate . She said she was too excited to go to sleep . 
 It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . 
 Yeah , how do you know about that ? 

Hey John . I have some great news . 
 I got a job offer from Dell . 
 I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now . 
 Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . 

I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations ! 
 I'm looking forward to it . 
 Let me see it . 
 It ’ s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance . 
 UCLA accepted me ! 
 I ’ m not joking . I got accepted ! 
 UCLA was my second choice , but I ’ m happy knowing I ’ Ve been accepted . 
 You have no idea how proud I am of myself . 
 That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 

This man looks very handsome.Is he married ? 
 Oh , I can't believe it.He looks very young . 
 I see . 
 That's great ! Congratulations . 
 Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position . 
 Don't mention it.You ' re always been good.What do you say we go out to celebrate ? 

He has so many friends supporting him . 
 But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . 
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . 
 It is still a mystery to me . 
 I don't know why I cannot take a step forward . 
 Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . 

I'm afraid of the darkness . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm scared of cats . 
 I feel they're dirty . 
 After all , he is a baby . 

You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 

I hear little Bob has recovered . 
 The operation was very successful . 

The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! 
 No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . 

I like the design of the coat . 
 Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . 

I prefer potatoes to eggplants . 
 But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . 

On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 

I've had enough of that ! 
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . 

I am tired of everything in my life . 
 You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . 

Has the train come yet ? 
 It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . 
 Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! 

I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . 
 Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . 
 She is a clever mother . 
 Are you sick ? 
 He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . 
 The lecturer is dull , too . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch . 
 His mother , not me , should do this . 
 He is really terrific ! 

Peter is a bag lady now . 
 He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now . 

Mark is parade his knowledge again . 
 A well-learned person never does that . 
 I was playing a joke on you . 
 Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . 
 Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? 
 But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? 

Our major is from a bigger city . 
 He brings with him some talented people from his former city . 

Mary is really a diligent girl . 
 She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months . 

What are you thinking about ? 
 Again ! 

It ’ s over . 
 Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... 
 The cause is another boy . 

I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . 
 I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . 
 Perhaps . I'm dead tired . 
 It was a real red letter day for you . 

Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag . 
 He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . 
 I'm not at all keen on this subject . 
 No foot gives out scent . 
 Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . 
 Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . 
 I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . 

Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I'm impressed . 

I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired . 
 I've tried it , but he would have none of it . 
 Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . 
 You'd better cool yourself down first . 
 Really ? How did you get the chance ? 
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
 Have a nice journey , Lily . 

Mike ! Look at the floor ! 
 What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! 
 It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . 
 What are you looking for now ? 
 Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . 

Oh ! 
 To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . 
 What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . 
 I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? 

What's up ? You look low . 
 How come ? 
 I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart . 

I am confused by what he said . 
 I don ’ t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ? 

You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 

This small town has many serious problems . 
 The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 

Joan is a thorough drag ! 
 She keeps talking when I'm reading . 

Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 

You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? 
 Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? 

Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? 
 If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money . 

Tom , is Jenny crying ? 
 I ’ m just coming for that . 
 She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 

Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . 
 What makes you think so ? 

He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . 
 When we were students , he was no good in any subject . 

Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . 
 That ’ s right . 

My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help . 
 You can say that again . 
 I'm looking for it , but you see , the market is hard up for jobs , too . 

Your ring is very beautiful . 
 Oh , it is precious . 

I have a bone to pick with you . 
 You always have a chip on your shoulder . 

What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? 
 I don't think so . He only had no common sense . 
 It's no use arguing the toss . 

It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul . 
 As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . 

Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . 
 But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 

My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . 
 A kitten being run over by a truck . 
 You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . 

That ’ s really a let-down . 
 But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . 

I am so bored all day . 
 Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . 

Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? 
 Sure thing . I have an experience like that . 
 I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . 
 How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ? 

It ’ s really terrible ! 
 Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . 

What is wrong with your face ? 
 Why ? 

He has come to life in the end . 
 Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . 
 Wish him to be healthy soon . 
 I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . 
 I never trust those stupid doctors . 
 Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . 
 Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . 
 That's quite a compliment coming from you . 
 What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ? 

Hi . 
 Yeah ? 
 Yeah ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud . 
 It's true.It was a bit loud . 
 Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . 

How do you do , Prof.Smith . 
 Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child . 
 At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country . 

What's happening in your life ? 
 That sounds great . 

You're late . 
 My phone ? 
 Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . 
 But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . 
 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 
 Do you have a cell phone ? 
 Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . 
 Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . 
 Yes , let's go . 
 No way ! 
 Oh ! What a beautiful dress ! It fits you so well.You look so charming in the dress . 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 It's so cheap . I'll buy one , too . 

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 I'm glad to hear that . 
 It's a boy . 
 You , too . 
 It's too good to be true . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . 
 I know , I'm sorry . 
 It is impossible . You cheated on me . 
 Shut up ! 
 But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . 
 Leave me ! Go away ! 
 Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . 
 Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . 
 Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . 
 Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . 
 I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it . 
 I'm sorry . I'll ask next time . 
 Thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . 
 I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . 
 I got it on sale down at the department store . 
 I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . 
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Aw , shucks , ma'am . 
 Don't worry about it . 
 I think you just need to get more sleep . 

I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . 
 Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? 
 I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! 
 No way ! Please don't follow me around . 
 Yes , I do . Leave me alone ! 
 You are pretending ! 
 It's wrong because---it isn't true . 
 Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again . 

Guess what I've brought for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 That's all right . 
 Oh , that's all right . 
 No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that . 
 Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true . 
 Oh , never mind about that . 
 No , I won't hear of it . 
 That's all right . 
 Congratulations . That's great ! 
 When do you start ? 
 You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . 
 I bet . You must be stoked . 
 Sure . It's on you right ? 
 I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 Nothing particular . But , ... 
 I , I don't know how to explain it to you . 
 Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . 
 Great ! This calls for a celebration . 
 But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . 
 I can understand that . But ... 
 You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . 
 It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . 
 Yes , they say I would get a big sum . 
 Yes , she leaves it to me . 
 I have to think about it . 
 The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . 
 Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . 
 Well , I know . So I am thinking now . 
 Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . 
 Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . 
 You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week . 
 It was me . I am so sorry . 
 I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . 
 I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . 
 I promise . 
 Wow ! She's gorgeous . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I am telling you now . 
 I didn't think you would be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 

Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . 
 Really ! Here's my trophy . 

What happened to my cup ? 
 Don't worry about it . I've got another one I can use . 
 I'm with you , Jane . 
 Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part . 

That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ? 

I'm really sorry , Bob . I accidentally damaged your bike . 
 I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . 
 Does it really look OK ? 
 And I got it on sale . 

You seemed to be fed up with Mary . 
 She is a barking dog . But she means well . 
 You are unfair to her . She is a very nice girl . 
 I am . 
 I think I'm in love . 
 Her name is Jenny . 
 We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . 
 She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . 
 Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . 
 Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ? 
 Sure . 
 I didn ’ t go anywhere . I stayed at home . 
 Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . 
 Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? 
 Thank you so much . You are so sweet . 

Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . 
 Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . 
 Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . 

What a beautiful sweater ! 
 Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants . 
 I wish I could find one just like it . 
 Do you really like it ? 
 It wasn't very expensive either . 

Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? 
 No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . 
 Well , a good teacher makes good students . 

I like your new skirt . 
 Yes . It looks terrific ! 
 You were lucky to find it . 
 Thank you . I was lucky this time . 
 I am flattered . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . 
 Sometime next month . 
 You have done excellent work . 
 Really ? How did you get the chance ? 
 My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University . 

I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud . 
 Yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time . 

I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . 
 So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . 

You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? 
 Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . 

That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ? 
 Yes . And something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . 

I've got a complaint about the noise next door . 
 Some people aren't very considerate . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ? 
 What should we do ? 
 Good idea . 
 I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? 
 I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . 
 I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . 
 That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . 
 Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . 
 I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . 
 Hey Tina . What are you doing ? 
 I just watched a movie and I'm scared . 
 I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary . 
 If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone . 
 How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense . 
 Hurry , ok . It's dark out . 
 Ok . See you soon . 
 My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ’ m very sad . Because I don ’ t want to lose this friend . 
 Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry . 

You seem really ticked off . What's up ? 
 Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? 
 Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . 
 She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . 
 I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ 

Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school . 

Jack , what's wrong ? 
 What are you talking about ? What did I do ? 
 No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . 
 I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . 
 Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . 

I'm sorry I'm late . 
 The bus I took . 
 I took the wrong bus . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here . 

I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . 
 Where is she going to college ? 
 Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! 

Here's your drink , sir . 
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away . 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . 
 Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away . 
 I'm really sorry . 
 I am not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
 But she did and it made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh , I just can't forget it . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 Thanks . Does it suit me ? 
 I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . 
 It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . 

Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? 
 Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . 

Excuse me . Have you forgotten our drinks ? 
 Why is it taking so long ? 
 There is something wrong with this dish . 
 I don't think this is fresh . 
 Would you please ask the manager to come over ? 
 Calm down . Madam . 
 I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems . 
 I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . 
 If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . 
 I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? 
 Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? 
 I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . 
 I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . 

I've come to apologize for what I said yesterday . 
 I must make an apology for losing my temper . 
 I ’ m relieved to hear that . Anyway , it ’ s my fault . 
 Give it here . 
 I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU . 
 They didn ’ t accept me . 
 It ’ s the truth . 
 I really wanted to get into NYU . 
 It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . 
 Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . 
 Are you applying to study or work abroad ? 
 What do you want to study ? 
 Have you got your visa yet ? 
 I see.Is it your first interview ? 

There ’ s a letter here for you . 
 What ’ s the letter about ? 
 Tell me what it says ! 
 You ’ re lying . 
 Are you upset ? 
 I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . 

OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? 
 That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? 
 Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? 
 Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? 
 Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . 
 Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . 
 I'm pretty tired these days . 
 I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . 
 Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? 
 If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? 
 Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . 
 Are you applying to study or work abroad ? 
 What do you want to study ? 
 Have you got your visa yet ? 
 I see . Is it your first interview ? 
 What happened ? 
 Why ? 
 I see . Well , good luck ! 
 What ? 
 Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? 
 You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? 
 When can you do that ? 
 Sure . What can you choose from ? 
 What is your major ? 
 What are the fundamental course ? 
 Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . 
 Really ? 
 why not ? 

What's this then ? 
 But this should have been handed in last Thursday . 
 Well , what's your excuse then ? 
 Oh , Yes ? 

OK . Come back into the classroom , class . 
 Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . 
 come on , baby . It ’ s time now . 
 Hurry up , little boy . 
 Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . 
 Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? 

Are you an American ? 
 Why don't you speak English ? 
 Oh , do you like Chinese ? 
 I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? 
 When will we begin ? 
 That's all right . 
 No . It's all Greek to me . 
 I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . 
 I wish you the best of luck . 
 Yeah , this is my first visit here . 
 Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . 
 On and off , for quite a few years . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I actually transferred here from another school . 
 I transferred from PCC . 
 I love it here . 
 Don ’ t get me wrong . I like it here , but PCC is better . 
 Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree . 
 As a matter of fact , I am . 
 No . I transferred here from a different school . 
 I transferred here from PCC . 
 I really like it here so far . 
 I like PCC better . 
 I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree . 
 Yes , I am . 
 No , I transferred here . 
 I transferred from PCC . 
 I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough . 
 PCC is great ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 Ready for what ? 
 Yes . I am ready . 
 Of course I ’ m nervous . 
 I won ’ t know anybody at that school . 
 Why not ? 
 That ’ s a good way to think about it . 
 Yes , I ’ m new . 
 I transferred from another school . 
 I was at PCC before . 
 I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . 
 PCC is an incredible school . 
 I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . 
 Yes , I am new . 
 I just transferred from another school . 
 I came here from PCC . 
 I am really enjoying it here so far . 
 I think PCC is a lot better than here . 
 I graduated and now want to get a BA . 
 This is my first day here . 
 I started school somewhere else . 
 I started at PCC . 
 My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . 
 I loved PCC . 
 I ’ m excited to be here . 
 I can ’ t seem to make a decision . 
 I honestly have no idea . 
 I like it here at PCC . 
 I like that idea . 
 I completely agree . 
 I ’ m staying right where I ’ m at . 
 Am I ready for what ? 
 Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . 
 I ’ m very nervous . 
 I ’ m not going to know anybody there . 
 That makes me nervous . 
 I didn ’ t think about it that way . 
 I can ’ t think of where to go . 
 I really don ’ t know . 
 I really like where I ’ m at now . 
 That may be what I ’ m going to do . 
 You ’ re absolutely right . 
 I ’ m just going to stay at PCC . 
 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 

What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
 Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . 
 Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . 
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . 

Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . 
 What happened ? 
 Who was chairing the meeting ? 
 Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . 
 What was the meeting about ? 
 It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . 
 You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . 
 You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . 

Oh , no ! 
 Look at the view from the window . 
 It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? 
 It can ’ t be helped . 
 No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? 
 She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . 

Hi , Dave . This is Zina . 
 I got your e-mail a couple of months back . 
 The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . 

I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . 
 I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... 
 I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . 

Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! 
 But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! 
 What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? 
 So he talks about you behind your back ? 
 I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . 
 My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . 
 Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . 
 They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . 
 Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! 
 Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
 Don't you see I'm trying my best ? 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 

Wedding rings ! 
 Aren't they cool ? I like the settings . 
 No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? 
 These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! 
 I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . 
 My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . 
 It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . 
 That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . 
 I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . 
 Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . 
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . 
 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 

Harry was angry last night . 
 But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . 

He got the scholarship to Harvard . 
 It's true . He is a hard worker . 

I don't like this movie . It's a bomb . 
 Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . 

My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . 
 How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! 

Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance . 
 Here's the check . I included a little extra for you . 
 I know , but you deserve it . 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . 
 Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . 
 If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . 
 I'm not sure I can't agree , dan . 
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 

I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . 
 How about the new bar across the road ? 
 I agree , I had lunch there last week . 

Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 

You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? 
 I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? 

When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . 
 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 

I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . 
 But I ruined your rug . 

You didn't tell me she was married ! 
 I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! 
 That guy was definitely a Don . 
 Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... 

Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . 
 No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? 

Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! 
 No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! 

Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? 
 The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought . 
 That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith . 
 I'm really sick ! 
 Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... 
 I'll tell you all about it another day . 
 You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... 
 Why am I always the last to know these things ? 
 No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . 
 He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! 
 And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves . 
 Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? 
 Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry . 
 Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! 
 Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ? 

I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . 
 But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . 
 This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . 

Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? 
 Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... 
 That's because it's time . 
 It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... 
 Why not ? I've got the rings ready . 
 Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... 
 Yeah . Dig my new pants ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . 

Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? 
 It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... 
 No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... 
 You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . 

Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line . 
 Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait ! 
 What does it say ? 
 That's very nice . Is it for sale ? 
 Really ? Then what do you do with it ? 
 Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! 

Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . 
 Actually , it's better ... 
 No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... 
 OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... 
 Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . 
 That takes talent ... 
 He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . 
 No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! 
 My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... 

What ? I don't get it ... 
 Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy . 
 I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... 

Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes ! 
 Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! 
 I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! 
 Yes , I did . 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . 
 What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . 

Excuse me , Supen . 
 Please forgive me , but I have to leave . I feel terrible . but ... 
 My daughter isn't feeling well . 
 I don't know . Will you forgive me ? 
 Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . 

How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 

You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 

Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? 
 I don't agree with you . It's too small to live . 
 I disagree , a big town is more lively . 
 Well , alright , I agree with you about that , but I still prefer a big town . 
 My feelings exactly . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You are absolutely right . 
 That's exactly the way I feel . 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 

You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 

David , I ’ m going to China . 
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
 I ’ m sure I will . 
 Thank you , David . 
 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
 But she did and made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . 
 Oh , thank you so much . 
 I really appreciated it . 
 It was so kind of you . 
 You ’ re a real friend in need . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 Good , happy birthday to you ! 
 Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . 

Gordon , you're ever so late . 
 But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . 
 How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
 Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? 
 Have you got it now ? 
 When ? 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . 
 Really . 
 Oh , I don ’ t care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 

How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 

We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 

You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . 
 You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? 
 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 
 Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . 

What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us . 
 That's right . 
 I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . 
 You mean I am groaned a few words ? 

It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . 
 In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . 
 And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . 
 This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . 
 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 

I have a problem . 
 My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . 
 The delivery people showed up four hours late . 
 I was late for work because of them . 
 I want my money back for the delivery . 
 It shouldn't be a problem . 

I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago . 
 I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . 
 I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . 

The mosquitos are biting me ! 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 
 Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . 
 That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! 

Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . 
 How ’ s that going ? 
 Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? 
 I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . 

Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! 
 Just get over here ! 
 So , since when is your house a bank ? 
 I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . 
 What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? 
 OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? 

Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . 
 Then what shall I do ? 

Why are you so rude to your wife ? 
 But she means to help you , not to trouble you . 

Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? 
 Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . 
 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 
 No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! 
 I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 

Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . 
 It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 

When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
 I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
 Why not ? 
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . 
 I'll beat him . 

My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
 John is a peacemaker . He simply doesn ’ t bother . He says he should give him a free hand . 
 What are you talking about ? 
 You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children . 
 About my boyfriend . 
 You are really a wet blanket . 
 Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . 
 Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 
 So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 

John's father got married again . 
 If I tell you . , you must be completely taken aback . 
 He married a girl who is only eighteen ! 

I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . 
 I hope so . 
 Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . 
 No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . 
 Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match . 
 I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her . 
 Yeah . 
 Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . 
 Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . 
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 
 How about tomorrow night ? 

Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college . 
 But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning . 
 I feel confused about the grammars . 
 And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated . 
 I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad . 
 Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . 
 Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . 
 Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? 

I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . 
 If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . 

What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? 
 I think they will . 
 I like them very much . They are delicious . 
 Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? 
 Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! 
 Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . 
 Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . 

I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . 
 I hope so . But I'm always caught short . 

Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! 
 Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? 
 But my father did not . He didn't have much time . 
 Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? 
 It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? 
 Can I see the rainbow ? 

What courses are you taking ? 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 
 That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? 
 What is he like ? 
 Are you able to follow him ? 
 Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher . 

John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? 

Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 

Who did the stupid thing ? 
 I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that . 

How did Jim get the money ? 
 He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . 

Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . 
 I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . 
 You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? 
 Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . 
 I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . 
 That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . 
 A training course ? That must be costly . 
 OK , let's have a try . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 
 Yes . That would be good . 
 What's the matter ? 
 You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ? 
 You ought to complain . These machine are always out of order . 
 I didn't really like it . 
 I found it very disappointing . 
 I wasn't happy with it . 

How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets ? 
 I'm glad you're so happy . 

Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 

Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 

I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 

I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . 
 I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! 
 Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . 
 You can always take it again . 
 Elvin Dixon . Who are you ? 
 Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual . 
 You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet . 

Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? 
 Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? 
 That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . 

You're being childish . Your nose will heal . And so will your pride , if you let it . 
 Don't know what ? 
 Is that right ? Like what kind of changes ? 
 Come on , grow up . Have you seen Vince around ? 
 Right . You're right . But she's just evil . Someone should drive a stake through her heart . 
 I'm OK . I'll be fine . I'v cool . I'm cold . I'm like ice . She won't know what hit her . 

How are Zina's new programmers working out ? 
 So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? 
 Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . 

Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? 
 Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . 
 Did you hear the names he was calling me ? 

There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . 
 She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . 
 Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . 

What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 I think you'd better apologize . 
 Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . 
 Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . 
 Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . 

Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
 Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . 

what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 

My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race . 
 A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games 
 You have to . It's sure . 

You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 

Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . 
 I did . But they said they won ’ t change them . 

I really need a new pair of trousers . 
 Yes , I do . This one is very old now . 
 They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible . 

What happen , John ? 
 Why do you look unhappy ? 
 Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . 
 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
 But she did and made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . 
 What did he say ? 
 Why ? 
 It is stupid to say so . 
 Sorry . You know the rules . 
 That ’ s out of the question . 
 Not a chance . 
 Sorry , it ’ s impossible . 
 I am worried . 
 My exam . 
 I feel very nervous about it . 

Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? 
 Shall I make more sandwiches ? 

Good morning , Loans . 
 I would like to compliment you on your diligence . 
 Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . 

Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 

My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! 
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? 
 Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! 
 Well . How do you know ? 
 What a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 It's still early . 
 Since we're late , let's go to see a film . 

What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . 
 No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? 
 Is it a two-pin socket ? 
 Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 

My friend Jane is very beautiful . 
 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . 
 Dark blue . 
 Twenty . 
 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . 

Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . 
 But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 

Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . 
 It ’ s all right . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 
 I totally understand . 
 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 

Hi , Becky , what's up ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 For example ? 
 No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . 
 My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . 
 We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . 

Come in , come in ! 
 I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . 
 I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . 
 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . 

Do you have to leave soon ? 
 Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . 
 What ? 
 He knows you very well . 
 I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . 

Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . 
 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
 It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . 

I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . 
 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 

How beautiful the flower is ! 
 You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . 
 Where it is ? 

They promised us a sea view . 
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 

So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good . 
 He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too . 
 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
 That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 
 I don ’ t want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
 Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 Does the class start again , Mam ? 
 Oh , breaktime flies . 
 Mam , another minute , could I ? 

Er ... Alison ? 
 I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . 
 It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! 

It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
 No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . 
 Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . 
 Yes.That would be good . 
 What's the matter ? 
 You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? 
 You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . 
 Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . 
 Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? 

Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ? 
 I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid . 
 Don't worry . I won't . 
 Have fun getting ripped off ! 
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 
 It's my dream . 
 It must be Kate . 

You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
 They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .

just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . 
 This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . 
 We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! 
 I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . 
 You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere . 
 I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? 
 Just throw them away ! 
 The lecturer is dull , too . 
 I feel the same way . 
 I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! 
 Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? 
 His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . 
 Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . 
 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . 
 Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 Oh , do you really think so ? 
 But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . 
 I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it . 
 I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know . 
 So glad that you think so ! 
 Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . 
 Yeah , I'm afraid so . 
 Yes , it is annoying . 
 I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . 
 One of my neighbors has a dog . 
 It barks all night long . 
 I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do . 
 You only need to tell me that once . 
 I agree with you , but that's easier said than done . 
 Well , I must apologize , madam . We have new computers here , you know . 
 I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , that ’ s very sad . 
 What did you do ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 
 Yeah , me too . 
 Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . 
 Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . 
 Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? 
 Of course . 
 Yeah , Got a Coke ? 
 Hurry , the movie is coming back on . 
 I heard it . 
 Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . 
 I want it short . 
 It will do . 
 Are they coming to Chicago again ? 
 Oh , good ! We can all get together again . 
 And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park . 
 Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . 

Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ’ s very worried . 
 I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose . 
 But my Rose is great . 
 Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . 

Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? 
 Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? 
 And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? 
 What ’ s happening ? 
 What ’ s Mr . King doing ? 
 And is she helping him ? 
 Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . 
 You don ’ t love me , Roy . 
 No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . 
 I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . 
 Oh , shut up , Roy . 
 Oh , SHUT UP ! 
 What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 
 Then when did you go to sleep ? 
 When ? 
 Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? 
 This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? 
 So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up . 

Could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you possibly give me a lift home ? 
 Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much . 
 Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University . 
 Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ? 
 No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector . 
 Have a wallet size print made for me , too . 

She is so stupid . 
 So what ? 

Did you see that ? 
 How could you miss that ? 

Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! 
 She broke up with her boyfriend . 
 She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... 
 He sometimes really drives me crazy . 
 I know only too well what that's like . 
 I was very sad when I was laid off last year . 
 The last straw , huh ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 There's no need to apologize . 
 Forget it . It was an accident . 
 But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
 I don't care . 
 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . 
 Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . 
 I am wiped out . Thank you . 
 Never ! But thank you for inviting me . 

Are things still going badly with your house guest ? 
 leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . 

Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . 
 Thank you SO much . 
 What ? 
 I ’ m sorry ? ! 
 I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . 
 Get in . 
 You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . 

Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? 
 How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? 
 Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . 
 Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! 

So , what happened ? 
 He stood you up . 
 Not possible . 
 Absolutely . 
 And no phone . 

If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up . 
 No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . 

How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? 

I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble . 

I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . 
 I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . 

I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . 
 Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . 
 You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? 
 I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem . 
 You bet ! 
 Never mind about that . 
 No , I won ’ t hear of it . 
 I would if I could . 
 Yes , With pleasure . 
 It really depends on when and how long 

OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building . 
 Would you like to go to the top ? 
 The view is breath-taking . 
 Until when ? 
 No problem . 
 Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . 
 why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? 
 Well . You ’ re here . 
 A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . 
 Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . 
 Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . 
 Cut out , would you ? 
 No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . 
 No , thanks . I am okay . 
 Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . 
 I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . 
 I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . 

So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . 
 I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on . 

God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... 
 Excuse me ? 
 You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . 
 Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . 
 What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? 

You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? 
 It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... 

I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . 
 But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . 

Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! 
 You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good ! 
 He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are . 
 I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? 
 Oh , you poor thing ! 
 We still have to do about ten more . 
 I know . Maybe we can finish it tomorrow . 
 All right . Let's call it quits and go home . 

Many congratulations on your winning the game . 
 You were doing great out there ! 

How's your new work , Carl ? 
 Good for you . 
 Well , you have to take the bad with the good . 

Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning . 
 That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . 
 Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . 
 What do you mean too late ? 

Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 Well , they are very nice you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry I couldn't help you . 
 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . 
 Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . 

You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . 
 What's your method of learning ? 
 What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? 
 That's a good idea . You are really creative . 
 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 First , I worked as a servant . 
 I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . 
 Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 
 It's just what I want . 
 I am really pleased with it . 
 It's super . 
 It was me . I am so sorry . 
 I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . 
 I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . 
 I promise . 
 I don't want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the TV for what ? 
 Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . 
 Oh , How annoying ! 
 It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . 
 What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . 
 I ’ m so sorry to hear that . 
 Of course , what can I do for you ? 
 Oh , what exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry , Sir . I'll see what I can do about that . 
 Yes , it's my steak . 
 It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . 
 Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . 
 Yes , please give me another Calsberg . 
 No , thank you . I've had enough . 
 Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . 
 Do you have the receipt with you ? 
 Thank you . Do you want your money back ? 
 I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . 
 Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger . 
 Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , dear ! I'll do well I can . 
 No , that ’ s not all your fault . 
 There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it . 
 Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . 
 I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . 
 Yeah , and the prices there are very high . 

We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . 

Can I help you ? 
 May I know the reason , madam ? 
 When did you buy it ? 
 Can I see the receipt ? 
 Well , if there is no damage , you can return it . 
 It makes me sick . 
 That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 Sure , I'd love to . 
 Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally . 
 Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please ! 
 Alright . What is that you want to tell me ? 
 What ? Are you serious ? Oh , my gosh ! There will be guys everywhere . 
 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 You hit the nail right on the head . 
 What is it ? 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 
 Ok , cool . 
 No problem . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should tell me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You are all the same . 
 I am not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
 But she did and it made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh , I just can't forget it . 
 I agree . 
 I can't believe they would play so good . 
 It's OK . 
 Don't be silly . 
 All right . Next time you will treat . 

Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . 

Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ? 
 I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ? 
 You are welcome . 
 You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . 

Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! 
 Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 

Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? 
 It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . 
 What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . 
 Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! 
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
 To encourage the staff increases . 
 What about the afternoon ? 

Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 
 Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . 
 True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 

Do you have s second ? 
 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair . 
 That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . 
 It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 You're dancing so well . 
 When did you learn to dance ? 
 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 Is that right ? I didn't know it . 
 Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ? 
 Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? 

I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . 
 Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? 
 You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . 
 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . 

Hello , is this the ABC company ? 
 We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it . 
 Our reservation number is J - 221 . 
 You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ? 
 Here I ’ ll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ? 
 I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . 
 No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . 
 They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . 
 I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . 

Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! 
 Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! 
 Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! 
 Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? 
 What ! 
 Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park . 
 South Park is a popular cartoon . You're so out of it , Jen 

What's that ? 
 For me ? 
 Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? 
 What does that mean , not big but fat ? You didn't buy ... 
 Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! 
 You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . 
 You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! 
 Yes . What do you want ? 
 What do you care , dork ? 
 You mean fat boy ? 

Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue . 
 And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! 
 It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . 
 Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . 
 I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . 
 It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts . 
 I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . 

I always think everybody looks down on me 
 How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . 
 Don't be that negative . 

I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . 
 But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . 
 That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? 
 I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . 

Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? 
 So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? 
 Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . 
 You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . 
 Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 
 It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . 
 Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . 
 Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian . 
 Yes . I can lend you some . 

I prefer potatoes to eggplants . 
 But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . 

Hi , Becky , what's up ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 For example ? 
 No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . 
 My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . 
 Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . 
 I guess I never thought of that before . 
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . 
 Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . 
 Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . 
 She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? 
 They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? 
 That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? 
 What do you mean ? 

Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . 
 Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . 

You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . 
 I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . 
 Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . 

Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? 
 That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . 

You look really wiped out ? 
 Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . 

Did you punch in ? 
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 
 Sure , when those never ending meetings . 
 Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation . 

Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 
 we've spent $ 1,000 . 

How delicious ! Tender and crisp ! 
 Yes , it's really savory . 

This is the best dinner I've ever had . 
 I've never tasted anything better . 

What a pin-up she is ! 
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 

What upsets you ? 
 It is not your mother finding one for you ? 
 Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . 
 No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . 
 I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . 
 Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . 

Let me clear away the broken glass . 
 It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . 

She's pretty and meek . 
 What makes you think so ? 

Look out ! 
 You must have rolled over something just now . 

What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! 

Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! 
 I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . 

I'm scared that she might not come back . 
 But she took her luggage away with her . 

I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . 
 Tell me , please . 

I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money . 
 It's a large sum of money . I can't afford to lose it . 
 The beauty under the tree ? 
 She is a young man ! 
 That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
 His parents must feel very happy . 
 I feel the same way . 
 It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . 
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . 
 It is still a mystery to me . 
 Were you ? your performance was excellent . 

Crazy ! He locked himself in the room . 
 But you can see the key in his hand through the window ! 

Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? 
 Oh , but why ? 

How do you feel about the TV series ? 
 Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . 

Every teacher likes him . 
 How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . 

Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe . 
 All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy ! 
 Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . 
 Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! 
 But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . 
 You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . 
 I felt as if I had been in a different world . 

I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help ! 
 Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight ! 
 It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now . 
 I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind . I'm not buying anything ! 
 The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ? 

The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . 
 Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . 

I'm so glad I bought this watch ! 
 I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . 
 Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . 
 Well , surfing , scuba diving ... 
 It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? 
 Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! 
 Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow . 
 Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! 
 Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... 
 Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? 
 Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . 

This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . 

Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ? 
 That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some . 

I'll never ever work together with him ! 
 Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! 

Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . 

your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta 
 this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . 
 ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 
 that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 
 fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . 
 I don't think it's broken . 
 fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . 
 what do you mean ? 
 yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . 
 you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . 
 quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark 
 well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . 
 most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . 
 I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . 
 really ? I thought you hated shopping ? 
 sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on . 
 that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? 
 I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? 
 this is perfect ! What do you think ? 
 I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! 
 Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . 
 I can tell you worked hard on it . 
 Well , it was definitely worth all the time . 

Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 
 Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . 
 Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . 
 I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . 

Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? 

You are late . What ’ s the deal ? 

Oh , no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project . 

You have your ducks in a row . 

You are an eager beaver . 

Mom . My legs are killing me . 

Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! 
 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
 Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . 
 You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light . 
 If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters ! 
 Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful . 
 You must be joking ! 
 Do you have to remember every text ? 

What's all this noise about ? 
 Why ? 

Do you like playing tennis ? 
 Maybe you haven't found the magic . 

I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . 
 But a taxi costs too much . 

I'm tired of dancing . 
 Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners . 

I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . 
 It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . 

What a boring film ! 
 And the plot is so simple . 
 But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . 
 You're complaining again . 
 I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it.It ' s such an interesting subject . 

Is there anything wrong with your food this evening , Miss ? 
 Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ? 
 I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty . 
 Ok , Miss . I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner . 
 Where do they come from ? 
 I can't see it . 
 So what are you trying to say to me ? 
 How should I say it ? 
 It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . 
 Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . 
 That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . 
 So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? 
 You see , we still have hurdle . 
 I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . 
 You have to type all day . 
 Yeah.He never stops asking questions . 

All the routine work really browns me off . 
 I wish I hadn't chosen this job . 
 What is it ? 
 Maybe there's something wrong with her . 
 what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? 
 well , there is a play on campus this weekend . 
 what's the matter with these ideas ? 
 what about going on a picnic ? 
 you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? 

Do you like our new history teacher ? 
 You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . 

My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! 

I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . 

I am really impressed with your presentation skills . 
 Well , your time has been well spent ! 
 Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! 
 I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . 
 It can't be expressed by words . 
 Yeah , I think it will be wonderful . 
 Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do 
 But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . 
 When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . 
 Yes . Have a look . 
 Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team . 
 Well , I hope the client feels the same way ! 

We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? 

You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut . 

Could you do me a favour ? I don ’ t understand this French document . 

I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out . 

So , Emily , how was your day ? 
 It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 That's not very fair . What did you do ? 
 Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? 
 Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? 
 Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? 
 That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . 
 That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . 
 Why ? What are they like ? 
 Have you ever talked to them about it ? 
 What did they say ? 
 They soud like the neighbours from hell ! 
 I thought you didn't talk to them much . 
 What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? 
 Maybe you should think about moving . 
 Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . 
 Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? 
 Let ’ s go for a joy ride . 
 To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . 
 First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . 
 He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! 
 That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . 
 No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . 
 I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . 
 That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . 

Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! 

I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . 

This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up . 

I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ? 

Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious . 

I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad . 

I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . 

Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . 

Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? 
 How come ? 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 

Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome . 
 Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . 
 Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . 
 Perfect . It really hits the spot . 
 I see . I have run as fast as I can . 
 Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . 
 OK , boy . I will buy it for you . 
 What a bone head ! Be careful next time . 
 Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . 
 thanks ; do you like it ? 
 yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . 
 I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . 
 it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . 
 I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . 
 yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! 
 how do you know her ? 
 why didn't you tell me about that before ? 
 well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . 

Wow ! It ’ s packed . 

Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . 
 I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it . 
 Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . 
 nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees . 
 it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? 
 why is that ? 
 your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? 
 that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . 
 maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! 
 try not to let it bother you too much . 
 ok , I'll see you in a bit . 

is everything alright ? 
 what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! 
 I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 
 then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! 
 turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? 
 so where did you land ? 
 that sounds like a nightmare ! 
 have you had anything to eat ? 
 I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 
 yes , do you like it ? 
 it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 it must have been a few years ago now . 
 they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! 
 the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 

so , how should we go to the theatre ? 
 I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . 
 it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . 
 train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . 
 we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . 
 fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
 don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
 see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 
 I am just casting pearls before swine . 
 I was not born yesterday . 
 I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? 
 how did the business trip go ? 
 I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! 
 our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . 
 I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . 
 no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? 

are you ready to go the concert ? 
 actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . 
 is your helmet comfortable ? 
 maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . 
 is that your new bicycle ? 
 it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! 
 I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . 
 it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . 
 I always meet people like him . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . 
 I got the short end of the stick . 
 She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp ! 
 You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! 
 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 
 No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! 
 I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 

Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth ! 

Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye 
 I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . 
 Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . 
 I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... 
 You are something else you know that ? 
 I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . 
 Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . 
 I know why we have reservations . 
 But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . 
 Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? 

Look at what you have done . All thumbs . 

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? 
 Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . 
 Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . 
 Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . 
 We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . 
 There is some really good news though ! 
 I got offered a new job ! 
 Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! 
 Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! 
 He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
 Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
 But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . 
 That would be great ! Give me a call ! 

hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? 
 what ' the matter ? 
 I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . 
 that's true . 
 it was good . I brough lunch from home today . 
 well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy . 
 yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? 
 well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . 
 yeah , it's hard to believe but true . 
 Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! 
 Beth , what date is today ? 
 What is the date today ? 
 Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . 
 Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? 
 Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . 
 April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! 
 Thanks . 
 I guess so . 
 That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . 

it's getting cold . 
 Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern . 
 it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . 
 that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? 
 that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . 
 perfect ! 
 thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . 

hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 
 same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . 
 true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 
 the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . 
 inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . 
 yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . 
 you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . 
 for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . 

Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 
 When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . 
 Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 
 Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! 
 Steven , I ... 
 What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? 
 What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! 
 I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! 

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long 
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 

I'm not satisfied with it . 
 Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . 
 No . Can I have my money back ? 
 A receipt ? 
 Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 I shall . I wasn't as careless as John Sampson . He walked across that wet cement over there . 
 The headmaster asked them not to do so . 
 They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now ! 

Mom , why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks . 
 But i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl . 
 But i do not like anyone touch my head . 
 What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ? 
 Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ? 
 That is my work , i will try it . 
 Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . 
 I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . 
 Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . 

Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? 
 Will you be checking any bags today . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . 
 I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . 
 Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . 

Car trouble center . How may I help you ? 
 Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . 
 OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? 
 Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? 
 No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . 
 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 

Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? 
 Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
 What ! I resent that ! 

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 

I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 
 Well , that seems easy enough . 
 Geez . Is that all ? 
 Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! 
 Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . 
 Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . 
 Um ... no . 

What do you think of this one ? 
 And this one ? Too flashy ? 
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 
 Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . 
 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
 Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! 
 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 

The mosquitos are biting me ! 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 
 Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . 
 That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! 

What are you doing ? 
 Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! 
 I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . 
 I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing . 
 You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! 
 Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 
 I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . 
 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 
 Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 
 Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . 
 I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . 
 You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore 
 Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . 
 Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . 
 You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
 Where are you going ? 
 Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? 
 Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
 Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . 
 haven't been sleeping well recently . 
 every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . 
 yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . 
 yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . 
 I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . 
 thanks for understanding . 
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 
 I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . 

Hi Mary , how's it going ? 
 terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . 
 really ? What happened ? 
 that's pretty harsh . 
 you know she probably feels just as bad . 
 well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . 

the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 
 great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
 port , please . 
 the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 
 next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . 
 it's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
 oh , here's to your health . 
 cheers . 
 I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? 
 Jack ? 
 I will never go out with him anymore . 
 last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! 
 he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . 
 it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . 
 I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . 
 oh , he really should . 
 What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . 
 Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . 
 What were the odds ? 
 Too bad . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 

Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 
 oh ? What's that ? 
 what gift ? 
 you refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
 perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 

Are you cold ? 
 I wonder if we can change the temperature . 
 There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? 
 Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep . 
 What did they say about the air conditioning ? 
 That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? 

I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . 
 It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . 
 I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . 
 Yes , it's an amazing drop . 
 Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? 
 What ? 
 Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . 
 Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! 

What's wrong with him ? 

My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . 

I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . 

I'm so busy . I don't know how will get this done . 

This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? 

Wow . Look how polite your son has become . 

She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . 

So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ? 
 And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ? 
 And , who is sponsoring your trip ? 
 Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . 
 And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? 
 I ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations ! 
 That's because you cheated . 
 Yes , you do . 
 That was the straw that broke the camel's back . 
 I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! 
 Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? 
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! 
 What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
 I ’ m going as fast as I can ! 
 You ’ re such a geek ! 
 Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? 
 It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed ! 
 Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street . 
 Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute ! 
 Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful ! 
 Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th ! 

This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! 
 Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! 
 Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far ! 
 Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark ! 
 It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! ! 
 License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? 
 Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ? 
 Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ? 
 You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney . if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you.do you understand the arrest to you ? 

I wish I could unsay the sharp words to him . He must hate me very much . 
 Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! 
 Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . 
 Thank you . 
 I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . 
 Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . 
 Self-service ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . 
 Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . 
 What sign ? 
 I see . 
 I am hurrying . 
 I can't figure out which dress to wear . 
 Can I give you a hand ? 
 Sure thing . I've got time . 
 Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . 
 I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money . 
 Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on ! 
 Thank you . You save me . 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . 
 I'm just in the mood to act goofy . 
 I guess I'm glad exams are over . 
 Yes . I love it , too . 
 I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . 
 What's wrong ? 
 Then just keep your chin up . 
 I'm looking forward to going to America . 
 Next week . 
 Give me a minute . 
 There you go . 
 What's wrong ? 
 What's so bad about it ? 
 Sorry about that . 
 Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? 
 If you would like me to , I could help you with that . 
 I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . 
 If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . 
 That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . 
 Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! 
 Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . 
 No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . 
 Why not now ? I'm hungry . 
 I enjoyed myself , too . 
 Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . 
 That's great . Let's go ! 
 It was a kind of sixth sense . 
 No . 
 Why are you considering trying for it ? 
 What is it about this job that appeals to you ? 
 Yes , you could be right . There is a lot to consider . 
 Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ? 
 I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind . 
 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . 
 It's instructive and inspiring . 
 No , it's a semimonthly . 
 Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . 

What's the weather forecast for today ? 
 Any rain ? 
 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
 Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . 
 You mean 30 push-ups ? 
 It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . 
 Not bad at all . 
 Yes , of course . This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , I ’ d love another glass . You ’ re a wonderful host . Thank you for everything . 

Say , what's your favorite sport ? 
 Do you play much tennis ? 
 Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all . 
 0kay . Dinner's on me . 
 Easy come , easy go . 
 I would if I were you . 
 No comment . 
 I can't come until next week . 
 Thanks , I'll see you around Wednesday then . 
 I Couldn't care less . 
 I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 I'd like to . 
 OK , will do ! 
 Fine , thanks . How about you ? 
 So ? 
 Hello , Jack . It's Mary . What are you doing in your office ? 
 Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? 
 What about Saturday ? 
 Will you come round next Tuesday ? 
 What do you say to next Wednesday then ? 
 Ok . Bye . 

Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . 
 I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . 
 You ’ re the best ! 
 Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you . 
 Come over and visit when you have time . 

Jim , I heard you ’ Ve bought a new computer . 
 Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ? 
 A piece of cake ? 

Happy birthday , Aims ! 
 Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . 
 I'm very glad to hear that . 

I had an accident . 

I went bungee jumping yesterday . 

Hi , Mary , long time no see . 
 Yes , next March . 

Have you eaten ? 

Well , it was nice meeting you . 
 Sure , I'll give you a call . 

What are you going to do next year ? 
 Do you have any where in mind ? 

Give me a call tomorrow . 

I'm terribly nervous . 

I'm tired of this job . 

Have you ever seen coco ? 
 I'm so familiar with her songs , but I don't know what kind of person she is in real life . 
 Wow ! I'm so happy for you . 
 My condolences . 
 Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . 
 Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . 
 It's fun . 
 You bet ! 
 It was exciting ! 
 Well , that's life . 
 Me too . 
 My condolences . 
 We broke up . 
 I told you so . 
 Mind your own business . 
 Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips . 
 Do you have any ketchup ? 

Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ? 
 No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . 

Jim , how was your weekend ? 
 That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . 
 I can ’ t wait to go there myself . 
 What is it ? 
 Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! 
 Thanks for the compliment . 

Let's go in . 

Thanks for your hospitality . 

I've come to say goodbye . 
 I'm catching the 11:00 train . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . 
 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 
 Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
 Okay . Check you later . 
 It was just a misunderstanding . 
 What ? 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Really ? Good luck for them . 
 They're both very well , thanks . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . Why don't you come with me ? 
 It's been nice talking to you . 

Why are you all dressed up ? 

Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . 
 You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! 
 It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . 

Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? 
 Tell me about it , will you ? 
 Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? 
 You were lucky then . 
 What did you do after that ? 
 So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 

Are you ready ? 

You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? 
 Like what ? 
 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 
 I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . 
 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . 
 Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . 

Hello , Bob , this is Frank . 
 I didn't know you knew Frank . 

I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . 
 Really ? 

Get changed ! 

Ben , what are you doing ? 
 Why ? 
 Have you thought about graduate school ? 
 Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ? 
 Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . 
 I'm sorry . 
 I feel like something good to eat . 
 Hey , that sounds a good idea . 
 Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . 
 Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . 
 I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . 
 Yes and I've written him a letter . 
 Hello , Mary , where do you work ? 
 Is the pay good ? 
 I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ? 
 That's great . I'll pick you up at eight . 
 Goodbye . 
 Sounds good . 
 I thought you had forgotten . 
 Thank you honey , it means a lot to me . 
 I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! A little labor , much health . 
 Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . 
 I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . 
 Okay . 
 I trust you ’ re keeping well ? 
 So we can get down to business . 
 I wonder Why . 
 Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . 
 Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . 
 Me too . 
 Of course , but I'll have to go now . 
 But , Bob , we were so good together . 
 I don't understand . We were getting along so well . 
 You're telling me . 
 Sure , I'm looking forward to it . 
 I'll get used to not seeing my parents . 
 Okay . Keep in touch . 
 That's great . What's on tonight ? 
 Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . 
 On the contrary , very exciting . 
 Yes , beautiful weather we're having . 
 Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . 
 I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
 Couldn't be better . 
 Have you ever been to America ? 
 You'd like it . 
 Where to ? 
 Hello , Brian . 
 Hello , Bob . 
 No . What happened ? 
 I am very pleased to meet you . 
 That sounds an interesting job , Bob . 
 You asked for it . 
 Nothing ' doing . 
 Me too . 
 Okay , I'll give you a ring next week . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I'm used to being on my own . 
 Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . 
 I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? 
 I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . 
 Yeah , it sure would . 
 Bob and Mary are back together . 
 Me too , they're such a nice couple . 
 Who cares ? 
 We may go abroad , my wife wants to go to Egypt , and I'd like to go there too . We haven't made up our mind yet . 
 We may travel by sea . It's cheaper . 

How do you like your work ? 
 What do you do ? 
 Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . 
 I'm a clerk in a shop . 
 Good morning . 
 Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual . 
 Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . 
 Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all . 
 Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself . 
 For example ? 
 Okay . 
 He makes me sick . 
 You're too humble . 
 How nice of him ! 
 No problem , anytime . 
 Okay , thank you . 
 I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! 
 That might be a little too cold for some people . 
 What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . 
 You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . 
 Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! 
 That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? 
 Do you need it for the whole weekend ? 
 We will need to know who will be driving the van . 
 It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? 
 Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . 
 Are you serious ? 
 That's a wonderful choice . 
 January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . 
 I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . 
 Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . 
 I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers . 
 Are you certain that that is what you want to do ? 
 Why do you think that this would be a good move ? 
 Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . 
 I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better . 
 I think you should definitely apply for the position . 
 Don't worry . Everything will be fine . 
 What a great idea ! 
 I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . 
 April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . 
 We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . 
 I'll put the survey online this afternoon . 
 Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ? 
 Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday ? 
 I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ? 
 Could you drop it off on Sunday night ? 
 Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night . 
 I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? 
 What day will you need it for ? 
 Maybe that could work . I need to know who will be driving it . 
 If I give you the keys to the garage , could you bring it back on Sunday evening ? 
 OK , but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest . 
 I'm almost done . 
 I'm all done now . 
 I don't understand . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 I apologize . 
 Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ? 
 Nothing much . 
 Don't worry . I'm almost finished . 
 All right . I'm finished . 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 What don't you like about it ? 
 I'm sorry that you don't like it . 
 I'm sure we can work something out . 
 Have you thought about the cost ? 
 I believe it'll be very expensive . 
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
 Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . 

This is great , isn't it ? 
 We should do this more often . 

Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? 
 Great . What do you think of it ? 
 Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? 
 It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? 
 What is the special local product ? 
 I hope to go there someday . 
 We had a difference of opinion . 
 She'll be fine . 
 It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? 
 Isn't it a Sunday ? 
 So you are leaving two weeks from now ? 

What do you think of when you're praying ? 
 Does that help you faith ? 

Excuse me . Do you have the time ? 
 Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? 

I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . 
 Are you sure you have the time ? 
 What would be the best time for you to help me ? 
 Should we just meet here ? 
 I'll see you then . 

Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! 
 I love anything with chocolate the best . 
 Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? 
 I haven't ever cared for that myself . 
 That sounds absolutely disgusting ! 

Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? 
 How come ? 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 

Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? 
 I hate to ask you to do something like that . 
 When could we get together ? 
 Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? 
 I'll come prepared . 

There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! 
 I love fruit flavored ices the best . 
 What is your least favorite ice cream ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . 
 That could be interesting . 

I was thinking about applying for the new position . 
 It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . 
 Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . 
 I am also thinking about the pay . 
 Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . 

Is my hair done yet ? 
 How long until you're finished ? 
 I like my hair so much . 
 It's beautiful . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 
 Thanks for everything . 

I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! 
 Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . 
 No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? 
 I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . 
 I think that would be horrible ! 

I want to try something different today . 
 I want a different hair style . 
 Can you make my hair short ? 
 Make it a few inches long . 
 I've been thinking about this for a while now . 
 I honestly want my hair that short . 

Are you almost finished with my hair ? 
 How much longer is it going to be ? 
 I absolutely love it . 
 Yes , I truly do . 
 How much do I owe you ? 
 Here you go , thanks for everything . 

Let's do something different today . 
 I would like you to give me a different hair style . 
 Give me a short haircut . 
 I want you to cut it to a few inches long . 
 I've had this idea for some time now . 
 This is what I want . 

Will you be done doing my hair soon ? 
 How much time do you need ? 
 I think it looks gorgeous . 
 I honestly think it looks great . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 
 Thanks for doing such a good job . 

I really want to switch things up . 
 I think I want to try a new style . 
 I want you to cut my hair shorter . 
 I want my hair to be only a few inches long . 
 Yes , I've been wanting it short for a while now . 
 I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want . 

Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy . 
 This dish taste terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good . 
 Would you like another beer ? 
 Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers ! 

Excuse me . 
 I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet . 
 Thank you . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . 
 Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 
 Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . 
 Well , let's finish this great dinner first . 

Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . 
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? 
 So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . 
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? 
 It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . 

What ? 
 nothing . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I don ’ t actually know him . 
 I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . 
 Yes . 

Do bullfights interest you much ? 
 So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 

You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . 
 And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . 
 Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . 
 You don ’ t love me ? 
 But we ’ re so right for each other . 

Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? 
 So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . 
 You do ? 
 But I find Japanese ones better . 
 Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . 
 Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . 
 I'm nervous as can be . 
 Thanks . 
 Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? 
 Just as usual , you know . 
 Isn't it time for dinner ? 
 How about Mac Donald's ? 
 That's disgusting . 
 It feels like there's going to be rain later . 
 We'll go tomorrow . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . 
 Not too good yet . Better than I was though . 
 Come on . Cheer up ! 
 It seems like he's not coming . 
 Sure . 
 What's the big deal ? 
 It's Friday . 
 Really , who started the argument ? 
 Did you know it takes two to tango ? 
 I don't have any plans . 
 There are three of them , the Three Tenors . 
 Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . 
 Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . 
 Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
 Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 
 Who was the conductor at that event ? 
 So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . 
 I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . 
 I think so . 
 No , what happened ? 
 Really , what's going to happen now ? 
 Yeah , I'd better head for home . 
 Of course , I like flowers . 
 I like peach blossom , because I like spring . 
 Yes . How about you ? 
 You have a perfect taste ! 
 Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . 

Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? 
 I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . 
 They are especially harmful to teenagers . 

Dad , what's the date ? 
 In seven days it will be Christmas Day . 
 So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? 

You've met her before , haven't you ? 

He's too young for the job . 

Why do you like this computer ? 

Do you have spare time tonight ? 
 There will be a live show of football tonight . 
 AC Milan versus Real Madrid . 
 Absolutely . 
 Great idea ! Here we go ! 
 It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . 
 Which side are you on ? 
 Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . 
 What a good goal ! 
 He quit 
 That's a secret . 
 You've got no guts ! 
 I called in sick . 
 Count me out . 
 That's too bad . 
 Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you . 
 I'm from New Orleans . What about you ? 
 Really ? This is a beautiful town . 
 OK . Can I have your phone number ? 
 I will . Bye . 
 Hi , Ross . Glad to see you , too . 
 A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ? 
 That's great ! What time will it start at ? 
 OK . I'll come . See you then . 

Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . 
 Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . 
 Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . 
 About 4 . 
 No , just come here . 
 Bye . 
 Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . 
 Light music and classic music . 
 But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . 
 Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . 
 What ? 
 Jay Chou's title song in his new album . 
 Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . 
 I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart . 

It's raining . 

I dare you to talk to that girl . 

Dad , why are you taping the windows ? 
 Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow . 
 OK . Dad ! I'm coming . 
 I love to dance the fast music . 
 Yes , it's my favorite . 
 You're a good dancer . 
 Sorry . I feel like sitting out the next dance . 
 Good idea . 
 How do you like this waltz ? 
 May I ask you for a dance ? 
 You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . 

Dad , I'm scared . 
 But , dad , it's stormy outside . 
 Ar ! Dad , the power went out . 
 Oh , that scared me . 
 Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! 
 Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . 
 She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . 
 But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . 
 Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? 

How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ? 
 Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . 
 Stop acting like this . Say away ! 
 What did she say ? 
 Give her up . 
 So so . 
 Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? 
 ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy . 
 I like the slow dance . I am good at rumba and waltz . 
 Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage . 
 Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles . 
 Sure . 

Are you free tonight ? 

What's your favourite steps ? 
 How about rumba ? 
 Really ? You must like tango , right ? 
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . 
 Oh , you dance it so well . 
 I think I'm your lucky fellow . 
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? 
 Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 

Excuse me , miss . I'm Bob . 
 I'm very glad to meet you . May I have this dance with you ? 
 No , I don't often dance . Isn't this a wonderful party ? 
 How do you like fox-trot ? 
 You dance beautifully . 
 Thank you . 
 It's cloudy . 
 I doubt it . 

Would you mind if I smoked ? 

Would you like to go to a concert with me ? 

How should I dress for the party ? 

David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! 
 How was it ? 
 It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? 

Tim's always bothering me . 

I just won the lottery . 

Why is little Billy crying ? 

How was your date with Betty ? 

Who's that ? 

You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? 
 What the hell are you doing now ? 
 What's new with you ? 
 Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? 
 Let me see . What a moving poem ! 
 How many members are there in your forum ? 
 I think we can visit West Lake . The landscapes are attractive . It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth . 
 What can we do next after locating the place ? 

Let's go for a drink after work . 

Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ? 
 Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ? 
 All information is filled in and now I can design my zone . 
 Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ? 
 ( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ? 

I'll come see you tomorrow . 

Are you free tonight ? 
 Would you please go to a dancing party with me ? 
 As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . 
 Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? 
 What are your favourite dances ? 
 How about samba ? 
 Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ? 
 See you then . 
 I have no idea . 
 Not really . 
 Great idea ! I do it every so often . 
 Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? 
 I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . 
 So tricky ! 
 I appreciate that . 
 Yeah , I come here every now and then . 
 I'll have to sleep on it . 
 Think nothing of it . 
 Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . 
 As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . 
 Correct ! What about you , Fred ? 
 Don't overdo it . 
 I get drunk easily . 
 It is free on weekend . 
 Here is a guiding plan . 
 I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . 
 Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ? 
 Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? 
 You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ? 
 What are we waiting for ? Come on ! 

Tom's dating your sister . 

Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ? 
 Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ? 
 I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun . 
 So far I have more than 500 collections . 
 A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . 
 Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something . 
 I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm . 
 No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . 
 You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness . 

Can you give me a ride back home ? 

Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . 
 It is a great place for a relaxing vacation . 
 Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good . 
 Do you mean the red things ? They are roses . 
 Me , too . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 Where is it ? 
 Have you visited it before ? 
 Like what ? 
 Sounds marvelous . 
 Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . 
 Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? 
 It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning . 
 I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . 
 I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . 
 But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it . 
 How much do you want ? 
 I am so sorry to hear that . Is that enough ? 
 Forget it ! We seemingly need to gather money little by little . 
 No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it . 
 Don't count on it . 
 What an idiot ! 
 Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day . 
 Millions of things . I surf the Net , check my e-mail , and most importantly , I chat with my friends . 
 No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me . 

Hello , Kate . 
 I was almost on line the whole night . 
 No , I listened to the music , too . 
 I'm tired . I need a rest . 
 Don't mention it . 
 It's not like him to be late . 
 Tomorrow ? 
 That sounds great . 
 OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect . 
 How about 7 o'clock ? 
 OK . Bye . 

Jenny , do you want to go to see a movie ? 
 I want to see ' Click . ' 
 I don't know . My friend told me it was a touching movie . 
 He can barely make ends meet . 
 It's freezing . 
 Chicken ! 
 I love you , too . 
 Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? 
 No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . 
 I trust you . We'll be happy . 
 It's so beautiful . 
 What is it ? 
 What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ? 
 Oh , dear , I'm so happy . 

What are you guys doing ? 

Honey , what's wrong with you ? 
 Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy . 
 The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby . 

Wait for me 。 

How's work ? 

Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets 
 Here is your ticket . 
 The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . 
 Yes , let's go in . 
 Yes , how do you know ? 
 Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . 

Did you have a good holiday ? 

Sorry . I've got to run . 

Can you recommend a resort to me ? 
 Have you ever been there ? 
 What is especially impressive ? 
 Is there a waterfall ? 
 What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? 

How did you do that ? 

Do you have change for a hundred ? 

See you later , alligator . 

I'm back . 
 Going shopping . It tires me too much . 
 Can I ? 
 OK . What does it sell ? 
 That's great . 
 I'm going to buy a CD . 
 Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? 
 I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . 
 Can you recommend some to me ? 
 Can I download it ? 
 I'll try it tonight . 
 Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . 
 I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . 
 Once in a while . 
 I hope I can practice self-control again . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Sure . What's up ? 
 You too . 
 I had a fantastic time . 
 Coco Lee . 
 She's at home . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Thanks . 
 What a shame ! 
 Same to you . 
 I'm a teacher . 
 It is , isn't it ? 
 It's cool . 
 I like it . It's a beautiful country . 
 The best island of Korea-Jizhou island . 
 Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Why not ? 
 Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? 
 Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? 
 Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? 
 The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? 
 Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? 
 Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . 
 You can't be serious . 
 Are you deaf or what ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 But I can't sing it well . 
 OK , I'Il go with you . When shall we go ? 
 It's too early . Let's make it seven , OK ? 

How's it going ? 

You can't beat me at tennis . 

Excuse me . May I come in ? 

Do you have the time ? 

Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? 
 Good . 

I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight . 
 Hey , that sounds great . 

I'm going to America . 
 I hope before the end of the month . 

Is this seat taken ? 

How was your trip to America ? 
 Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? 

Where's your hometown ? 

I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . 
 Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . 
 The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . 
 They name it after the place where it was first held . 
 This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . 
 Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . 
 He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' . 
 I've told you I'm an expert . 
 Yes , how should I set up my new computer ? 
 Great , thanks a lot . 
 It's January . 
 What for ? ( Why ? ) 
 I'm feeling a little under the weather . 
 I'll just have water . 
 No , thanks . I'm full . 
 Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? 
 Sure , here you go . 
 I'm from Canada . 
 Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . 
 A new car for a start . 
 It's just around the corner . 
 Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . 
 Do you want me to put in a good word for you ? 
 I'm here on business . 
 Can I get you another blanket ? 
 I'll turn the heat up . 

It's awfully hot . 

Thanks a million . 

Why are you laughing ? 

I'll be seeing you around . 

There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? 
 I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . 
 You are right . What about shoes ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . 

Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 
 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 
 I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? 
 Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . 
 You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . 
 For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . 
 I always am . You just didn't notice . 
 Is it formal or informal ? 
 Then , you should dress well . 
 I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you . 
 Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions . 
 The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . 
 It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . 

What's a good place for sightseeing ? 

Freeze ! 

Do you have a light ? 

Excuse me . Nature calls . 

The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . 
 So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? 
 Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? 
 ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? 
 Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? 
 Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . 
 You know , interest is the best teacher . 
 Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . 
 That will be great . 
 I'm surfing the Net . 
 I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . 
 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 
 I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . 
 Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
 Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? 
 Yes , let's do it . 
 Of course not . We don't do that . 
 What ? Are you sure about that ? 
 Where is he going ? 
 What a pity ! 
 I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . 

There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . 
 ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . 
 Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? 
 Those young actors play the roles perfectly . 
 No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . 

What happened to that girl you were seeing ? 
 That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She sounds very emotional . 
 Were you suppose to be there ? 
 Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . 

How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 What about the party ? 
 So how long did you stay ? 

Do you like plum blossoms ? 
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 
 What a heavy snow ! 
 I've got it . I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much . 
 Do you smell the sweet scent ? 
 The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness . 
 I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . 
 Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . 
 I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . 
 I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . 
 He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . 
 A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! 
 Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . 
 My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . 

What is that you have there ? 
 Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone . 
 How about one little hint ? 
 That's a very good hint . 

Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? 
 What is it ? 
 That's it ? That's the tradition ? 
 I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . 

Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . 
 The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . 
 Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . 
 Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . 

Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? 
 I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? 
 Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . 
 I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . 
 What do you think about these shoes ? 
 No . Not really . 
 I bet it's expensive . 
 For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . 
 Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . 
 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . 
 I don't care . I need money . 
 Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . 
 But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . 

Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . 
 Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . 
 ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? 
 Can I have a bite ? 
 Super ! 
 Pardon ? 
 It's 9:30 . 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 It was a good thing I had enough on me . 

Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? 
 Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . 
 Yes , that's her . 
 Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . 
 Where in London do you live ? 
 I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? 

Dad , where are we off to ? 
 Where are we going to have a drink ? 
 Yes ? 
 Good . I will have hot chocolate . 
 When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . 
 I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . 

Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? 
 When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? 
 That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? 
 You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? 
 How do you get enough protein in your diet ? 
 Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? 
 How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? 
 Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . 

Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . 
 You must have seen some other kind of bird . 
 Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . 
 It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . 
 Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . 
 I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . 
 I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . 
 You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . 
 I can't remember . 

Thanks for coming shopping with me . 
 I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . 
 Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . 
 The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? 

Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . 

Do you know where Helen is ? 
 That reminds me . My wedding anniversary is tomorrow . 
 No , what ? 
 You're kidding ! 

What sports do you think women excel at most ? 
 I mean which ones are they better at than men ? 
 That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? 
 Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? 

Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? 
 Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . 
 I like the freedom of summer with no school . 
 And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . 
 And I really like the smells and colors of spring . 
 But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! 
 I won't do it again . Please forgive me . 

How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 Really ? 
 Are you serious ? 

You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . 
 Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! 
 Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! 
 The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . 

I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 
 You mean you didn't know much English then ? 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 
 Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . 

What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . 
 I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . 
 Can I read it when you're finished ? 
 Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . 

I heard Betty lost her tennis match this morning , so she's out of the tournament . 
 Me , too . I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament . 
 Well , that's life . 
 Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? 
 Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ? 
 I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for . 
 I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games . 

My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . 

How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ? 
 He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school . 
 No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . 
 Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable ! 

How annoying ! 
 Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . 

As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . 
 Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . 
 That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . 

I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! 
 Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . 
 I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . 
 I will , thanks for your concern . 

Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . 
 But what are the sources of water pollution ? 
 Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? 
 But what about the indirect ones ? 
 I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . 

I'm tired . 
 Yeah , I need to take a break . 
 What ? 

I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party . 
 I had a wonderful time . 
 I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
 Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . 

Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! 

Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? 
 Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . 
 There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? 
 This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken . I can't wait to use my new hoard . 

David , I heard you lost your job . 
 Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . 
 Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . 
 No , I am German . I live in Munich . 
 And did you like it ? 
 And where are you from , Jack ? 
 What are you studying ? 
 Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ? 
 When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . 
 He said there are only all kinds of good weather . 
 Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . 
 I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us . 
 Mind your own business . 
 Is that right ? 

Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . 
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 
 No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? 
 When did you go there ? 
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 
 I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . 
 Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . 
 Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? 
 Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . 
 That's my style when I'm not in the office . 

Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . 
 That explains it . 
 I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . 
 His girlfriend broke up with him . 

Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages ! 
 What have you been up to ? 
 Good for you ! What are you doing ? 
 I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun ! 

I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? 
 Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? 
 You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . 
 What do you want ? 
 Why not a ring ? 
 But you're ready for everything else ? 

Do you have any year-end benefits ? 
 I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . 
 They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . 
 It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . 

I think I'll write a book . 
 All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . 
 The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype . 
 That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other . 

For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . 
 I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . 
 Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . 
 Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . 

What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . 
 Is that your wedding ring ? 
 Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? 
 Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? 
 You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . 
 What kind of watch is it ? 
 If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? 
 That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . 

There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . 
 That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? 
 What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? 
 That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . 

The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . 
 Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything 
 Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . 
 I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? 
 They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... 
 Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . 
 I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . 
 Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . 
 Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! 
 Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . 
 That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? 
 Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? 
 Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . 
 There are so many things you have to prepare for . 
 It really must be an exciting time for you guys . 

Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? 
 Thanks so much . 
 I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . 
 It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . 

Guess what I just heard ? 
 The boss is planning to sell the company . 

Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? 
 It's George . 

You see that chick over there ? 
 Yeah . Isn't she hot ? 
 Just alright ? ! ? She's hot ! 
 You think she's out of my league ? 
 C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls . 
 What do I talk about ? 
 I don't know ... 
 No . Stay away from her . 
 Ok already . I'll try . 
 Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . 
 I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . 
 Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . 
 Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ? 
 I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday . 
 If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . 
 That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . 
 And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . 
 And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . 
 Not now . 
 Are you kidding ? I just feel tired right now . 
 Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? 
 I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . 
 So how did you propose ? 
 What do you think I should do ? 
 I never thought about that . 
 Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? 
 I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . 

I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . 
 Yep . And I should start planning now . 
 Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . 
 Usually it's at least five days and four nights . 

Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ? 
 My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect . 
 My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? 
 That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ? 

Jack , could you check your calendar ? 
 We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . 

You really look familiar . 
 My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? 
 That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin ! 
 It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ? 

I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ? 
 Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you . 
 I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back . 
 Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters . 

Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? 
 I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? 
 Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? 
 He looks like a very personable man . 

What sport do you like the most ? 
 Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? 
 What position did you play ? 
 I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . 
 I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . 
 I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? 
 We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . 

What sports do you like to play ? 
 How about football ? 
 It's a very popular game in America . 
 For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . 
 No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . 
 Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . 
 Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . 
 Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . 

Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? 
 Do you already have a foursome ? 
 That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? 
 How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . 
 Twilight rates are 21 dollars . 
 Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 
 Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time . 
 Aright . Have fun on Saturday . 

Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? 
 I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . 
 That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . 
 Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . 

Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? 

Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . 
 I don't know yet . 
 I know what you mean . 
 Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . 

There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? 
 There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . 
 So , is that a yes ? 
 It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . 

Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ? 
 Do you sing alto ? 
 Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone . 
 I heard them warming up earlier . You're right . 

It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon . 

The weather has been terrible this week . 
 Let's hope it clears up . 
 Yes , of course , please follow me . 
 This is our courtyard . 
 Yes , about 46 square metres . 
 Yes . 
 They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . 

Hello , this is David . 
 Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? 
 Does five thirty work for you ? 
 Is it the plans for my new house ? 

What stresses you out the most ? 
 How so ? 
 You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . 
 Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . 
 What do you do to deal with the stress ? 
 That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? 

It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . 
 Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . 
 What other activities will you have tomorrow ? 
 Do you bring some gifts along ? 
 Is it the same practice for all families ? 
 I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . 

Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ? 
 I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . 
 You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter . 
 Where is she right now ? 
 Hey , I'll go with you . 
 It's really no problem . 

My name's McDonald . 
 It's M , C , capital D . 
 What kind of food will they be serving ? 
 It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . 
 Do you know the day they plan to open ? 
 Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? 
 We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . 
 What do you think we can see during the festival ? 
 I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . 
 Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . 
 You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ? 

I have an idea for Christmas this year . 
 Let's not exchange any gifts at all . 
 Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! 
 Actual 1y , it was their idea first . 

Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? 
 Of course . 
 Where did you say ? 
 Right . 
 Sure . I've got a copy here . It's due for renewal at the end of next month . We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy . 
 Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . 
 While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . 
 I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . 
 ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . 
 I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . 
 Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too . 
 We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station . 
 ( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge . 
 Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . 
 We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . 

I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday . 
 Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? 
 Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? 
 I don't know how old he is though . 

Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ? 
 My name is Phil . What's yours ? 
 Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good . 
 Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some . 

We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? 
 Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! 
 Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . 
 Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! 

When do you want to have the open house party ? 
 Friday sounds good . 
 I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . 
 I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own . 

I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ? 
 I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid . 
 How Ay clients do you have already ? 
 Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework . 

Do you like flowers ? 
 What's your favorite flower ? 
 Spring is a lively season . 
 I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . 
 It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . 
 The bright people will remember it forever . 

What date is today ? 
 Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? 
 Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . 

Why are you so quiet ? 
 You must feel terrible now . 
 I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . 
 Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . 
 I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . 
 You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . 
 I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? 
 I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . 

Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? 
 So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . 
 I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? 

Hey Jack . How's it going ? 
 What ! With who ? 
 Did you guys go on a date already ? 
 Does she have a boyfriend ? 
 Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . 
 So why do you think you're in love ? 
 That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week . 

The National Day is coming . What are you going to do during the holiday ? 
 Why don't you go sightseeing ? 
 I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest . 
 My grandmother just passed away . 
 A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . 
 No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . 
 Yeah . She died in her sleep . 
 At least she didn't suffer . 
 I know . But I miss her . 
 Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . 
 You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go . 
 Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? 
 May I have a look at your costume ? 
 I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . 
 Haha . Wish you good luck . 
 Jake just broke up with me . 
 Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . 
 But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . 
 Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him 
 I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . 
 Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . 
 Sure . 
 Thank you . Same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend's , and you ? 

When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ? 
 What do you eat on that day ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I'm almost hungry . 
 He's the nicest boss I've had . 
 What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! 
 I hope so . 
 Merry Christmas . Steven ! 
 I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ? 
 I'd love to . But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now . See you later . 

She is so beautiful , isn't she ? 
 Julia Roberts . 
 It's said that her new movie is going to come out . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities . 

Merry Christmas , Lily . 
 This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . 
 Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . 
 I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ? 
 I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ? 
 Oh , the history books are dull to me . 
 Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . 
 Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . 
 Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . 
 I think the campaign is a blockbuster . 
 Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . 
 It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . 
 Maybe . Who knows ? 
 Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . 
 Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . 
 I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . 
 Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? 
 Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . 
 In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . 
 You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ? 
 I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ? 
 Maybe ! 
 What's going on ? 
 So what happened ? 
 So what does that have to do with this position ? 
 All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . 
 Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . 

Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 At the gate of the park . 
 See you then . 

Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? 
 But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! 
 But ... But ... 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Hi , how are you doing ? 
 Glad to meet you , Wang Lin . I am Mary . 
 Yes . My company has an office here , and I have just been transferred . 
 Great . I would like that . 
 It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' . 
 How did you like the movie ? 
 I can't say I agree . 
 I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . 

I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . 
 I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . 
 Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . 

Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ? 
 What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ? 
 Then when do you think we could go out together ? 
 OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me . 

Hello ! 
 Yes . 
 Just a minute please . Oh , I'm sorry , all the tickets for tonight have been sold out . 
 Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ? 
 OK , your name and telephone number please . 
 Yes , of course . 

Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . 
 But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . 

What is the movie you saw last night ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . 
 My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . 
 It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . 
 Let's go . The time is coming . 

Who's that man over there talking to James ? 
 He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? 
 Really ? I love eccentric people . 
 Why ? What do you mean by that ? 
 Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . 
 Really ! How fascinating . 
 Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . 

Did you say you saw lily alone ? 
 Where did you say she was ? 
 I must say I think that is very odd . Are you absolutely certain it was her ? 
 Because I don't want any , er , do you understand ? But you are quite sure , are you ? 

Would you like to go to the movies tonight ? 
 Well , we could see something different like a detective film . 
 How about a comedy ? 
 How about a love story then ? 
 What's you opinion ? 
 Really ? 
 No , but I can't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie . 
 Sorry , we have sold out the tickets . 
 ' Beautiful Mind ' will be playing again . And there's also ' Titanic ' . 
 Yes , 20 yuan for each . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ? 
 Are there any good seats left ? 
 Well , what time does it begin ? 
 OK . I see . 
 Just two . 
 Here is the money . 
 Good idea . Is there a good movie on ? 
 All right . But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose . 
 What time does it begin ? 
 I'll come for you at about eight . 

Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ? 
 I just want to make sure that there is possibility of giving us a loan . 

But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice . 
 She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . 

There's a new play tonight . 
 ' Romeo and Juliet ' . 
 It's about their great love . 
 Of course . Do you want to see it ? 
 No , I don't . 
 Good idea . Let's goa 

How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ? 
 What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you . 

The show will be starting in a few minutes . We'd better go in and find our seats . 
 That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Well , how did you like the show ? 

Would you like to stretch your legs ? 
 Let's get a soft drink . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . 
 Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? 
 Do you have concert halls in your city ? 
 Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . 

How do you like the play ? 
 You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better . 
 Maybe you're right . But I really don't like it . 
 Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . 

David , do you think we are lucky to have the weekend ? 
 I agree with you . What do you want to do , except sleeping ? 
 I am better . I will go out to have a visit to my aunt . Why don't we have fun on weekend ? 

Do you like cooking ? 
 Why do you like it ? 
 That's wonderful ! 
 Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . 

Hello , is this People's Theater ? 
 Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ? 
 October 16th . 
 7:30 p . m . performance , please . 
 I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please . 
 Du Kun . 
 Tomorrow . 
 How do we cancel , just in case ? 
 All right , thank you very much . Good bye . 

Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? 
 Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . 
 No wonder you are named shopaholic . 
 Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . 
 My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . 
 God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . 
 I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . 

Can I borrow your suit ? 

Do you like ethnic food ? 
 Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? 
 I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . 
 As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . 

Thanks for helping me move into my new house . 

What do you do in your spare time ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 Who is your favorite author ? 
 Are you a music lover ? 
 What kinds of films do you enjoy ? 

Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? 
 It's a deal . 
 Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me . 
 That's for sure . I feel like I'm melting . 
 Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . 

Ouch ! 
 Yeah , I just bumped into the table . 
 Yes , I can . 
 Yes , it's very interesting . 
 Sure . Take the tennis racket . Now , throw the ball up , and hit it with the racket . Like this . 
 Throw the ball up high . 
 Yes , very high . Over your head . Then you will have time to hit the ball . 
 Well done ! 

Have you heard Jenny divorced her French husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 That ’ s true . She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things . 
 You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? 
 I can tell it from your build . 
 I know . It's going to be so much fun . 
 I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . 
 That makes sense . 
 Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited . 
 Looks like anything fun makes you excited . 
 Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field . 
 Good boy ! 
 How's it ? 

Have we met ? 
 Hello , Michael . My name's Shirley . Pleased to meet you . 
 I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ? 

Where are you going for your trip ? 
 But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! 
 Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . 
 The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . 
 You are quite right . 
 OK . Shall we go to a bar ? 
 Why ? 
 Don't you think it ’ s too noisy here ? The rock music ! I can hardly bear it . 
 Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me . 

I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . 
 Oh , he's a very serious person . 

Why is the long face ? 
 Did you just get your review or something ? 
 That sucks . 
 Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . 
 Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . 
 Now you're talking . 
 Basketball , football , table tennis . I will watch them on TV . 
 Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA . 
 I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ? 
 Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . ' 
 Good idea . I will take the racket . 
 Come on in . Would you care for a drink ? 

Would you like to have some more wine ? 
 Say when . 
 Yes . I did . 

How about seconds , Victor ? 

Hello , Mrs . Taylor . I'm here to pick up Diane . 

Good afternoon , Sam . 
 What are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ? 
 I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . 
 It doesn't matter , I can teach you . 

I like NBA very much . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Do you like NBA ? 
 Who do you like best of the NBA players ? 
 So do I . 
 That's fine . 
 I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails . 
 That ’ s good . 
 Thank you . Oh , it tastes excellent . 
 Yes . Table tennis is probably the most popular . 
 Most anyway . 
 Yes , I like . But I can't play it well . 
 Basketball and swimming are very popular . 
 We can play together if you are free . 

Hey , Mike , is Jenny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I'm just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? ! 
 Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . 
 I'd totally die if she turned me down . 
 I don't know ... Well , maybe , you're right , but how am I going to tell her ? 
 Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? 
 Then we'd better not go . 

Honey , would you marry me ? 
 Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . 
 Oh , god , please tell me how . 
 OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you . 
 Yes , I would . Thanks for being in my life . 

Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! 
 Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high ! 
 Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . 
 Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . 
 Are you serious ? 
 But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 Hey , come on . It's too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 But I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ... 
 Have you made the decision yet ? 
 Then shall we keep pure friendship ? 

Hi , Jack , how have you been ? 
 Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? 
 Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . 
 Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . 
 Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! 

You don't look too well . What's going on ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? 
 That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? 
 I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . 
 No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . 
 I'm from Guangzhou . 
 It's in the South of China . 
 Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! 
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! 
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! 
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . 
 I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . 
 I guess so . 

Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ? 
 What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? 
 For me , I think starting school was more exciting . 
 It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . 
 That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . 

Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ? 
 Yes , I do . 

Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? 
 Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . 
 I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . 
 We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . 

I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 Can you stay for dinner ? We'd love to have you join us . 

What a hot day ! 
 Where are you going this summer vacation ? 
 Do you want to go to the beach there ? 
 The same to you . 

It's one of the highlights of the match . 
 The wonderful passing Melaena did . 

What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? 
 Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . 

What's up , buddy ? You look so upset . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? 
 Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . 
 Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . 
 And good shot ! 

Mary , how was your date with John ? 
 Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . 
 That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . 
 But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . 
 There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it . 
 I suppose he's not in top form . 
 They aren't evenly matched . 
 Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet . 
 Next week . 

I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa . 
 I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . 
 That's correct . 

Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock . 
 I've got to catch the last bus . See you later . 
 Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . 
 I think I'm quite fit for a driver . 
 I don't care . 
 I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation . 
 I'm out of work at the moment . 
 I was fired last week . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job . 
 Thank you . 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it ’ s just one of those things . 
 Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor . 
 They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see . 
 Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . 
 Hello ! 
 Yeah , my name is Nandu . 
 Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U . 
 I'm from Madras . 
 The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . 
 It doesn't seem to be so easy . 
 No , it's the Japanese team . 
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 
 They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . 
 No way , if it still has 21 . 
 Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks . 
 No , once I did 32 . 
 Did you see his last dive . 
 He's diving for the gold . 
 Nothing much . What are you up to ? 
 He took the civil service exam and failed . 
 Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . 
 That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . 
 Sounds good . 
 The Spur . 
 They managed a 99:80 victory . 
 Yes . I like winter . 
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 
 What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . 
 I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . 
 There is a snowman over there . 

I'm sure he was off-side . 
 I think he favors the host team . 

Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? 
 Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? 
 Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . 
 You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . 
 His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . 

Which team has won ? 
 But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 

I like the kid . He's so lovely . 
 Twelve . He's very sensible for his age . 
 Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . 
 That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . 
 In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . 
 Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? 
 Maybe you are right . 
 I like collecting stamps . 
 Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Do you play basketball well ? 
 Shall we have a game together some day ? 

Hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? 
 It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . 
 Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . 
 I like rumba and tango . 
 You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier . 
 Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? 
 Sounds pleasant . 
 It's OK . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . 
 He didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? 
 Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging . 

What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Really ? 
 They are beautiful . You did a good job . 
 As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . 
 Just watching some TV . 
 Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . 
 Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? 
 You wanna shoot some hoops ? 
 Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . 
 Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then . 
 I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way . 
 Aright . See you there . 
 Don't believe him . He's a liar . 
 Exactly . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 

Hi , Tina , it's Joe . 
 What's the weather like there today ? 
 What's the temperature ? 
 Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? 
 I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . 
 It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . 
 Oh , hi ! 
 Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? 
 Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? 
 I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? 
 Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . 
 See you around ! 

What a beautiful day ! 
 I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today . 
 Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York . 

Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
 Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . 

Hello ? 
 Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . 
 I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored . 
 I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? 
 Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 That's great . We can do something outdoors then . 
 Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . 
 Do you know what time it starts ? 
 Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there . 

How are you doing ? 
 What movies have you seen lately ? 
 What type of movie is that ? 
 I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . 
 What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? 
 Out of those what is your favorite ? 
 What is your favorite computer game ? 
 If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? 
 That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? 
 I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . 
 Great . I'll see you on Saturday . 

Steve . Is that you ? 
 Not much . What a surprise to see you here . 
 What have you been up to ? 
 Really ? Where do you work out at ? 
 What do you mostly do during your workout ? 
 I should start exercising more . 
 I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . 
 If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . 
 Aright . I'll talk to you later . 

I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . 
 Why ? 

I really should be on my way . 
 No , thanks all the same . 
 Thank you very much . I really had a good time . 
 So see you . 

Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China . 
 We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties . 
 Smaller local companies . We specialize in trade & shipping industry . 

Ann , do you have time next Monday ? 
 Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party . 
 Great ! 
 Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? 
 I am going to invite other guys . See you that day . 

Do you like playing table tennis ? 
 When did you start it ? 

Is there any more vodka in that bottle ? 
 Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . 
 So Irene , what do you do ? 
 Macrohard , eh ? 
 I have my own company that designs computer systems . 
 Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . 
 Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . 
 Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . 
 Really ? What makes you say that ? 
 I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 Yes , I'll have another cocktail . 
 Absolutely . 
 OK . I'll wait here for you . 
 Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . 
 Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . 
 Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . 
 Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . 
 Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? 
 Oh , come on . Everybody knows . 
 Oh , sure . 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 You can ask her out for drinks after work . 
 Then you've got a lot of work to do . You need to get her to notice you first . 
 You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . 
 That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . 
 Good luck ! 
 Thank you , Peter . 
 Happy birthday , Peter , and many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . 
 What wish do you make ? 

Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ? 
 Your garden is really lovely . 
 Do you take care of them everyday ? 
 Don't you feel dull ? 

Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days . 
 Love sick . You know who she's in love with ? 
 Someone you're living with . 
 Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . 
 The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him . 
 Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . 
 Me too . 
 Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night . 
 When will your vacation end ? 
 You will go back tomorrow , right ? 

My eyes water continuously . Why ? 
 What is there in the air ? 
 I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty . 
 So do I . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already . 
 Neither of us is very religious , so we decided not to get married there . 
 Yes . The Palace Hotel . You have to be there . 

How time flies ! 
 I can still remember our first date . 
 Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there . 
 You seemed to be dull at that time . 
 ( Smile ) I can ’ t believe this for it ’ s been 20 years since we got married . 
 I couldn ’ t have been any happier ! 

Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ? 
 Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly . 
 Swimming . What about you ? 

Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ? 

May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ? 
 2:30 , please . 
 Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ? 
 Here is 50 yuan . 
 I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please ! 
 You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway . 
 Let's go in to wait for them . 

Table-tennis is our national game . 
 I can't , either . I like watching . 
 I am interested in watching TV or other relaxing games . 
 I usually read or entertain myself . 
 My favorite books are those about detectives . 
 When it comes to the entertainment , I think I enjoy dancing . There is nothing I like more than modern dance . 
 Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? 
 Yes , I guess I should try to use it . 
 So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . 
 Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . 
 Actually , tears also came to my eyes . 
 It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . 
 Yes , Friday I have a class right after work . 
 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What's up ? 
 No . Did you want to go do something ? 
 Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? 
 I'll be right back . I just need to mail this package . 
 Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ? 
 It will be held at the Central Music Hall . 
 It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 . 

Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . 
 Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
 Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 

Did your wife give birth yet ? 
 Congratulations . How is your wife doing ? 
 That's good to hear . 
 If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? 
 That's normal for anyone with a newborn . 
 You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health . 

I've been thinking about getting my hair cut . 
 I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it . 
 Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy . 
 Everywhere I go ? 

Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again . 
 Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? 
 Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . 
 What does she like to do ? 
 Hmm . Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes . 
 Have you thought about going Dutch ? 
 Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . 

What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ? 
 Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ? 
 Can you tell me why you like it ? 

Which pair of jeans do you like best ? 
 But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? 
 That's the style ! You just wear boxers . 
 You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! 

We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? 
 You come dressed in anything from the sixties . 
 Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . 
 That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? 

Look , my clothes are wet . 
 Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . 
 The Dai people are enthusiastic . 

Mum , I have something for you today . 
 Don't you remember ? Today is March 8th . It's Women's Day . 
 Now , close your eyes . ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand . ) 
 Happy Women's Day . I love you forever , Mum . 
 No , I didn't . 

Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk . 

Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . 
 I sure hope so . 
 They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day . 
 Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead . 
 People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead . 
 I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . 
 Sure . Is it your father's birthday ? 
 Oh ! How could I forget such an important holiday ? 
 Yes , let's go . 
 The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter . 
 We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March . 
 We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray . 

Mom , happy Mother's Day ! A necklace for you . 
 Thank you for your love and care over the years . I love you so much . 
 How about a dinner tonight ? My treat . 
 All right . Let me prepare the supper . 
 I'm tired of Mexican food . Besides , you picked the restaurant last week . 

Do you mind retiring earlier ? 
 I do . I don't know what to do after I retire . I'd like to work till I drop . 
 Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . 
 We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan . 
 We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . 

Would you like to join the drama club ? 
 Why do you want to join it ? 

Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? 
 It seems you're very fond of it . 

Would you allow me to drive your car ? 
 Surely I will . 

My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 What happens on the holiday ? 
 Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ? 

Do you need a ticket ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 You can be assured of it . 
 Oh , I'm a little busy these days . 
 Don ’ t you know Christmas is coming ? I have a lot of things to get ready . 
 Yeah , so I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave . 
 Americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends . 
 I will . Merry Christmas . 
 Fine , just don't do it at night . 
 The cold weather will damage the engine . 
 That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot . 

I'd like to meet you again sometime . 
 Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 Bye , Jason . 
 I didn't make the soccer team . 

How can I live without Helen ? 

What do you do in your spare time ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 What kind of things do you paint ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 

Hey Bobby . What's going on ? 
 I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? 
 Thanks . 
 Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . 
 You ever tried to quit ? 
 Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . 
 I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later . 

Do you have any habits such as smoking ? 
 What kind of winter sport do you like best ? 
 What do you like doing in your spare time ? 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 

Happy New Year , Bill . 
 Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday ? 
 How happy you are ! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam . 
 Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . 
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 
 They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 

Did you take my money from the table ? 

Can you read what this says ? 
 Don't dis my hair ! I like it like this . 
 Hey , that's enough about my hair . 
 I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute . 

Tom's new business will do well . 

Who do you think is going to get the Oscar for best actor ? 

I don't stand a chance of passing the exam . 

I don't think the manager will get mad at you for being late . 

I want to redo this poster , but John and Mary think it's good enough as it is . 

Did you know Carl is almost fifty ? 
 He told me so himself . 
 On this occasion , most people do . 
 She is a beautiful bride . 
 Are you crying ? 
 Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . 
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 
 For the wedding ? 
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 
 Certainly . You are more welcome to do . What is it ? 
 Well , if spicy local dishes are what you are looking for , In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go . The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes . You might want to try there . 
 It is near the university . Five minutes ' walk from your flat , I think . 
 You're welcome . May you have a good time . Please give my regards to your wife . I wish her a happy birthday tomorrow . 

What are your plans for today ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm ? 

Tom , did you see the film last night ? 
 Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
 Well , I don't see the point of arguing this . 
 Hey , Anna , this is Jason . 
 Yes . How are you , Anna ? 
 Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . 
 Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . 
 You are kidding . 
 A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . 
 She is very nice and open-minded . 
 Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots . 
 Good . Tonight 8 o'clock . 
 Bye . 
 Thank you , Peter . Come into the dining room . We are going to cut the cake soon . 
 That's Cathy . She is pretty , isn't she ? She likes dancing . Ask her to dance . 
 Don't be afraid . She isn't going to bite you . 

Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! 
 Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type . 
 Where did you learn to sing like that ? 
 You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ? 

Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ? 

That is the most beautiful sunset ! 
 Here is a good place . Let's get out . 
 Mother Nature is quite an artist . 
 Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere ! 

Are you free tomorrow , Sam ? 
 I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? 
 You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner . 
 Yes , but not the Ritz Carlton , the " Ritz " is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor . 
 I'll wait right here for you Superman . 
 Can we go to the Carlton next time and can you wear that fabulous suit ? 
 Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . 
 Yeah . And I never want to go again . 
 That's exactly how I feel now . 
 Ha . There won't be a next time . 
 I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . 
 No . What ? 
 No . Really , what happened ? 
 Was he out with the guys from the bank ? 
 Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . 
 Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . 
 Oh , really ? Do you know why ? 
 He lost his wallet and keys . 
 Oh , no . 
 So then what happened ? 
 Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . 

What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? 
 Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . 

Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ? 
 Are you enjoying married life ? 
 You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that . 
 Do you guys do anything special ? 
 Sound like everything is great . 
 Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . 
 Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? 

Did you hear what happened to Mike last night ? 
 Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ? 
 Well , I don't know the details , but ... 
 Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Fine , thank you , and you ? 
 I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block . 
 Yes , thanks . Did you ? 
 I went to Tamshui . You ? 

Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ? 
 Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant . 
 Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening 
 Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . 
 There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . 
 Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . 
 First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' 
 You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . 

Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 
 What ’ s the score ? 
 So Baltimore is winning ? 
 This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . 
 The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . 
 Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . 
 What are you so excited about ? 
 What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . 
 There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . 
 No , how much is it worth ? 
 Whoa . 
 No , why ? 
 Sure I like shopping . Who is organizing the party ? 
 What's the occasion ? 
 That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . 
 Leave it to me . I know exactly where to find it . 
 Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need . 
 Good morning , Pete . 
 Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week . 
 That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . 
 And when is your birthday ? 
 My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . 
 Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now . 
 Now that's a great plan . It's a date ! 
 Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . 
 Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . 
 Sure , more elegant and taller . 
 If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . 

Um , what will you do this weekend ? 
 A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? 
 Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . 
 Would you like orchestra seats ? 
 Not unless you want the matinee . 
 Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . 
 If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . 
 Have you found a suitable job ? 
 But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing . 

Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? 
 Aren't there any other seats ? 

Hello ? 
 Hi Joe . 
 It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . 
 It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . 
 I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . 
 Me too . How's the weather where you are ? 

Are there any seats left for Saturday night ? 
 I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ? 

Give me Scotch , please . 
 Black Rose . 
 Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . 

So Emily , what do you like to do for fun ? 
 I also like going to the movies . 

Did you do anything fun over the weekend ? 
 Why didn't you want to go out ? 
 Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ? 

Last weekend I didn't want to go out either , so I stayed at home and played video games by myself . It was really fun ! 
 Yeah , I'm really into video games . In fact , all my friends are on the Internet . I've never met any of them in the real world . 

Hello ? 
 Are you there yet ? 
 I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late . 
 Where are you ? 
 Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ? 
 What ? 
 Oh , OK . What are you doing there ? 
 Do you want to get something to eat later ? 
 What do you want to do ? 
 OK , see you soon . 

We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ? 
 It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic . 

Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ? 
 Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water . 
 The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? 
 That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . 
 Not really , I like watching horror movies , like ' The Unborn . ' 
 I like horror movies because I like to be scared . 
 Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . 
 We can go to a horror movie , and I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared . 
 Of course ! Or are you still too scared ! 

Did you like the play ? 
 You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . 

Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 

It's snowing heavily . 
 The snow is so beautiful . 
 From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa . 
 Although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm . 

It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ? 
 Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ? 
 Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work . 
 Yeah , that's fine . 
 233-331-8828 . Let me give you my email address too . It's Tom861@gmail.com 
 OK . 
 I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ? 
 Well , it may not be that simple . Not everyone likes public transport . 
 Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know . 
 I'm planing to go bowling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? 
 Why not ? 

Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ? 
 I see . 
 OK , I will . 
 What is its national anthem ? 
 Can you sing the song ? 

I immigrated here last year . 
 I am an engineer in a mechanized farm . 
 Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . 
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too . 
 excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
 Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ? 
 Matinee or evening ? 
 Circle or stalls ? 
 Wonderful , I'll go with you . 
 There are some seats in the rear mezzanine . 
 No , the show is almost sold out . 
 That sounds great . Where are you going ? 
 What should I bring ? 

So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ? 
 You know what comedy I really like ? " Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . " I think Jim Carry is really funny . 
 I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is " Titanic . " 
 Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . 
 It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . 

Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? 
 We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . 
 And don't forget your fishing tackle . 

You like Titanic ? That movie is so cheesy . 
 Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy . 
 Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially " Terminator . " 
 Well ... I saw it only once , but for the next two months when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator . 
 Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time . 
 All right . There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third . 
 There won't be many other expenses expect food . 
 I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird . 
 Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule . 
 Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . 
 No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . 
 The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . 
 I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . 
 If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . 
 I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . 
 It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . 
 Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . 
 If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . 
 Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . 
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . 
 To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
 Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . 
 He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . 
 Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . 
 Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . 
 And the host announced that he won it all ! 
 Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
 As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . 
 What is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
 I see , so it's similar to global warming ? 
 I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
 People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 

Hello 
 Hi B . How are you ? 
 I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ? 
 No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? 
 Yes . Did you forget ? 
 That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . 
 Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other . 
 Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . 

Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? 
 I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . 
 Got that . 
 Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? 
 Ok , I can see that road . 
 Good , I can see the library on the map . 
 That's great , see you at seven . 
 I'm still a student . 
 Boston University . 
 I'm studying English , math , and history . My major is English . 
 More than six years . 
 Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school . 
 Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice . 
 Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet . 
 Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come . 
 Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . 
 Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . 
 So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . 
 You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? 
 Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . 
 I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . 
 Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . 
 I don't like things to be fancy . 
 Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? 
 Well , let's take the measurements right now . 
 No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ? 
 Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ? 
 Yeah . Other than that , the real feature is the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? 
 Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ? 
 I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention . 
 Oh , fresh juice , I love it . Well , I heard American people love hanging out in bars . Is that true ? 
 Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great . 
 Maybe later . I wanna take some photos first . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ? 
 I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ? 
 Which one is that ? 
 Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . 
 What time ? 
 That's good . See you on Friday . 
 Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . 
 They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . 
 She is certainly not my kind of girl . 
 You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . 

Do you know the highest mountain in the world ? 
 Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth . 
 Have people set foot on its peak ? 

Do you know something about Mount Tai ? 
 Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? 
 Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? 
 I want to see them . How can I go there ? 

Jack , what are you doing ? 
 I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ? 
 Can I have a look as well ? 
 Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . 
 Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . 
 Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? 

Have you seen the new James Bond movie ? 
 Yes . What did you think of it ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ? 
 Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? 
 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ? 
 I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond ! 

I hear you are expecting your family . 
 I didn't know you had a brother . 
 Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? 
 Does your brother have just one son ? 
 I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . 
 So when are they all coming ? 

Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ? 
 What kind of job are you applying for ? 
 Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job . 
 Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . 
 Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . 
 No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
 What was that like ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did you get any perks on the job ? 

Have you found a new job yet ? 
 What kind of work ? 
 What do you do there ? 
 How long is the assignment ? 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 That ’ s a big family . How old is your brother ? 
 What about your sister ? 
 Do you miss your family ? 
 Do you often go home ? 
 How often do you call to them ? 

What are you doing tomorrow ? 
 Let's watch a movie or something . 
 I think they're playing Lord of the Rings 
 Where should we meet ? 
 Aright . I'll meet you there at one o'clock . 
 I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction . 
 Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for . 
 Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious . 

What should we do this Saturday ? 
 Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good . 
 True . Ok . Let's see it this Saturday . 
 Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy . 
 I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . 
 I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities . 
 Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 
 Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters . 
 No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother . 
 That's right , Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters . 
 Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again . 
 Yes . She is Sarah's step-mother . 
 They want to travel to Europe next year , and will visit us at the same Ae . 
 Yes , I did . Did you ? 
 Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ? 

Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . 
 Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . 
 Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? 
 Oh , no . 
 I would think this was the least they could do . 
 Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . 

You know Ernie , it seems we both like the same artists . 
 But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance . Can you do that ? 
 Great ! I'll sing , and you can dance in our band . 
 Well , all my friends listen to it , so I became a big fan too . 
 I'm a big fan of Snoop Dog . 
 You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . 
 Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . 
 I listen to a lot of hip hop . What about you ? 
 Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like . 
 Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool ! 
 I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds . 
 Well I always hear it on the radio , so I started to get into it . 
 I totally agree ! 
 I met Amanda through a friend . 
 We started dating right away . 
 Yes . 
 No , what ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Crikey . Where did this happen ? 
 Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there . 
 So what happened ? 
 That's terrible . 
 So what happened next ? 
 Well , he sure was lucky . 

Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . 
 That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . 
 That's OK . You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them . 
 Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal . 
 Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy . 
 My roommate invited both of us to dinner . 
 Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . 
 I met her about one year ago . 
 That's right . We've been dating since last September . 
 Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us . 
 Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type . 
 I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . 
 Well ... that's a long story . 
 Really ? Why ? What happened ? 
 Oh , no . 
 So what did you do ? 
 You what ? 
 Wow , good for you . 
 Oh , no ! 
 You really have bad luck , don't you ? 

So Kevin , what is your type ? 
 I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh . 

What's the time now ? 
 You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? 
 You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . 
 All right . It's just four o'clock . 
 You are welcome . 
 OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? 
 OK . 
 I see . 
 Oh , that's funny ! 
 Oh , sorry . 
 A car door ? You mean just one car door ? 
 Well ... 
 You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . 
 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . 
 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 
 Well , here we go again . 
 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? 
 Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . 

What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
 How hard is the climb ? 
 What did you do last week ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . 
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! 

Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 
 I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . 
 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 
 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating . 
 Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . 
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
 Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . 

Hello , Mike , long time no see . How's everything going ? 
 He caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now . 
 I sure will . Thanks . 
 Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . 
 Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! 
 Here comes Jordan , though . 
 Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . 
 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
 Yes , why ? 
 So ? 
 That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? 
 That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 
 And you think about her all the time ? 
 And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . 
 Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . 
 Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . 

So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? 
 You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? 

How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . 
 No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? 

Good game ? 
 Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? 
 Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . 
 16 . Yours ? 
 Jane . Nice to meet you . 
 Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? 
 Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . 
 Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? 
 How awful , poor guy . 
 Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? 

Have you seen this ? 
 They killed another hostage . 
 I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? 
 Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? 
 Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 Oh , sure . 
 He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . 
 I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . 

The weather is terrible . 
 I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . 
 I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . 
 I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . 
 I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . 
 Great . I'll stop by your place now . 

Are you busy with your work ? 
 Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . 
 Just so so . But we can travel twice every year . 
 Yes , we won't travel again until October . 

How's your work ? 
 Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately . 
 Because of the low salaries . 
 I don't know why . 
 May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . 
 Yeah . It's already December , you know . 

Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes . 
 OK . See you later . 
 No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . 
 I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . 
 Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? 
 Do you like your job ? 
 Which kind of news do you catch ? 
 Are you feel tired ? 
 You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . 

Nice day , isn't it ? 
 It's a good day for a picnic . 
 I'm going to a disco with my friends . 

What time shall I pick you up ? 
 That'll be fine . See you soon . 
 Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? 
 Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? 
 How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun . 
 That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class . 

Hi . You enjoying the party ? 
 Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way . 
 I'm in finance . You ? 
 T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ? 
 No . Actually , I'm based in Shanghai . I'm just here for the conference . So , T & D eh ... 
 I'm at home painting . 
 I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . 
 Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . 

Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? 
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 
 Sounds nice . 
 Can I stop by ? 

A funny thing happened to me the other day . 
 I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . 
 Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . 
 Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . 
 You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! 
 Oh , yes . You ? 
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? 
 Mmm . That's what I thought , too . And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . 
 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . 

Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? 
 Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll take it . 
 Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . 

Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . 
 Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! 
 I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . 
 Yes , I like collecting antiques . 
 I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . 
 Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? 
 Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? 

I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 

Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 
 I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . 
 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 
 Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . 
 Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . 

I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 
 Is it due to old age or is he sick . 
 That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . 
 Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . 

It's snowing outside . 
 Let's go out and have a look . 
 Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . 
 I love winter , I love snow . 
 But I like cold more than hot . 

The weather is terrible . 
 I'm wearing my heavy jacket . 
 Will it snow today ? 
 Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . 
 Good idea . 
 Say what you want to say . 
 I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . 
 Stay for dinner with us . 
 Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me . 
 Goodbye . Thank you again for coming . 
 Yes , it's so cold . 
 Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon . 
 About two months . 
 I'm used to this kind of days . 
 Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then . 

What do you do when you are angry ? 
 That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? 
 Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? 
 I think that might work for me as well . 
 Like what ? 

The time has come to say goodbye . 
 I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . 
 I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around . 
 You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? 
 I'll be expecting you then . 
 Today is Thursday . 
 Today is May first , 2003 . 
 Well , I don't think so . 
 Hi , Tom . How have you been ? 

Hello , Mary . How are you ? 
 Fine . Thank you . 
 Well , most of the time it is , I guess . 
 I think money will make me happy . 
 It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . 
 Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . 
 You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . 
 Really ? Well , thanks for saying so . 
 Sure . Why not ? 
 OK . 
 Fine ! How about you ? 

Mr . Clinton , it's nice to see you again . 
 Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ? 

Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . 
 It doesn't matter . Forget it . 
 Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . 
 There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . 
 It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . 
 I am seven . 
 Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now . 
 Yes , come on , and we will have fun . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker . 
 Oh , she is going to be a great mother . 
 Do you mean lying to people for their good ? 
 It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . 
 I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . 
 Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . 
 Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 

Have you considered upgrading your system ? 
 You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . 
 You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . 
 You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? 
 Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . 

Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 
 Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ? 
 Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . 
 Wow , this thing can haul . 
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 
 Wow , this car can really burn rubber . 
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 

How is your new car ? 
 Why do you say so ? Can I see your new car ? 
 Wow , this new car is dynamite ! It is a shiny , beautiful car . 
 The car has very sleek lines . I love it . 
 You made a good choice . 
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . 
 At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . 
 Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . 
 Thank you ! 
 The Palace Hotel . 
 It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . 

Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? 
 How sweet . 
 When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? 

Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you . 
 Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice . 
 They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 

Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An . 
 I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? 
 Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together . 

Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? 
 I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling " help " . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman . 
 I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help . 
 Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help . 
 I graduated from Songhua University . 
 I graduated from it in 2002 . 
 Was it quite special ? 
 Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? 
 Oh , your classmates took you in . 

I think it's about time that we had to go . 
 I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . 
 Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality . 

Happy Thanksgiving ! 
 Let's have pumpkin pie . 

Have a nice Thanksgiving ! 
 Are you going anywhere ? 
 Oh , I'll probably just stay at home . 
 That's nice of you . 
 Wonderful . 
 When is it ? 
 Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? 
 Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? 
 It sounds so moving . 
 I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . 
 I am interested in science fiction . 
 In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . 
 You are deadly right . 
 Not really , do you ? 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 
 That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? 

That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . 
 I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . 
 Such as ? 
 They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . 
 What does this mean ? 
 I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . 
 What special effects ? 
 That's great ! 
 So everybody's getting video mail . 
 No , it is the original one . 
 I have changed a case for it . 
 Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . 
 There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . 

Do you think the bad weather will last long ? 
 I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . 
 Good idea . Thanks a billion . 
 Why not send them short messages ? 
 Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . 
 I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . 
 I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . 
 Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? 
 No , not yet . 
 You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . 
 Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . 
 Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . 
 It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? 
 Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . 
 Any other common customs of your New Year ? 
 What's that ? 
 By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . 
 A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . 
 Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . 
 I've got to be going now too . 
 See you later . 
 Yes , the snow is often falling thick and fast here . 
 Yes , It's really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow . 
 There are so many places around . Take a look at the advertisement . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Green . 
 I'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . 
 Please come in for a cup of coffee . 

It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . 
 Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . 
 Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . 
 There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . 
 Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . 
 Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? 
 When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . 

It's getting late , and I have to go now . 
 Please excuse me , won't you ? 

Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . 
 I hope it will be of some use to you . 
 That will be great . 
 That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it . 
 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ? 
 See you ! 
 OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . 
 You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . 
 It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . 
 Okay ! What do you suggest ? 
 Is that so ? Why not ? 
 What's on ? 
 That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? 
 What time does it start ? 
 But we won't have enough time for dinner . 
 Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . 
 That's Okay , I think . 

Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you . 
 I hope you will like it . 

The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . 
 Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . 
 Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . 
 They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . 
 Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money . 
 Of course the children . 
 That's great . 
 Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . 

What's that , a new video game ? 
 For instance ? 
 Wow ! Anything else ? 
 What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? 

When will the ceremony begin ? 
 No idea . 

It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . 
 My best wishes to you and the bride ! 

Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country . 
 You don't want to join him ? 
 Yes , and I want to have a try . 
 I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . 
 Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . 
 I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . 
 I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . 
 If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . 
 No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . 
 Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid 
 Why do you ask ? 
 Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home . 
 Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . 
 Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . 

I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . 
 Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . 
 The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . 
 I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . 
 Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . 
 I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . 
 But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . 
 I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . 
 Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . 

Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . 
 But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? 
 What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? 

I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert . 
 Ordinary one , please . 
 I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 . 

Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? 
 But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? 
 Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . 

Do you have anything to do after this ? 
 Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? 
 I know a very interesting place . 

Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' ! 
 Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . 
 Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ? 
 I watched the screen display ! 
 It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA ! 

I hear you are moving to Dalian . 
 Well , we'll certainly miss you here . 
 Let's keep in touch . 

I just got a letter from an old high school buddy . 
 He usually keeps me posted . 
 It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . 

Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . 
 You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . 
 & you ? 
 Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . 
 OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . 
 Cute , like you . 
 Me too . Send you a kiss ... 

Do you have a bf ? 
 Why you say bf before ? 
 Have you got a new one ? 
 I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . 
 I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? 
 Wow ! Blablablabla . . . 
 I am flying like a bird . 
 I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . 
 It's OK , so I send you this . 
 It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . 
 Are you sleepy ? 
 Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . 
 C U here , honey . 
 I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . 
 I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . 
 I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . 
 Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . 
 Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . 
 Oh , about two years now . 
 They still live in Shanghai where I was born . 
 Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . 
 Wow , what a great burd ! 
 She's a real turn-on , alright ? 
 Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . 
 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . 
 Well , that's my opinion . 
 Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . 

Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? 
 Then let's go in . 
 I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . 
 Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? 
 What's he trying to pull anyway . 
 Maybe you should start seeing someone else . 

Did you enjoy that new movie ? 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 
 What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . 
 Doesn't sound promising . 
 If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . 

It is really exciting news . 
 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . 
 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . 

What are your plans for this weekend ? 
 If the weather's fine . 
 I know a good place to hire bikes if you want . 
 But remember , be careful when you ride a bike . The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous . 
 I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? 
 Right ! 
 Ok . 
 Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . 
 It sure looks special , looks expensive too . 
 Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered . 

Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ? 
 For suspicion of driving under influence . 

Hi , Mike , what gives ? 
 Hey , great set of wheels . 
 Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . 
 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 
 I can imagine . 
 I'd love to . 

What is your nationality ? 
 Where is your domicile place ? 

I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right 
 Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? 
 So many ? 
 Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? 

Where do you live now ? 
 Which street do you live on ? 

Where are you living ? 
 Do you move a lot ? 

How big is your family ? 
 Who supports the family ? 
 Do you live with your family ? 

Well , I am a regular member of this club . 
 Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars . 
 Very few , unfortunately . 
 Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies ! 
 Ten . How did your game go ? 
 Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . 
 Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . 
 We get alone very well . 
 At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . 
 Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . 
 No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . 
 Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you ! 
 Thank you ! The same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend's . And you ? 

Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? 
 They must be amazing animals . 
 I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . 

Judy , your husband has a really nice car . 
 Where are you going ? 
 I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? 
 I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? 
 Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . 
 Doesn't your mother live in the city ? 
 I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . 
 Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . 

I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday . It was very good . 
 We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun . 
 My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too . 

Will you help me take these things to the car ? 
 Bring them to my wife's car . 
 The blue SUV in front of the Honda . 
 That chair over there , but please be careful with it . It was a gift from my mother-in-law . 
 Let me help you with that . I don't want you to hurt your back . 
 Didn't I tell you ? We're moving to Florida ? 
 Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away . 
 My name is Sam . 
 I'm fine . Thank you . 
 I'm from England . 
 I'm a bank manager . 
 Thank you . 
 We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple . 
 The situation differs in person . 
 What does it say ? 
 Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . 
 I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . 
 Yes . Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six . 
 I can take a break at lunch time , but it is only 30 minutes . 
 Yes , I really don't like it . 
 Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ? 
 What's in it ? 
 A necklace ? 
 I have no idea . 
 Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you ! 

Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? 
 I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . 
 It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . 
 So you will come , won't you ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . 
 We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . 
 That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . 
 Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . 
 I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . 
 We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . 
 That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . 
 Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . 
 Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . 
 Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . 

Steven , I need badly your help . 
 My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary , and now she is going to divorce me . 
 Yes , I know I'm wrong . But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months . And I still love my wife . I couldn't live without her . 
 Yes , I swear . 
 Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ? 
 You are a real fan of extreme sports . 

Hi , happy new year ! 
 Time flies ! One year has already been a history ! 
 Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? 
 I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . 
 Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! 

Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? 
 That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? 
 Did you take any pictures ? 
 Sure , I love looking at photos . 
 Your daughter looks like her mother . 
 Where was this picture taken ? 
 Did you have time to go to the zoo ? 
 It looks like you all had a nice time . 

Hey ! I have a surprise for you . 
 Open this card and read . 

What are your weekend arrangements ? 
 What sort of things are you interested in ? 
 I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . 
 Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ? 
 Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself . 
 Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come . 
 Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . 
 Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . 

Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . 

I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . 

Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 . 
 Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . 
 Ha-ha , see you then . 
 I traveled the Three Gorges . 
 Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! 
 Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . 
 Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . 

Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . 
 I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . 
 But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . 
 No , I am the only child in my family . 
 Do they live with you and your parents ? 

I hate computer games . 
 Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . 
 If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . 

Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . 
 It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . 
 It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! 
 Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? 
 Oh my gosh , how exciting ! 
 Sure , I will . How can I miss that ? 
 Oh , don't . I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever ! 
 Of course . I can eat a horse now . 
 Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ? 

I think Bill Clinton is a good president . 
 Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . 
 Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . 

So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? 
 Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . 
 That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . 
 I would like to . but I'm not good at it . 
 That's great ! When will we go ? 
 All right . What should I take ? 
 Thanks . I will wait you at my home . 

Are you a soccer fan ? 
 Which team is your favorite ? 
 I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . 
 Not really ! 
 Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . 
 Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . 
 About David ? No , I didn ’ t hear anything . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . 
 Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to ! 
 Do you believe what they say ? 
 Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist . 
 Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . 
 I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . 
 Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . 
 A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player . 
 Maybe we all should learn something from him . 

Quite a few people are laid off these days . 
 University graduates have difficulty finding a job too . There seems to be more and more competition in the job market 
 No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one . 
 Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . 
 Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . 

Oh , what a beautiful garden ! 
 The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers . 
 You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden . 
 Yes . Thanks . 
 Does it work ? 
 Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . 

What's the matter with you ? You don't look well . 
 Really ? I like rainy days . The moisture in the air is good for my skin . 
 Me , too . At this time of the year , I often miss my home in the warm south . 
 Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ? 
 This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? 
 So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick . 
 It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . 
 It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . 
 But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . 
 Well , Thanksgiving is family event.So on Thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big Thanksgiving dinner . Kids will have lot of fun . 
 Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment . 
 For me ? The football games of course , I love football games . 
 Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . 
 You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . 
 Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . 
 Yes . I moved here last week . 
 I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you . 
 Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you . 
 OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful . 
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 

What a wonderful game ! 
 I think John is the best player on the field . 
 Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star . 
 Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful . 
 It ’ s a good idea . But I am afraid it ’ s too cold . It is very windy on the lake . 

Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . 
 Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ? 
 Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ? 

Hi , Mrs . Henderson . 
 Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? 
 No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? 
 Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . 

Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ? 
 Indeed , we got married too soon . 
 Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time . 
 We're happy together now . 
 Thank you ! 
 How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? 
 That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? 
 If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . 
 Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
 Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . 
 They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
 Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . 
 It's possible . 
 Thank you . I am very excited . 
 I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won . 
 It was really an exciting moment . 
 Why ? 
 Yes , do you always gather to welcome new comers ? 
 Really ? 

Just make yourself at home . 
 Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? 

You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . 
 What about some drink ? 

The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all . 
 Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious . 
 I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . 
 I went to Croydon . 
 No , I went for an interview . 
 Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee . 

Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . 
 I guess we'll see each other around . 
 You too . 
 Er ... no , go ahead . 
 Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang . 

I visited the Polar Aquarium today . 
 Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . 
 Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . 

When do children start school in your country ? 
 But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? 
 Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? 

Let me see . How much should I pay for you ? 
 No , this will not do . Let me see . 
 Good ideas . 
 I wouldn't say so . 
 Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . 
 So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ? 

Look , there are some words on the fish . 
 For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? 
 You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . 
 Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? 

John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? 
 Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . 
 Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 
 Okay , it sounds good . 
 Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! 
 For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . 
 No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . 
 Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . 
 It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! 
 Be careful of what you say , or you ’ ll have to eat humble pie . 

Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? 
 It must be hard being a father . 
 Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . 
 Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . 
 I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . 

Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 

I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 

The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . 
 Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . 
 I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . 

Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here . 
 All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? 

Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? 
 Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? 

Happy Birthday , Mary ! 
 Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . 
 I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . 
 Really ? It looks so nice . 
 All right . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . 
 No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . 

Cheer ! 
 So what time tomorrow ? 
 Where to meet ? 
 OK . Bottoms up . 
 It's on me . 

Adam , I'm sorry ! 
 Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . 
 Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . 
 Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . 

Could you tell me the right time , please ? 
 You'll have to get it fixed . 

What is the correct time , please ? 
 When will the lecture begin ? 

Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . 
 Ok . Goodbye . 

I just dropped in to say goodbye . 
 I'll leave at 10 o'clock . 
 Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? 
 OK . I'll be happy to join you . 
 Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch . 
 What's the hurry ? 
 You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there . 
 Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . 
 Quite good except thinking of you so much . 
 It's called love is blind , I think . 
 Not at all . 
 You're welcome at any time . 
 You're most welcome . 
 Call us as soon as you get home . 
 Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . 
 Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . 
 I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? 
 Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . 
 That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? 
 Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . 
 Kobe Bryant , of course . 
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 
 Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . 
 Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . 
 Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 
 Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . 
 I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . 
 No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . 
 OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . 
 It's very nice . I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? 
 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . 
 My pleasure . 
 That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . 
 You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . 
 You said it . 
 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . 
 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . 
 That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health . 
 But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! 
 I mean you couldn't give it up ! 
 How do you know ? 

You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? 
 How come ? 
 Why don't you phone her for a date again ? 
 Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . 

What are you using for bait today ? 
 Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . 

Mary and Tom are breaking up . 
 Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . 
 No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . 

Do you know who Ammo Hung is ? 
 You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? 
 In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show . 
 Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . 
 Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . 
 OK . Then tell me what else you know . 
 He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? 
 Indeed you know much about him . 

Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . 
 What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? 
 You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? 
 Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s 
 Mm . What came after that ? 
 Pretty good . Please continue . 
 The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . 
 Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . 
 Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . 
 Yeah . 
 Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . 
 I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . 
 Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . 
 I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . 
 We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . 
 He said that I put all other girls in the shade . 
 Well , he indeed likes me . 
 No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . 
 That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . 
 I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' 
 Yeah . 
 He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . 

Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? 
 Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . 
 A magic love potion ? 
 It can't be true . 
 So what am I going to do ? 
 That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? 

I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . 
 Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . 
 The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? 
 Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? 

Herman , why are you so excited ? 
 Have you fallen in love ? 
 Can you describe the situation at that time ? 
 What's her outlook ? 

Did you watch the Premiership last night ? 
 No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . 
 Which team do you back then ? 
 But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . 
 Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? 
 I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . 
 Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . 
 ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? 
 Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . 
 Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . 
 I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . 
 It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . 
 I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . 
 Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . 
 It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That's right.But I don't think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen . 
 Yes , twice . 
 No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . 
 Where ? 
 I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . 

Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . 
 why not ? I love animals and I love nature . 
 sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . 
 That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . 
 Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . 
 Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? 
 Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . 
 No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . 
 A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . 
 Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . 
 Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . 
 I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . 
 To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . 
 That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . 

Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . 
 Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good . 

I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . 
 To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . 

May I ask what the name is the girl ? 
 The tallest one . 
 Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ? 
 How do you think about her ? 
 I'm wondering if she has boyfriend . 
 Great ! Thank you very much . 
 Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . 
 The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . 
 Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . 
 Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . 
 Her name is Laura , isn't it ? 
 How old is she ? 
 What does she look like ? 
 Pretty , is she ? 

Can you lend me fifty bucks ? 
 I guess I don't earn enough . 
 That's my business , not yours . 
 So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? 
 I'm not disciplined enough I guess . 

Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? 
 You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . 
 It sounds like you weren't expecting that . 
 Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . 

What colour is her hair ? 
 What , curly ? 
 Does she wear glasses ? 
 No . I'm sure I know her . 
 Ah ... No , I can't place her . 
 Of course . I always keep what I catch . 
 If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it . 
 It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . 
 It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . 
 Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . 
 They sure are . They are practically jumping in the boat . 
 We're catching most of our fish with lures . 
 What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ? 
 Are you having any luck with the worms ? 
 That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ? 
 That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ? 
 We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there . 
 Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? 
 Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time . 
 Good luck . I hope you each some fish . 
 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
 Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . 
 Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . 

Are you still busy today ? 
 Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day . 
 Take care , honey . I am always expecting you . 
 Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . 
 Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? 
 I like to read Fortune . 
 Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . 
 But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . 

What's your favorite hobby ? 
 What kinds of books do you like to read ? 
 By the way , would you like to see movies ? 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 I just like to sleep like a lazy cat . 

They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us . 
 Of course they are . 
 Oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . That's all . 
 Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? 

Hello , Mr . Black , I'm calling to say goodbye . 
 I wish I could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home . 
 Yes , I did . 
 At 11:00 o'clock . 
 No , I'll go by myself , thanks . 

You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . 
 Do you have many friends ? 
 What do you usually do with them ? 

What do you usually do in your work time ? 
 Are you usually busy ? 
 What depends ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 There are three , my parents and I . 
 No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . 
 Yes , almost once a week . 
 Really ? 
 Sounds great . 
 How nice . 
 Good . 
 I booked a table yesterday . 
 Smith . 

I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 My surname is Gao . 

Would you like to stretch your legs ? 
 Let's get a soft drink . 
 It's a fifteen-minute intermission . 
 It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . 
 Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? 
 Do you have large concert halls in your city ? 
 That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . 
 Why do you listen to rap ? 
 Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . 
 I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . 
 I'd like to book a table tonight . 
 Eight . 
 Eight o'clock tonight , would you please set us in a private room ? 
 Maybe not , thank you all the same then . 
 Sure , what time ? 
 For how many people ? 
 Western food or Chinese food ? 
 Do you want an expensive meal ? 
 How much would you like to spend for each person ? 
 Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate . 
 OK . Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu ? 
 Anything you'd rather not have ? 
 How about drinks ? 
 Well . Dinner for ten at sixty Yuan a plate , drink's extra , at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening . Is that all right ? 
 My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening . 

Would you like to book a table , sir ? 
 Sure , when ? 
 For how many guests , please ? 
 How much would you like to spend ? 
 OK . 
 Eight . 
 Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . 

Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . 
 He seems to win awards everywhere . 
 I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' 

Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 We open at 6:30 , sir . 
 Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ? 
 Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Davis . 
 I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . 
 We'll try our best . 

Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . 
 Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . 
 That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . 
 Have you heard Maria Carey ? 
 Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . 
 Why ? 

What was the last movie you saw ? 
 Really ? I've seen that movie , too . 
 I thought it was pretty good . 
 You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding . 
 I guess it could happen . 
 Sounds good . What should we see ? 
 You mean the one starring John Travolta ? 
 Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday . 

Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . 
 Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . 
 Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . 
 Oh , really ? How does the book end ? 

I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ? 
 Why do you like old styles of dance ? 
 I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . 
 OK , I will.Thank you . 
 And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? 
 Then what are the Westerners fit for ? 
 Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? 
 I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . 
 Very interesting ! 
 How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . 
 I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll . 
 Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? 
 OK . Let's disco . 
 That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ? 
 All right . Let me get you something to drink . 
 With pleasure . 
 Me , what brought that on ? 
 What does it say ? 
 Like disco ? 
 And disco a kind of nightclub . 
 So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . 

How do you like this waltz ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 
 Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently . 
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you do best ? 
 Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 
 Fine . 
 It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . 
 Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . 
 You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . 

It's rather cold , isn't it ? 
 Shall I light the stove ? 
 Well , what's the climate like in your country ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 

How nice it is here . 
 I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . 

The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! 
 Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . 
 Autumn is also very nice in Washington . 
 No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . 
 Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? 
 I feel it's rather dry here . 
 Are you from the south ? 
 I see.so this is your hometown ? 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Not at all . 
 I'm glad . 

I'd better be going . 
 I wish I could , but it's already late . 
 Thank you for a wonderful meal . 

If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . 
 Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . 
 Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . 
 I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . 
 I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . 
 OK . I'll talk to you later . 
 Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? 
 Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . 

It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . 
 I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . 

How do you usually sell your products now ? 
 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? 
 What advantages does it have ? 
 Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 
 Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ? 
 You mean there may be credit problems ? 
 Will you give some suggestion ? 
 Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . 
 You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . 
 You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . 
 At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . 
 The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . 

Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? 
 I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . 
 Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? 
 Is the service charged ? 
 Really . I'll get a computer at once . 
 That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 

Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . 
 One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . 
 If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . 

I'm better now . Want to play again ? 
 Let's get all the balls out of the pockets . 
 You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles . 
 All my relatives are getting together at my house . 
 Who can't make it in your family ? 
 That's too bad . So , what did you ask for Christmas this year ? 
 I want some computer games also . I gave my parents a really long Christmas list . 
 So what does your family do on Christmas Day ? 
 Our family is a little different . We go to church on Christmas Eve instead . 
 Almost . I have to get dressed . It's a formal party and I have special party make up ! 
 Great ! Uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . We all have to bring a gift . 
 ( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents ! 
 Wow ! It's just what I wanted ! 

Did you get a nice tree ? 
 Let's put it over there . 
 Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations . 
 There , ... we're about done . 
 OK . Here goes . 

We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ? 
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . 

These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . 
 That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . 

Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ? 
 How come ? 
 Don't you like games 
 Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . 
 I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . 

Hi ! I'm happy you could make it . 
 What can I get you ? 

Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . 
 What would you like to drink ? 

Come in . It's nice to see you again . 
 Would you care for a drink ? 

We are doing ' Secret Santa ' at the office again this year . 
 I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . 
 Sure . 
 BBS means Bulletin Board Service . 
 A lot of things ! 
 Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . 
 Why not ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . 
 ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' 
 Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . 
 Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . 
 Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . 
 No . Why ? 
 No way ! 

what are you doing ? 
 you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? 
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! 
 Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . 
 My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . 
 Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? 
 Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? 
 How about mah-jong ? 
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! 

What did you do last night ? 
 Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? 
 What were the results of the game ? 
 What was the actual score ? 
 Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . 
 What happened ? 
 That explains it . 
 That was the last game before the playoffs . 
 In a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? 
 Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . 
 Ok , it's a date then ! 
 No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . 
 They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . 
 I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . 
 I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . 
 Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . 
 People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
 That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . 
 Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . 
 Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
 If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . 
 He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
 They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
 I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
 I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . 

Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! 
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! 
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . 
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . 
 We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . 
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . 
 Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . 
 Today is December 23,2002 . 
 Merry Christmas to you ! 
 I don't think so . 
 That suits me fine . 
 Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . 
 Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . 
 Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . 
 He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . 
 I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . 
 You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . 

Hey , what's up ? 
 What were you writing ? 
 You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! 
 But , you work with her everyday . 
 You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? 
 Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . 
 I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . 
 Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? 
 Have a great time tomorrow night . 

Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ? 
 Hi , Mary . This is Tom . 
 Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? 
 Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? 
 Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . 

Does your girl friend like swimming ? 
 Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke . 
 Really ? Then just ask her to follow me . 
 Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing . 
 To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . 

So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? 
 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . 
 Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . 
 That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 
 Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 
 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 
 Why not ? 
 That sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . 
 Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . 
 I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . 
 Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! 
 Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . 
 Maybe some other time . 
 Fine , just fine . Thanks . 
 Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . 
 The same to you ! 
 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 

Have a nice weekend ! 
 Do you have any plans ? 
 Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . 
 Yes , of course . It was nice to see you . 

Bob ! 
 Fine , just fine . And you ? 
 Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . 
 Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation . 
 Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . 
 I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . 
 Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . 
 Fine , they are colorful and tasty . 
 Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . 
 No , thanks . I'm full . 
 No , thanks . I'm on diet . 
 Ice cream , please . 
 Thanks ! We love it . 
 I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! 
 Probably nothing . 
 Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means . 
 Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . 
 Not much . 
 That sounds good . 
 Candlelight in the Window 
 I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . 
 No . I heard that's really boring . 
 Great idea ! 
 Thanks , I'm enough . 
 I'll have it if you insist . 
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! 
 I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . 
 No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well . 
 You just said 10 rounds . 
 Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this . 

You keep bowling spares but no strike . 
 I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . 
 The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . 

Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 It wasn't cold out this morning . 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . 
 Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . 
 I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . 
 I am 24 . 
 I was born on April 15 , 1986 . 
 I was born in Beijing in 1965 . 
 Really ? Thank you . 
 You're really sporty ! 
 Do you have clubs ? 
 There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . 
 Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . 
 Okay . 
 What do you do with it ? 
 Okay . 
 OK . 
 Hey ! 
 Got it . 
 My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . 
 Yes , I am a local resident . 
 How about going to the theatre ? 
 Well , what do you like doing ? 
 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . 
 Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow . 

Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my schoolmates . 
 Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday . 
 Yeah . 
 China . 
 China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . 

Do you like traveling ? 
 Where did you visit ? 
 How did you like it ? 
 Why did you go there ? 
 And do you have friends there ? 
 You must have enjoyed yourself . 

So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? 
 And , is it what you found ? 
 You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . 
 Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . 
 Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . 
 Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . 
 I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . 

How do you like skiing , Pat ? 
 I suppose skiing is easy for you . 
 I see . Do you ski often ? 
 That sounds great . 
 Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg 

Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? 
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 
 That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . 
 Ok , good luck to you . 
 I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . 
 Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . 
 Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? 
 All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . 
 Yes , I am . What's up ? 
 With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . 
 But I am told that you dance wonderfully well . 
 No . Just occasionally . 
 It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz . 
 To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy . 
 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well . 
 OK . 

Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? 
 Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . 
 The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . 
 Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? 
 Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night . 
 I hope he can come later . 
 How do we get to the library from here ? 

David , what have you been up to lately ? 
 Really ? Where did you go ? 
 What cities did you go to ? 
 Did you go to Berlin ? 
 I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . 
 I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . 

Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . 
 And do you really love her ? 

How do you think should I handle this problem ? 
 But I'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss . 
 She's always bothering me . What should I do ? 
 But she always harps on me . 
 Yes , great ! 
 Oh , never mind . I am just going to do the laundry today . 
 It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway . 
 It's 8 sharp by my watch . 

By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? 
 And the date , please . 

It looks like it's going to be sunny . 
 They say we're going to get some rain later . 

What time do you have ? 
 I must be off now . I'm pressed for time . 

But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . 
 I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . 

Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . 
 I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . 
 OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good-bye . 
 To be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! 
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
 Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . 
 That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 
 What should I bring with me ? 
 I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . 
 I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? 
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 
 Ok , where and when should I meet you ? 

Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ? 
 That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good . 
 But why do you choose cycling at first ? 
 You are really a good citizen . 

Julia , will you be my wife ? 
 Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you . 
 Julia , I really love you . I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future . 
 So , will you marry me ? 

I know you have a son . How old is he ? 
 Who is looking after him ? 
 You really are lucky ! 

Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? 
 When is it convenient for you ? 
 Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ? 
 Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . 
 OK . Bye ! 
 I'd love to . Thanks . 
 Any time will suit me . 
 I'm free tomorrow . 
 All right , see you then . 
 When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 
 That's right . Why do you ask ? 
 When are getting married ? 
 Congratulations ! I had no idea . 
 Do you like amusement parks ? 
 If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . 
 Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . 
 I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
 Next Wednesday . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Ten days ago . 
 Yes , he will . 

Good morning , Paul ! 
 Yes , traffic wasn't much today , so I made it to the office earlier . 
 Well , about an hour or so . 
 No . I take public transportation . It's safer . 
 Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . 
 Certainly . 
 Come by any time . 
 Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . 
 Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening . 
 I'd like to , where ? 
 When ? 
 I'll go in time , thank you . 

Wow , is that your sports car ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 When's the last time you had it serviced ? 
 I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . 
 What else is wrong with it ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Why don't you get it all fixed ? 
 Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! 
 I had to look after my son at home . 
 He has a fever . 
 I think so.Thank you . 
 And I must thank you again for your generous help . 
 I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards . 
 A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . 
 Yes , I do like him . 
 You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . 
 Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . 
 So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . 
 They're my family 
 Yes , I'm the third child . 
 Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother . 
 Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again . 
 Thanks again for everything you have done for me . 

I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? 
 Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? 
 If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . 

Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? 
 Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? 
 Do you believe her excuse ? 
 Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . 

Are you working or are you a student ? 
 Which school are you studying at ? 

Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . 
 Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . 
 I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . 
 It's time I left . 

Do you live with your parents ? 
 How often do you go back to visit them ? 

Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ? 
 Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else . 
 I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed . 

May I invite you to dance with me ? 
 Never mind , I can teach you . 
 No , it is easy . 
 You just follow me . 
 Yup , because dance can relax myself . 

Hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight ! 
 Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ? 

How will you spend this lovely weekend ? 
 We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ? 
 Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win . 
 See you tomorrow . 

Harry is a hen-pecked husband . 
 Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? 

I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? 
 You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . 

Have you enjoyed your weekend ? 
 Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . 
 This Friday evening ? 
 Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go . 
 What time should I arrive ? 
 Fine . See you then . 
 Only once or twice at the most . 
 I have no idea . 
 Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . 
 But how can I prevent a deficit ? 
 OK , OK . I ’ ll do my best . 
 I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through . 

I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue . 
 She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . 
 Sort of yes . 
 But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . 
 Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? 
 That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . 
 Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 
 I'll think about it . 
 Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? 
 Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . 
 Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? 
 Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? 

Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? 
 It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . 
 Is classical music your favorite ? 
 I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it . 
 Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . 
 I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . 
 oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . 

Well , how was your honeymoon ? 
 Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! 
 My friends and I just got back from Bali . 
 Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . 
 I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! 
 I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . 
 We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? 
 Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? 
 It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . 
 It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us . 
 Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents . 
 You need a child first , and that's your duty , too . 

Hello . 
 How are you ? 
 Good . Do you speak English ? 
 Yes . 
 I'm from California . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 I'd like that very much . 
 Fine . See you later . 
 I'd enjoy that . 
 OK . I'll see you then . 
 My name is Jessica . What's yours ? 
 You speak English very well . 
 Do you know what time it is ? 
 What did you say ? 
 Thanks . 

Would you like to go to a party tonight ? 
 Would 7:00 be OK ? 

Hi Sarah , how are you ? 
 OK . 
 I'm hungry . I'd like to eat something . 
 I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant . 
 I like spaghetti . Do you like spaghetti ? 

Do you know that song ? 
 The song you hear now . 
 Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ? 
 Good idea . 
 I'd love to . 
 That's OK with me . 
 Yeah . Why not ? 
 Oh , you went to the wedding ? 
 I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time . 
 It's Thursday , I think . 
 We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . 

I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . 
 But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . 
 That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . 
 That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . 
 I don't know . Who ? 
 The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? 
 So you're a big fan , eh ? 
 And she was in a movie once again , right ? 
 What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? 
 Did you take a photo with her ? 
 Crazy ! 
 Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn . 
 I know what you mean . I ’ m not only after bucks . There ’ s something more in life . 
 Maybe they are still wet behind ears . 
 Sure . Many people , including men and women , and be easily ripped off . 
 No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . 
 I ’ m down in spirits . 
 My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . 
 I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . 
 But I doubt myself . 

We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? 
 Oh , come on ! Just a quick one ! 

Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ? 
 Which day would suit you ? 
 How about Thursday ? 
 Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ? 
 See you on Thursday , then . 
 A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ? 
 I don't know . I never went to one . 
 Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Very sorry , I am occupied tonight . What about tomorrow night ? 
 7:00 in my staying hotel . 

Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered . 
 Really ? I hope to meet him soon . 
 I'd love to . 
 That's OK with me . 
 Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? 
 Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . 
 I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . 
 I love this art exhibition ! 
 OK . 
 I'd like that very much . 
 Fine . See you later . 
 Is there anything good playing ? 
 Really ? I want to go , too . 
 No problem . 
 I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie . 
 But their love is touching ! 
 I am not ! 
 He's still pretty sick . 
 We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . 
 Thanks a lot . I'll tell him . 
 Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help . 
 Sure . 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 
 Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . 
 Hi . 
 I'm not sure yet . 
 Yes . When ? 
 Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? 
 Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? 
 OK . Where ? 
 Oh , Where is that ? 
 OK , I'll meet you there . 
 How can you be so sure ? You haven ’ t been together with her , have you ? 
 Then try it yourself . 
 As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . 
 Tell him I hope he's better soon . 

Hello , Mary . Nice day , isn't it ? 
 I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time . 
 OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right . 
 Ah , you changed so fast . 
 He's a little sick under the weather . 
 He has the flu . 
 I will . 
 It's about 5 degrees centigrade . 
 The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow . 
 I think I'll soon get used to it . 
 lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter . 
 I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice . 
 He's been out of work for a couple of days . 
 He has a bad cold . 
 Thanks . I'll tell him . 
 Hi , Nice to meet you . 
 Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ? 
 Oh . Where do you work ? 
 I'm a teacher . 
 I teach English . 
 At a high school in New Jersey . 
 I'm 32 . 
 Don't worry about it . 
 No . Don't be silly . I wouldn't dream of letting you do that . 
 It's such a nice change . 
 Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again . 
 Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all . 
 As long as it doesn't snow ! 
 It's hot . 
 Let's just hope it doesn't get hotter . 
 It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . 
 Well , the worst of the winter should be over . 
 Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? 
 Sorry , I can't go today . 
 Ok . What time ? 
 I think that's too late . 
 Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? 
 Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . 
 OK , I like that place . 
 Poor fellow ! What's the date today , buddy ? 
 You forgot all about it , didn't you ? 
 It's supposed to rain . 
 Well , it won't last long . 
 It's fine today . 
 It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . 
 It's going to be sunny tomorrow . 
 Thursday . 
 I'd love to . 
 Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ? 

What's the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 Is your watch right ? 

David , would you like something to eat ? 
 Do you want something to drink ? 
 Sorry , I don't have any coffee . 
 A small glass , or a big one ? 
 Here you are . 
 You're welcome . 
 It's 5:30 by my watch . 
 Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . 
 I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . 
 Let's ask someone else . 
 OK . When ? 
 10 in the morning ? 
 Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM . 
 No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then . 
 That's fine . 
 Alright . Bye . 
 I'm afraid it gains a little . 
 Two . 
 That's Susan . 
 She's a lawyer . 
 No , but she speaks English fluently . 
 Yes , I know her . We're friends . 
 Which man ? 
 Oh , that's Matt . 
 Yeah . 
 I don't know him , but I think my sister does . 
 Yes , he's married . 

Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 Oh ! I hate rainy days ! 
 Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . 
 Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? 

Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . 
 No , but the table cloth was dirty . 
 I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . 
 I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . 

John , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ? 
 I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk . 
 I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day . 
 Thanks , I will . 
 I stayed up last night . 
 Will , I'm under a lot of pressure . My manager is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . 
 Oh , buddy , you are so kind . Thank you ! 

I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . 
 I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . 

What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? 
 That's really interesting . 
 Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . 

Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? 
 Do you drink green tea , then ? 
 But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . 
 Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . 
 Why is it so ? 

Brian , do you know how to speak English ? 
 Where did you learn ? 
 You speak really well . 
 How long have you been in the U . S . ? 
 Is your wife with you ? 
 Have you been to California before ? 
 Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? 

I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping . 
 If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . 

Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? 
 That's great . We can go to the bank together . 
 I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . 
 Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . 
 Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . 
 No . It is free of charge . 
 I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . 
 Not good . I lost my wallet . 
 No , I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi . 
 Can I borrow some money ? 
 About 50 dollars . 
 Thanks . I'll pay you back on Friday . 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 If you wait a minute I can go with you . 

Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? 
 We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . 
 I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . 
 Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . 
 Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . 
 Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? 
 I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . 
 No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . 
 I'll see you there at 9pm . 

You seem to be very tired . 
 Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? 

We seem to be lost here . 
 I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman . 

Steven , why are you so depressed ? 
 What's the news ? 
 It's horrible . 
 Yes . How about donating some money ? 
 Just find the answer through Internet . 

Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? 
 You look so upset . What's going on ? 
 Oh , what a pity ! 
 Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . 
 Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed . 
 I understand . 
 I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . 
 I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? 
 I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you . Shall we find some other time ? 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . 
 Yeah , you are right . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . 

Did you see the fashion awards last night ? 
 Not interested ? 
 But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . 
 Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? 
 Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . 
 They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . 
 That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . 
 Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . 
 That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . 
 Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . 
 Yes , maybe I should have another try . 
 No , I only know four great beauties of China . 
 Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? 
 Then who were they ? 
 It seems that the inner beauty is also important . 

Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? 
 Oh , When does it close ? 
 That's too bad . 
 Alright . What do you want to do now ? 
 Where does she live ? 
 How long has she lived there ? 
 That's a long time . Where did she live before that ? 

You look tired . Did you sleep well last night ? 
 Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health . 
 Yes . 
 I have two kids . A boy and a girl . 
 Jack and Stephanie . 
 Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . 
 Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . 
 She studies English . 
 No , she's at school . 
 I'm not . 
 I trust you . 
 I'm fling , Jack . ( singing ) Come , Josephine , in my flying machine . Up she goes , and up she goes ... 
 Yes , but I don't know much about it . 
 My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma . 

Can you believe me ? 
 Please count on my love . 
 I'll be yours through endless time . 
 Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry . 
 My love will grow , like a river to flow . 
 I don't know whether we are in a dream . 

What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . 
 It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . 

We'd like a half-day package . 
 How many can we choose ? 
 We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . 

That was heaven ! 
 Really ? 
 Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! 
 Yes , why ? 
 Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Aha , someone has a crush on Anny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! 
 Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! 
 Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . 
 I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? 

Flowers for my favorite girl . 
 That's a secret . Here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way . 
 Fine , what do you call this ? 
 Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you . 

Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do . 
 Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final . 
 Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time . 
 OK . 
 You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? 
 Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! 
 He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! 
 Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . 
 Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . 
 I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! 
 So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . 
 You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . 
 Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . 
 Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . 
 In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . 
 Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . 
 They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . 
 Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . 
 Yes , she is my favorite girl . I've decided to go steady with her . 
 Sure . She is the ideal girl , the one I had dreamed of . 
 She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her . 

It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . 
 Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . 
 Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . 
 I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . 
 I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . 
 Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . 
 Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . 
 I went shopping . 
 Yes , I bought a few things . 
 I bought this coat . Do you like it ? 
 At the mall on 5th street . 
 No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . 
 I know . It was a really good deal . 

Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ? 
 I have tickets to a show . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Pop . It's Maria Carey . 
 At 8P M tomorrow night . 
 Yes , that's a good idea . 
 Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ? 

When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ? 
 Well ... How about Friday then ? 
 Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ? 
 That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . 

Come on , you must tell me everything about him . 
 Hmm ... 
 Oh , how long ? 
 OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . 
 Really ? 
 Fine . 

I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? 
 I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! 
 Are you serious , John ? 

Can we sit on the grass , darling ? 
 Look , darling ! I can see a bench near that tree . 
 It's not raining , darling . The bench isn't wet . 
 Yes , I can . 
 It says ' Wet paint ! ' 
 No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do . 
 My father lives in Washington DC . 
 My mother died two years ago . 
 No , he's retired . 
 Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . 
 Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston . 
 Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas . 
 Just the two of you ? 
 Where did you go ? 
 True ? The food is terrible . 
 Really ? 
 Hey , Julie . How's it going ? 
 Who were you talking to ? 
 You look so happy . I see a twinkle in your eyes . 
 Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes ! 
 Well , that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him . 

He said he will get married by the end of this month . 
 Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . 
 Say it ! What is it ? 
 You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . 
 Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . 
 Stop it . No more of that talk . 
 No , I shall faint . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . 
 That would be great . 
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . 
 Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . 
 You're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? 
 I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! 
 You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . 
 That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! 

Hello , Tom ! 
 How are you doing ? 
 I'm just a little tired . 
 I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . 
 Pretty fine , thanks . 
 I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now . 
 See you . 
 It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! 
 Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 
 That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
 Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . 
 No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! 
 We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . 
 Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 

How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? 
 I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . 
 Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . 
 Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it . 
 OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , he was 29 then . 

Is this your brother-in-law ? 
 From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . 

Lee , I'm going to get married next month . 
 You are invited to my wedding . 

What kind of sport do you often do ? 
 I used to swim a lot , but now I'm taking gym classes . 

What is life ? 
 Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us . 
 Right . 
 That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . 
 Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . 
 Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . 

so nice to see you again , Louise . How are you doing ? 
 Not too bad . 
 Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you . 
 Where are you from ? 
 I'm from Chicago . 
 I'm moblogging ! 
 Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . 
 Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . 
 Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . 
 Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . 
 You bet it ! 
 That depends . What does she look like ? 
 How tall is she ? 
 Is she chubby ? 
 It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? 
 How's her skin ? 
 Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? 
 What's the tattoo on her foot like ? 
 Even her mother ? 
 What's her personality like ? 
 So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! 
 How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . 
 You really have keen eyes . 
 Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? 
 I'll finish soon . 
 I do wish I could afford one . 
 Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? 
 Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet . 
 It must be very convenient and pretty quick . 

Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . 
 Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . 
 That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . 

Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? 
 I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . 
 Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . 
 But it's really exciting . 
 Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . 
 I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . 

Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? 
 Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . 
 Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . 
 Yes , thank you . I ’ Ve already been helping myself . 
 I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine . 
 I'II have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me . 
 Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back soon . 
 I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back . 
 I was in New York for a wedding . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . 
 No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . 
 Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . 
 He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? 
 So what ? 

Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! 
 Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . 

Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I'll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . 
 Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . 

Come and sit down . Would you like a drink ? 
 Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ? 
 Do you like it ? It's Irish music . 
 Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall . Have you been there ? 
 Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ? 

Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ? 
 The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you . 
 Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all . 
 Why ? 
 Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love . 
 I'm fine thanks . How about you ? 
 Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks . 
 Probably in a week or two . I'll let you know . 
 I've been really busy . How is everything ? 
 Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 
 No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ? 
 What about the next day ? 
 Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant . 
 That's fine . See you there ! 
 Fortunately , there is no person died . 
 Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . 
 Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . 
 Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . 
 Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . 

What a pin-up she is ! 
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 

Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Late night ? 

Hey , what's the matter ? 
 Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 

I don't think I'm getting better . 
 I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 Yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . 
 Can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . 
 Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . 
 Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . 
 Then , you're probably addicted . 
 How do you pay for it ? 
 Tell me if you need help . 
 I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . 
 OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . 
 Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . 
 That sounds fine . 
 Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . 
 Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . 
 Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? 
 Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? 
 Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? 
 Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information 
 Sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . 
 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . 
 At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . 
 It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . 
 Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . 

Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here ! 
 How's life going , Zhang Lin ? 
 Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle . 
 Good bye . 
 No , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . 
 We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . 
 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
 I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
 You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . 
 I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . 
 I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . 
 I went to a movie with my boyfriend . 
 It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . 
 Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . 
 The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . 
 It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . 
 Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . 
 Yeah . To win is the most important thing . 
 How come ? 
 He's such a mother hen . 
 I don't know . Maybe a pair of new shoes . 
 That's a dandy idea . Thank you for reminding me . 
 I don't know , what's wrong ? 
 Maybe you should ask him openly . 
 Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ? 
 Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time . 

Is this a photo of your family ? 
 You look so lovely . 

I don't know about you , but I am famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? 
 I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot . 
 Sure . If I could , I would eat hot pot every day ! 
 Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner ! 
 Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? 
 Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? 
 You really have a big head , don't you . 
 My what ? Oh , that , right as a trivet . 
 I will , thank you . 
 Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you . 
 Just call me Miao Dou , Please . 
 My mother works in a company as an accountant . 
 Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . 
 OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep . 

Hello , my name is Xu Hua . I'm from Beijing . 
 Welcome to China , Paula . 

Hello , I'm Lance . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 See you . Have a nice day ! 

Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? 
 She looks very healthy.How old is she ? 

Nice day , isn't it ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Nice meeting you , Kevin . I hope to see you again . 
 Sure , let's . Goodbye , then . 
 I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? 
 What is the rate ? 
 How about mileage and gas ? 
 OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . 
 Here you are . 
 My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . 
 No , usually they're very busy . 
 He looks strong.What does he do ? 
 He must be very brave . 

What a brilliant smile ! 
 He must be very easy-going . 

Your father looks much younger in the picture . 
 How old is he now ? 

What shall I call him ? 
 What's he doing ? 

I heard many stories about your brother . 
 What does he look like ? Is he handsome ? 

Sorry to interrupt . Can I have a word with you ? 

After you . 
 That's very kind of you . 
 I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late . 
 I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me . 
 You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . 
 Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ? 

Steven , have you any friend in London ? 
 Are you close ? 
 I'm going to London on business next week . But I know nothing about it . 
 Yes , Steven . You always know what I want . 
 Thank you ! 
 Thank you . You're very kind . 
 What's up ? 
 Are you asking me for a date ? 
 I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there . 
 Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there . 
 How about seven ? 

Mr.Martin , we're on arrival . 
 We'll miss you . I hope we'll keep in touch . 
 It's my pleasure . We hope you'll visit Beijing again . 
 It's almost time to get aboard . 
 Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey ! 
 Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
 That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 
 If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? 
 You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . 
 The Taj it is then . 
 They'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
 Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . 
 No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . 

What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? 
 How about going to the suburbs ? 

Mum , this is for you . 
 Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! 

Happy New Year , Jim ! 
 Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family . 

Merry Christmas , Linda ! 
 Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it . 

Hi , where have you been ? 
 Oh , how was it ? 

Victoria , you are back from vacation ! How was it ? 
 How come ? 

Good to see you . Come on in . 
 Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much . 
 I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . 
 Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . 
 Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? 
 Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . 
 I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . 
 Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . 
 Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? 
 Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! 
 Autumn . Autumn is the best season in Beijing . 

Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . 
 No , he's living in an old house in Warton . 
 That's the one . 
 He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . 
 No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . 
 He still has a complaint though . 
 He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . 
 You can say that again . 
 Um , very nice . It's warm in spring and cool in autumn . 
 Yes , it is , but not as hot as in Beijing . 
 You can never do that . 
 There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . 
 Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . 
 You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . 

Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll . 
 Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things . 

Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . 
 Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . 
 No wonder people say 
 I didn't know you liked bird-watching . 

I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding . 
 Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement . 

What a beautiful view . 
 What is that below ? 
 No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me . 
 Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . 
 That's true . 
 All right . ... What's the date today , please ? 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents . 
 We ’ re identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else . 
 We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father . 
 What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? 
 Sounds like it was meant to be . 
 My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ? 
 For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share . 
 No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ? 
 That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! 
 I don ’ t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! 
 Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! 
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! 
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! 
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . 
 I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . 
 I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . 

What are you doing tonight ? 
 Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? 
 What store do you shop at ? 
 I have been using the store across town for years . 
 They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . 
 I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . 
 It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home . 
 How did you know ? 
 His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there . 
 Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . 
 Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . 
 Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated . 
 Well , I ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . We don ’ t know what will happen . 
 Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . 
 You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . 
 I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . 
 Not at all . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . 
 That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! 
 My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
 Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . 
 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . 
 My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . 
 We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
 Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
 Winning is a piece of cake to me . 

What are you doing now , Steven ? 
 Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . 
 No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . 
 Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing . 
 No thanks . 
 Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . 
 Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . 
 Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . 
 Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . 

Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? 
 Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . 
 Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 
 Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 
 Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . 
 It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . 
 The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . 
 Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head 
 He's always confused by easy questions . 
 No . what's it like ? 
 Would you want to live there ? 
 What's your dreamhole like then ? 
 Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? 
 Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ? 
 I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? 

This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty . 
 Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way . 

I like your sweater . It suits you very well . 
 She certainly has the taste . 
 Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him . 

Good morning , Kevin . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too . 
 Nothing special . 
 That's great . I would love to . And when ? 
 No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner . 
 All right , see you tonight . 

You have a nice apartment . 
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 

Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ? 
 It's nice of you to say so . 
 Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 That ’ s great . I'd love to . 
 Oh ! I forgot all about it . Of course you can have it back , John . I'm sorry about the delay . 

Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? 
 Till the end of the week . 

Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy . 
 Oh , congratulations ! 
 I want to travel . 
 The seaside . 
 I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . 
 Thank you ! 
 Ok , you name the day . 
 What day is that ? 
 Good . Where shall we meet ? 
 Yes . I think I'm lucky . 
 Thank you for saying that . 
 Sounds good . When and where shall we meet ? 
 Fine , see you then . 
 I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you . 
 Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me ? 
 Of course , I will.Well , it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit . 
 Goodbye ! 
 Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . 
 But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . 
 Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? 
 Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? 
 Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . 
 If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . 

What's your favorite sport ? 

What are the good sights to see in Beijing ? 

What's the most popular sport in your country ? 
 Do you play table tennis ? 

Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . 
 That must be very beautiful . 
 Really ? Have you ever been there ? 
 Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . 

Hello , Hanson . Today I come to say goodbye to you , for I'm going back to London tomorrow . 
 Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t . I've already booked the flight . 
 Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance . 
 I will miss you , too . You're really a good friend . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 I will . 
 Thankyou . Goodbye ! 
 Fishing . It's great fun . 
 No wonder you always look so active . 
 Sports . 
 Basketball and swimming . 
 Good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? 
 That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . 
 What's that ? 
 That's annoying , but nothing to worry about . 
 Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 Is there anything else bothering you ? 
 Do you have any other plans this weekend ? 
 Try not to take on more than you can handle . 

Steven , have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ? 
 What's the way you keep in contact ? 
 Email is not always the best form . I think QQ is way better . 
 You're right . 
 I listen to music and read . 
 I think I like classical music better . 

I like small towns . 
 Not always , and there're also few cars ! 

Hello . Can I sit here ? 
 By the way , I'm Robin . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I'm from Kathmandu . What about you ? 
 Bye . See you . 
 That means it's developing very fast . 
 Problems are inevitable . 
 Oh , yes . I really like it here . 
 Sure . I'd love to . 
 Yes . I've already been to several clubs here . 
 Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week . 
 Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time . 
 Great ! Let's make a reservation . 
 He would get very angry if anyone criticized him . 
 If only he knew it . 
 Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday . 
 We drove to the lake and had a picnic . We had a great time ! How about you ? Did you do anything special ? 
 That old thing ! Why don't you just buy a new one ? 

Ashley , what a great dinner party ! 
 Just water would be fine . 
 Yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! 
 Sure , I love salad ! 
 Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! 

Where do you live , Kim ? 
 Oh , that's convenient , but ... how much crime is there ? 
 . I have a house in the suburbs . 
 No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble . 
 OK . Great idea ! 
 Oh , it's really a drag . 
 Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! 
 I heard it has been finally settled under the rose . 
 Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . 
 Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me . 
 It is so kind of you , Dad . 
 She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . 
 Don't worry . She will be all right . 
 No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 . 
 I was seventeen . 
 No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for two years first . 
 Thanks . Your English is pretty good , too . 

So , did you go out with Richard ? 
 Did you like it ? 
 Yeah . So did you do anything else ? 
 Did you have fun there ? 

His grandfather is the richest person in the area . 
 His grandfather's money is not his . 

You don't look very well . 
 Is it because of the bad weather ? It's been really miserable for the past tew days . 
 Not really , but I've got used to it now . 
 Not quite good . It's windy and dry . We have got continental climate there . It's dry all the year round . Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York . 
 No , it isn't very cold at that time . You'll only need some light wool clothing with somejackets and shirts . 
 That's why he's very popular among girls . 
 You are ! 
 What ? No kidding ! 
 I can't believe it ! 
 Does he like that country ? 
 Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ? 
 Yes , he once gave her seven roses . 
 No way to know . 
 Thank you very much for your kindness . 
 No , he left nothing . 
 He must be an experienced accountant . 
 Great minds think alike . 
 I don't know if anything terrible has happened . 
 We'd better prepare for the worst . 
 I feel the same way . 
 It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . 
 Poor man , he must be terribly fed up with it . 
 Oh , Really ? 
 I'm most upset to hear that.Are you better now ? 

You must be feeling terrible for Mary . 
 I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class . 

Sorry , sir . I came late because I had to send for the doctor for my grandfather . 
 Thank you , sir . 

Bob is getting on in years . 
 He looks tired all the time . 

Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 
 I only paid two dollars for mine . 
 Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! 
 No , I couldn't care less ! 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 

Can you study with the radio on ? 
 What is the difference ? 
 That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . 
 What's he like ? 
 You must feel very uneasy at his home . 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? 
 I can tell it from your build . 
 Oh , it has nothing to do with me . 
 I came here only a month ago . 
 Em , it's delicious ! 
 You're lucky . 
 How old is he ? 

You missed the film.That ' s a shame . 
 Yes . I got very excited . 

My friend Jean is very beautiful . 
 Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . 
 Dark blue . 
 He prefers suits to jackets . 
 As a matter of fact , he is . 
 Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . 

What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 

I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . 
 Why ? 

Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? 
 What ? That's too much . 
 Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . 
 Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . 

Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? 
 That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? 
 Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . 
 It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . 
 So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . 

A new film is on . Have you ever seen it ? 
 It's a feature film . 

The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . 
 I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . 

What do you know about Julia Roberts ? 
 I mean her personality . 

I'll always remember my college days . 
 It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . 
 It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . 
 I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . 
 I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 How could it be ? 
 You didn't have an offer ? 
 I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! 
 Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . 
 Yes , but I don't like the story . 
 That of the old man . 
 Some of the scenes moved me into tears . 
 Sure . Which button do I press to shoot ? 
 Do I have to focus it ? 
 All right . Say cheese ! 
 Yes , dad , it was . 
 It was long , too . 
 But it went by fast . It was interesting . 
 I'll give you a speech like that , too . 
 Of course . 
 You have lots of friends . They will be there , too ! 
 Really ? How many do you have ? 
 That is a lot of friends . Do you have a best friend ? 
 How many best friends do you have ? 
 Hmm . I have only one best friend . 
 I have only a few friends . 
 That's very nice of you . 
 It's bulldog 123 . 
 Yes . 
 What do you mean ? 
 456 Cherry Drive , Pasadena , CA 91170 . 
 So what's the problem ? 
 Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com . 
 Me too . 
 I meet too many jerks . 
 This city is full of jerks . 
 But what can you do ? 
 And they will yell back at you . 
 No . The best thing to do is just stay home . 
 Who wrote it ? 
 Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ? 

What's the weather like ? 
 Why don't you look outside ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Is it raining right now ? 
 How do you know ? 
 I have to go shopping today . 

Don't you ever cheat on me . 
 Because men like to cheat . 
 I'm watching you . 
 If I catch you , you'll be sorry . 
 I will poke your eyes out . 
 I will chop your toes off , one by one . 

Tell me why you saw the movie twice . 
 You bet it . 
 I'm fine . How about yourself ? 
 No problem . So how have you been ? 
 I've been good . I'm in school right now . 
 I go to PCC . 
 It's okay . It's a really big campus . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . 
 Yes , my wife is coming to get me . 
 No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? 
 Do you have a car ? 
 You're lucky ! 
 Katherine ? Well , she's good at languages . 
 She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese . 
 And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball . 
 But there's one thing she's not good at . 
 She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! 
 Well , my whole family is in the United States now , but we're from Costa Rica originally . 
 Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America . 

Hi , Victor . How are you ? 
 So , are you going to go to class tonight ? 
 Really ? What's the matter ? 
 Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . 

I can't believe how hot it is . 
 That means it will get hotter . 
 Turn on the air conditioner . 
 What happened ? 
 Did you call the repairman ? 
 When is he coming ? 

Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 And I bet you studied , too . 
 Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . 
 Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! 
 I work for Thomas Cook Travel . 
 I'm a guide . I take people on tours to countries in South America , like Peru . 
 Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ? 
 Oh ? Where do you work ? 
 Which restaurant ? 

Do you like jazz , Tom ? 
 Well , yes , I do . I'm a real fan of Wanton Marsalis . 
 No , he doesn't ! ! ! He plays the trumpet . So , what kind of music do you like ? 
 Who's your favorite group ? 
 No , I don't . I can't stand them ! ! 
 Fine . And you ? 
 That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . 
 Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . 
 Well , my sister is a lawyer . 
 Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret . 
 He's a painter . He's working in Argentina this month . He has an exhibition there . 

I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ? 
 It's at 8: 00 . 
 Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late . 
 That sounds fine . 
 Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? 
 Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . 
 Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . 
 That's why people's achievement varies greatly . 
 Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? 
 Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? 
 Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . 

Look at this headline , Soo Mi . 
 Is it the same in Korea ? 
 Do people get married young ? 
 Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? 

People are funny . 
 Did you hear about the pilot ? 
 Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . 
 Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway . 
 No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant . 
 His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down . 

The police need our help finding a robber . 
 The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . 
 Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . 
 They didn't say . 
 Of course not . That would be racist . 
 Don't ask me . 

How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ? 
 And when did you come to Los Angeles ? 
 Oh . What was your major ? 
 That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ? 

Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ? 
 Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ? 
 I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ? 
 All right ! Thanks ! 
 I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ? 
 Sounds great ! 
 Do you mean it ? I'd love to ! 
 Yes , I'm teaching math at Lincoln High School . 
 Well , the salary is a little low , but the students are nice . How are things with you ? 
 Now that's an exciting job ! ! ! 

Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! 
 Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! 
 Well , you look great ! How are you ? 
 That's terrific ! 
 It was terrific . I really enjoyed it . 
 I was there for about three weeks . 
 Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago . 
 Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . 
 Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by . 
 Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you . 
 Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty . 
 No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago . 
 Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby . 
 Sure , which beach are we going to ? 
 I like Santa Monica . 
 I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . 
 Is Malibu beach nice ? 
 So you want to go to Malibu ? 
 Sure , let's go to Malibu . 
 Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? 
 Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? 
 That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . 
 Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . 
 Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . 
 I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words . 
 It seems that you don't like him . 

How are you feeling , John ? 
 Do more exercises after you are healthy . 
 Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? 

Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate . 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 

Hello . I'm Jason . 
 Nice to meet you , Dolma . 

Maybe we all will be all things to all men . 
 But for the life , we'll be changed by this society . 
 Don't be silly . We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves . 

Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . 
 My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? 
 Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ? 
 I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . 
 It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . 
 Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri . 
 Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . 
 Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . 
 And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . 
 In what ways ? 
 Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? 
 Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! 
 But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . 

Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? 
 Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . 
 Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . 
 What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . 
 Of course . 

What had make you so upset ? 
 What ’ s wrong with that ? 

I hear that you are in love with Mike . 
 Don't you hit it off ? 

What a beautiful view , my sweetheart ! 
 What is that below ? 
 No , thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me . 
 Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . 
 You are so romantic , my sweetheart . 
 He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . 

I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue . 
 It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now . 

I feel that Bob ’ s father-in-law is a hard nut to crack . 
 But his daughter is a very nice girl . 
 I said he was nothing but a yeoman . 
 Yes . 
 Why are you so kind to him ? 
 So that's how it is ! Now he ’ s in trouble , but I belive he will rise to his own feet again . 

How is grandpa doing recently ? 
 Maybe I would talk with him someday . 

The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . 
 Today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . 
 Yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do . 
 Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . 
 Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . 

It's said that John's broken up . 
 I hear that John's leading a double wife . 

I don't know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has loused up my business several times . 
 Yeah . 

Bob is really disturbed these days . 
 But we cannot talk like elders . 

I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . 
 Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . 
 You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . 

Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . 
 If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . 

Why are you going out with Andy ? 
 Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . 
 I did , but he gives me a runaround . 
 But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . 
 I enjoy camping . 
 I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think . 
 Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles . 
 Yes , but I threw them back . 
 Great ! I can't wait . 
 That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . 

How do you like Tom ? 
 Are you ready to welcome him ? 

Hi , Craig ! How are you ? 
 Really ? That's too bad ! You should be at home in bed . It's really important to get a lot of rest . 
 And have you taken anything for it ? 
 Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! 

Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . 
 Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . 

It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . 
 Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? 
 You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . 

Do you know who that tall man is ? 
 Why ? 

How is he ? 
 Did he see the doctor ? 
 Why ? 

I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? 
 That's a crying shame . It really is ! 

Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? 
 That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? 
 What did it say about you then ? 
 But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . 
 For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . 
 I was thinking about it . Are you ? 
 Really ? Well , what time does it start ? 
 Well , who all is going to be there ? 
 How do you know it's going to be so fun ? 
 Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . 
 Yeah , I will be there . 
 I didn't have any big plans . 
 That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? 
 Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? 
 I am assuming that the dress is casual . 
 Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . 
 I am not sure . What are you doing ? 
 That sounds like a great idea ! 
 Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? 
 That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? 
 Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you . 
 Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? 
 That sounds great . Is it casual ? 
 That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . 
 That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? 
 Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . 
 Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? 
 Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ? 
 I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? 
 Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine . 
 Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink . 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 Hi , Malia ! What a nice home ! 
 How long have you lived here ? 
 Well , it is very beautiful . 
 Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside ! 
 Mango juice would be perfect . Thank you ! 
 Yes , it has been a long time ! 
 I think that we last saw each other two years ago . 
 I have been going to graduate school at USC . 
 I am studying international communications . 
 I am counting on being able to get a good job . 
 Yes . I miss you very much . 
 Have you graduated from college ? 

I'm so glad to meet you . 
 Fine . 
 Really ? Thank you . 
 Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 

Good afternoon ! 
 I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? 
 Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . 
 What's the weather like in your country ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Here.Near this school . 
 Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? 
 Good . See you ! 

Which season do you like best ? 
 Why ? 
 I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . 
 I don't know . 
 Don't waste time . 
 But it's none of our business . 
 We'd better go out for a walk . 
 Spring . 
 I dislike it most . 
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 

Look at the cloud . 
 Let's go quickly . 
 Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? 
 You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? 
 On 20th May 1963 . 
 27th day of the fourth month . 
 It will begin at 5:30 . 
 You can see it tomorrow . 

Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? 
 Tell me about it , will you ? 
 Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? 
 You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? 
 So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 

I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . 
 Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? 

I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . 
 Oh , that's too bad , Where can you park around here ? 
 Is a shop there ? 

Do you often surf the Internet ? 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 Oh , I'll have a try . 
 Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . 
 It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . 
 Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . 

Hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . 
 Yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 
 That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . 
 Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 
 That is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . 
 Not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . 
 Really ? I haven't heard of it . 
 Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! 
 He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . 
 Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . 
 Oh , I make a phone call once a month . 
 Yeah . 
 Is it convenient and cheap ? 
 Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? 
 I'll appreciate it very much . 
 What's the trouble ? 
 What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? 
 Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? 
 I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent . 
 Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . 

It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . 
 Birds of feather flock together . 
 You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . 
 You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . 
 I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . 
 But most bosses are fools for woman . 
 Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . 

How old are you ? 
 I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . 
 Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
 Thanks.Miss Zhang . 
 Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . 
 It's Ellie and her friends . 
 She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " . 
 She's ten . 
 Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? 
 Today ? 
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 
 Very much.What time ? 
 I'll be at your house at about 5:30 . Happy birthday . 
 I have an idea . 
 You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . 
 Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? 
 Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . 
 Ok , see you tonight ! Don ’ t be late ! 
 I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . 
 Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . 
 Hey , I still know my name . 
 She said I have a fever but nothing major . 
 What if this small fever turns into a big fever ? 

Can you speak Japanese ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 How long have you been learning it ? 
 Can you speak any other languages ? 

Hi Mary , how's it going ? 
 Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 That's pretty harsh . 
 You know she probably feels just as bad . 
 Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . 

Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? 
 Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . 
 So there are only five working days in a week ? 
 I'm going to study . 
 Well , I need to polish up my English . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? 

Where should I sit ? 
 Okay . 
 It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N . 
 My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin . 
 Lin is a common Chinese last name . 
 So I hear . 
 After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back . 
 Come off it . 
 Why not ? 
 Really ? When did that happen ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 

Mary , Pam and I are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes . Do you want to come ? 
 Pam and I are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us . 
 Sink ? 
 Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation . 
 But give yourself some time . You just got here . 
 Is he really ? 
 Who is he marring ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 

Lisa , I'm home . 
 Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . 
 Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? 
 That's what Pam said . 

Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ? 
 Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here . 
 Of course . 
 It's 555-4321 . 

How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? 
 Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . 

Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Oh right ... How about Sunday ? 
 Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok . 
 Oh great , I ’ ll see you there ! 
 We planned our wedding for next May . 
 Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . 
 Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . 

I like pop music very much . 
 I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 

Isn't it wonderful walking here ? 
 I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . 
 It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 
 What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 
 What's there after that ? 
 What are they all for ? 

I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . 
 If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . 
 Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . 
 Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . 
 It was wonderful , but I was so tired . 
 Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there . 
 Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . 
 Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . 
 On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . 
 You'll have to try for yourself some day . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? 

You're from New York , aren't you ? 
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
 No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . 
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 It wasn't always like this , you know . 
 Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . 
 Certainly , perhaps . 
 I'm glad that you can make it . 
 Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you . 
 We all keep our shoes on indoors . 
 They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . 

We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? 
 What about a factory tour ? 
 Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 Exactly . 
 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
 Yeah . 
 Nice to meet you guys . 
 Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? 
 He sure is ! 

It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 Is she American ? 
 So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 
 Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 
 That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 
 Good luck ! 

Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . 

Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ? 
 Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . 
 Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . 
 When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . 
 Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . 
 Thanks , I think so too . 
 Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
 Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . 
 There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 

Good news ! 
 The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . 

I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 What airline and what flight ? 
 I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m . 

I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . 
 Because he is often in trouble . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Well , things are all right . 
 Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . 
 She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " 
 I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . 
 No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . 
 That's the plan . 

I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love . 
 Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories . 
 Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other . 
 Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 
 Yeah , that's nice . 
 A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? 
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 
 Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me . 
 Thanks a lot . You are so kind . 
 What happened ? 
 How did you find him at last ? 
 It must have taught you a lesson this time . 
 No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . 
 It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . 
 That must be a long love story . 
 They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ? 

Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep . 
 And I need to stretch my legs now . 
 Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . 
 How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! 
 I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . 
 Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . 

What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? 

Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ? 
 Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills . 
 Yes that might be a better idea . 
 Ok - let ’ s do that then ! 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . 
 You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . 
 You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . 
 I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . 
 No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . 
 She told me that she's got tennis practice today . 
 How did you know ? 
 I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? 
 Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman . 

I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 
 Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . 

We used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship . 
 I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him . 
 I wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision . 
 It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . 
 And the people were so friendly ! 
 Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? 
 I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . 
 Maybe we can come here again next summer . 
 Hey , what's the time ? 
 Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . 
 Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . 
 Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well . 
 You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street . 
 Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . 

It's very kind of you to come and see us off . 
 We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . 
 My wife and I will look forward to it . 
 lt's Flight No . 302 , Northwest Orient Airlines . 
 Then we've got to get going . 
 Thank you again for all your help . 

Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . 
 But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
 Well , only you liked it really , darling . 

I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . 
 I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . 

Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 

Guess who I saw just now ? 
 John Smith , the escaped criminal . 
 I think I must report to the cops . 

Cindy , I have this room to myself ? 
 It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan ! 
 I think I'm going to like it here . 
 Wow , I have my own bathroom ! 
 We share the same bathroom , in other words . 
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
 How have you been ? 
 Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? 
 Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? 
 Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . 
 I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
 I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . 
 I know . But I couldn ’ t help . 
 She is going to get married . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . 

How is Rose now ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . 
 His girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her . 
 Love is blind , you know . 
 Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . 

What a police officer ! 
 It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . 
 She must be a good wife . 
 I see . 
 I wouldn't do it if I were you . 
 It's very dangerous , you know . 
 It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . 
 Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . 
 What was wrong ? 
 I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . 

So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ? 
 Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . 
 Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . 

Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . 
 I wish I were a hero . 
 How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
 Me , too . What did you have in mind ? 
 I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan 
 The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . 
 I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
 There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . 

How ’ s your trip going ? 
 Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? 
 I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? 
 And what about the number of people on the streets ? 

Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? 
 Sitcoms ? 
 In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . 

Have you been to Shanghai before ? 
 That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? 
 So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? 

Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ? 
 Oh wow . How was it ? 
 Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . 
 What a great idea . 
 Oh I fell over on the way to work . 
 Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn ’ t call you . 
 It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . 

Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . 
 Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . 
 Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? 

Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold . 
 Well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking . 

How did you meet your boyfriend , Cindy ? 
 Who made the first move ? 
 Wow ! 
 What do your parents think of your dating a boy ? 
 They're glad ? ! 
 No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order . 
 You can ’ t imagine what he is like now . 
 Dinner ? Where ? 
 What kind of food do they serve ? 
 Oh really ! That sounds lovely . 
 Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . 
 But I don't know what to do . 
 My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . 
 Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . 
 Are you angry , Lisa ? 
 Please don't tell my mom . 
 I'm glad that you see it that way . 
 Thank you so much , Lisa ! 
 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! 
 So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 

Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? 
 What are they ? 
 Why ? 
 That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . 
 What's that ? 
 Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . 
 You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . 
 So what happened ? 
 You should have kept trying . 
 That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
 Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ? 
 That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . 
 Sure , I ’ ll catch the train . If I can ’ t catch the train , I ’ ll get a taxi . 
 If he doesn ’ t understand me , I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card . 
 I ’ ll call you if I ’ m delayed . 
 It's Gone With the Wind . 
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 

I am exhausted . I need some sleep . 
 I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health . 

Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? 
 Why ? 
 I agree with you . 
 I ’ m going to Hainan . 
 Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . 
 Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! 

I like football best of all . 
 It's a very good game . 
 I only watch now . 
 You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . 

Every country should face the history . 
 Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . 
 I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . 
 How can you be so sure ? 

Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Oh I see . So what did you do then ? 
 Ahh . And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ? 

How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ? 
 Oh really ? What did you do ? 
 I see . Anything else ? 
 Well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself . 
 I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . 
 Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . 
 Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 

How ’ s your father ? 
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 
 In the same way , probably . 
 For almost two years . 
 Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . 
 Oh , yes . Beautiful . 
 No , I am from France . 
 No , I don't think we have . 
 How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood . 
 Really ? I am glad to meet you . 

Can you tell me a little about Paris ? 
 I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... 
 That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? 
 Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? 
 Sounds exciting . I can't wait . 
 Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ? 

Have you ever been to Britain ? 
 Really ? How often do you go there ? 
 Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ? 

What a good day ! 
 Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery . 
 Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery . 
 I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey . 
 I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good . 
 Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends . 
 What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
 Shall we go out tomorrow then ? 

So John , have you ever been to China before ? 
 Have you travelled to many other countries ? 
 What about America ? Have you ever been to the United States ? 

Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ? 
 It's probably jet lag . 
 Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? 
 Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . 
 Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . 
 I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . 
 What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . 
 Let ’ s go then . 
 I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet . How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ? 
 Do you think I should wear a different dress ? 
 Thanks for saying . Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ? 
 Thanks for helping out . Now that I ’ m ready , what are you doing tonight ? 
 Sounds fun . Anyone I know ? 
 Sounds Like I'm missing out on a good time . Oh , well , there is always next year . 

Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . 
 They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls . 
 Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors . 
 No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... 

The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 
 Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
 Port , please . 
 The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 
 Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . 
 It's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
 OK , here's to your health . 
 Cheers . 
 I am happy . I just bought a new car . 
 It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . 
 Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . 
 It ’ s red and black . 
 Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . 
 It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? 
 You're back already . That sure was quick . 
 Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 It ’ s big and exciting but noisy . 
 You can see the Forbidden City . 
 It ’ s beautiful but crowded . 
 Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm . 
 Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . 
 Because too many people in the office are on holiday . 
 Well , she ’ s tall and pretty . 
 I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . 
 No , she ’ s not as clever as me . 

Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? 
 Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . 
 Sure . Bring enough films , please . 

What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? 
 So , you also like Coffee ? 
 Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . 
 But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction 
 Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! 
 You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . 

Haven't seen you for a long time 
 I bet you had a wonderful time 
 Sounds great 
 I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation 
 I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter . 
 To the beach 
 Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends 
 Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy . 
 You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . 
 Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking 
 That's right 
 Last night 
 Yes , I enjoyed it very much . 
 Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain 
 Two weeks 
 That's right 
 Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace 
 It's on the other side of the Palace . 
 Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen . 
 Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today . 

When is your birthday ? 
 Do you usually have a birthday party ? 
 What would you do at the party ? 
 Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? 
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune . 
 Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
 Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . 
 Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? 
 I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty . 

Do you want black or white coffee ? 
 Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ? 
 What kind of music do you like ? 
 Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep 
 It ’ s true . 
 So are you ! How about another coffee ? 
 That ’ s all right . I understand . 
 That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . 
 It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
 That's true . 
 Oh , not too bad . I'm just glad the weekend's finally here . 
 Give me a screwdriver on the rocks . 
 Thanks . 
 I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . 
 Can I bring my camera with me ? 
 I sure will . 
 Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre 
 Please come in 
 I was preparing my supper but I've finished now . 
 Oh ! yes 
 Oh , I took up a new hobby . 
 No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . 
 It certainly is . It's so much fun . 
 Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . 
 You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . 
 Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections . 
 Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . 
 See you , Frank . 
 What happened ? 
 Let's buy some flowers , and pay her a visit 
 OK . Let's go 
 My father failed in business . 
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . 
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . 
 Thank you . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ? 

Jack and Mary broke up . 
 Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . 
 How so ? 
 Poor Mary ! She really liked him . 
 Do you think they ’ ll get back together ? 
 I hope she ’ ll recover soon . 

How's it going ? 
 To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 Sure , but how ? 
 But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 Easier said than done . 
 But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 

Have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ? 
 I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . 

Hello ? 
 Nothing . Just watching TV . 
 Sure . What time ? 
 Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ? 
 All right . See you then . 
 Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . 
 Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... 
 Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . 
 Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . 
 That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
 Thank you . 

This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . 
 Yes , I mean it . 
 No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . 
 I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . 
 I ’ m sorry . 
 Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . 
 I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . 
 Sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
 Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ? 
 I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ? 
 It ’ s my treat this time . 

What ’ s your new job like ? 
 Um . 
 Very nice . 
 Well , that ’ s life , isn ’ t it ? 
 Nothing . 
 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . You said it . 
 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
 What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . 
 Call the police . 
 Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 How about going hunting with me ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll pick you up around 6 

Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? 
 Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . 
 I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
 That ’ s why many people look up to him . 
 I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . 
 And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . 
 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 

Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 
 I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . 
 I guess so . 
 I got my father ’ s goat last night . 
 When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . 
 It ’ s none of my business . 
 I don ’ t say that . But it seems to me the housewife should do that . 
 Hum ... 
 A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . 
 Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . 

The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
 It is incredible . 

To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! 
 Galileo is one of them . 

You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? 
 If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . 

Does Tom drink a lot ? 
 That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . 
 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . 
 I went to Paris . 
 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
 Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . 
 What does his dad say ? 

You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 
 But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? 
 So beat the cat , but don't kill it . 
 He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . 
 Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . 
 Joe ? I don't know what you mean . 
 Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . 

It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . 
 Government is making efforts to change situation . 

Where is Tom ? 
 What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . 
 You are so thoughtful . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Yeah . He has no one to count on . 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 
 John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing . 

You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 
 But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . 

What will you do now ? Propose to her . 
 You should strike while the iron is hot . 

You know that ? Dan got a divorce . 
 Yeah . But his relation with Sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife . 

May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . 
 Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread . 

When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
 I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
 Are you sure of that ? 
 They may have some difficulty in doing it . 
 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Last night he told the children acliff-hangerstory and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
 It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . 
 That give us a good lesson . 
 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
 I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
 It's too late . 
 That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . 
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . 
 Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
 Don't you see I'm trying my best ? 
 Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . 
 She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? 
 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 
 Sure . I didn ’ t know you liked mysteries . 

Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 That's what friends are for . 
 I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . 
 I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . 
 I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . 
 Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . 
 I didn't really like it . 
 I found it very disappointing . 
 I wasn't happy with it . 

The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 You dance beautifully too . 
 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 How about tango ? 
 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 

I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . 
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
 What a bummer ! You set me up ? 
 How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) 
 Why did you lie to me in the email ? 
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . 

Hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 
 You mean the boy you met on MSN ? 
 You must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! 
 I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . 
 Did you tell him ? 
 You shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . 
 I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . 
 But promise me , you'll keep it a secret . 
 I've fallen in love with my boss . 
 Bo , of course not . He is still single . 
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
 Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . 
 It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . 

John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . 
 What is your idea ? 

How did Jim get the money ? 
 He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . 

What would you reckon the taxing increases ? 
 But what do most people think about it ? 

Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 

I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . 
 I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 

John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan . 

I don ’ t know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has louse up my business several times . 
 Yeah . 

You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 

Where are you going ? 
 What's wrong with her . 
 Congratulations to you . 

Hello ? 
 Not yet . 
 I ’ d like to , but I can ’ t . 
 I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule . 
 Sure , thanks . 
 Bye . 
 And ? 
 Poor child ! 
 Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . 
 Let's get it back . 
 Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . 
 He is more nice than wise . 
 He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . 
 Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 
 So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 

I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . 
 I hope so . 
 Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? 
 Not bad , But she's as busy as before . 
 How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! 
 What happened ? 

Ben always appears rude to the people around him . 
 That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . 
 Yeah , some places are very short of water . 
 You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . 

I heard that Ann had divorced . 
 Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . 

Susan is going to get a divorce . 
 She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . 

I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . 
 You've take the words out of my mouth . 
 What's happening in that country ? 

John dates her seven times a week . 
 I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . 
 Right . 
 I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . 

Good afternoon , Johnson . 
 Not bad , thanks . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 I think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . 
 We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . 

Can you speak English ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 What else can you speak ? 

Hi , Mr . James , what's the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 He used to be a policeman . 
 Yeah . He's a private eye now . 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 It doesn't matter to me . 
 Either way . I don't care . 
 I couldn't careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don't mind if you want to . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 

David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 
 I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 I ’ m here as a tourist . 
 Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . 
 Oh really ? Is he all right ? 
 Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . 
 You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . 
 I hope I will meet her soon . 
 Why doesn't he ask her ? 
 He's a chicken guy . 
 what a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I am sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . 
 Yeah . But I have an appointment with Ann . 

Is this seat taken ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ? 
 Yes , I Went there once last summer . 
 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
 Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . 
 That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 

Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . 
 I feel sorry for her . 

Hi , Jenny . Are still working ? 
 So , you are leaving , aren't you ? 
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? And see if there is any mistake in it ? 
 Excuse me for taking your time . 

Um , which of them is the better typist ? 
 Is there any difference in their short hand ? 
 How about languages ? 
 Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . 
 I'm sorry . I forget all about it . 
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . 
 I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . 
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
 But I just want to give her some tips . 

Bob refused all his classmates ' invitations . 
 He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . 

Does your wife work ? 
 Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? 
 You are really a hen-pecked husband . 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 

All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . 
 Then why are you wearing black shoes ? 
 Hey , thanks , mum . 
 Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 . 
 Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? 

Did you go to the movie yesterday ? 
 What did you think of it ? 
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . 
 I can't think the same . 
 I couldn't agree with you . 
 If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . 
 She'd better keep away from them . 
 I think so too . It's just pointless . 
 I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy . 

Have you heard about Alice and David ? 
 No , they've got engaged . 
 Well , my dear , I didn't believe it either . But I got it straight from the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip . 
 Next June . 

My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race . 
 A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games . 
 You have to . It is sure . 

Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to live in . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 

You say he was around average height . 
 Weight ? 
 Any marks on his face ? 
 Glasses ? 
 What about his hair ? 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 
 Boy , this sure doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing ? 
 I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . 
 I can tell from the way he spoke to us . 

Do you think they two will get married ? 
 I think so . Yes , they get along so well . 
 You're right . He sure is . 
 I was the only one who got a strait A in my class . 
 Thank you . 
 Why ? Did tom pop the question ? 
 Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? 
 I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . 
 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . 
 Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . 
 He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . 
 Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . 
 Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I'm telling you now . 
 I didn't think you'd be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 

My old man always harps on me . 
 But I can't bear it , John . 
 Yeah , but he really puts blame on me . 
 Maybe it was Dick . 
 Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 Not particularly . I like fat girls . 
 I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . 
 Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . 
 Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . 
 Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
 Congratulations ! 

Hi , Natasha , how's life ? 
 Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . 
 Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . 
 The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . 
 Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . 
 Thank you . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 Oh , thank you so much . 
 I really appreciated it . 
 It was so kind of you . 
 You ’ re a real friend in need . 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 

Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ? 
 See you tonight then . 

Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . 

Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? 
 It ’ s for a book . 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 No , nothing . Why ? 
 Yes , I do , very much . 
 Oh , yes . I ’ d love to . 
 Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . 
 Then you will be in line for a doom . 
 Everything's great . And you ? 
 No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called " Chinese-Style Divorce " . 
 Yeah . I found it is so close to our life . 
 You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . 
 I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . 
 That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . 
 Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . 
 I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage . 
 Can't complain . What about you ? 
 I've heard . She looks quite depressed . 
 I heard they were just married for 5 months . 
 Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . 
 Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . 
 That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 Why don't you find someone who is in the know . 
 Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . 

Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? Come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 

What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? 
 Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? 
 What's the puzzle ? 
 Oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . 
 Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . 
 Definitely . 
 Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . 
 Sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 
 I'm very sorry I can't . 
 I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business . 
 Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
 Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . 
 Don't be scared . Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . 

You know John ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . 
 I wish he could too . 
 He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . 
 Good luck to them . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 

He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . 
 He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . 

What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 
 You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . 

What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . 
 OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . 
 Go ahead . 
 Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . 

I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth . 
 I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling . 

He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means . 
 Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ’ m noisy ? 

I ’ m fed up with marriage . 
 Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . 
 And we have some squabbles on some boring things . 

I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? 
 He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . 

You are starting to learn English ? 
 You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand . 

The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain . 
 I ’ m sure they will . 
 So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean ! 
 Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things . 
 Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others . 
 You know . I really don't those big hotels . 

He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . 
 I don ’ t understand . 

Good morning , Mary ! 
 I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? 
 Yes , if that's all right for you . 
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . 

I cannot stay here any more minutes . 
 Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . 

Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . 
 No , I just started working here at IBM , I am in the sale department . 
 I main market reasearch , and you ? 
 Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ? 
 Thanks , that's would be lovely.You ' r right , he is kind and nice looking . 
 What's that ? 
 Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? 
 That's the most important thing . 
 Forget about it . 
 Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . 

There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . 
 It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . 
 No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . 
 Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . 
 Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . 
 That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . 
 Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . 
 Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
 Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . 
 Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . 
 Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . 
 Alright . 
 Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . 
 Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . 
 Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? 
 I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? 

Hello , Bessie . 
 My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . 
 Thank you very much . 
 What's that ? 
 Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? 
 The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? 
 My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? 
 Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? 
 Who is the best man ? 
 Nobody is OK , but you ! 
 Did you promise him ? 

Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? 
 Are you feeling better ? 
 Do you need anything , grocery ? 
 Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? 

In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ? 
 Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ? 

Hi , Lucy ! 
 Yes , It's very great . 
 You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money . 
 Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet . 

What a nice tie you are wearing ! 
 Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly . 
 Yes.You look very smart today . 

This is my house.Let me show you around it . 
 Follow me to the back-yard . 
 We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . 
 Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . 

Is this Zhang Lin's home ? 
 Yes , please . I'm a little thirsty , actually . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Would you like to talk over a drink ? 
 Just fine.Are you busy now ? 
 Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ? 
 How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ? 

So how long have you know Jack ? 
 Really ? You guys must be really tight . 
 He seems sincere , and trustworthy . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that . 
 So , can I trust him or what ? 
 But I need someone that I can count on for this job . 
 Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight . 

My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry . 
 She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . 
 Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? 
 My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . 
 She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . 
 I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . 
 Oh yes , how's she getting on ? 
 What , from Peter ? 

Do you feel all right ? You look Pale . 
 Have you taken your temperature ? 
 How long have you been feeling this way ? 
 Oh , probably you've been working too hard . 

Here comes the birthday cake . 
 Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff . 
 Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it . 

Hello ? Is that Mark ? 
 I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ? 
 Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing . 
 That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . 

Happy Birthday , Mary ! 
 Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . 
 I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . 
 Really ? It looks so nice . 
 All right . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake . 
 No , just a small one.Next Let's sing " Happy Birthday " to Mary . 

Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ? 
 When's the wedding going to be ? 
 Are you having a big wedding ? 
 But what do you say about that ? 
 Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before . 
 $ 120.The small gift box is complementary . 
 Thank you ! Have a nice day ! 

How do you like your job here , Linda ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . 
 Do you have any complaints ? 
 Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . 

It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . 
 Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ? 
 Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . 

Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . 
 We don't . 
 At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . 
 In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . 

This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . 
 Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . 
 Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . 
 What sort of western food do you like best ? 
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . 
 It's still early . 
 What's changed ? 
 I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy . 
 You should have more money then . 

How was the party yesterday ? 
 Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had . 
 Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . 
 I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . 
 Miss ! 
 My name is Jane Brown ! 

May I have your attention please ? 
 Well , my speech isn't very long . Would you please ... 

Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . 
 Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . 
 Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . 
 I'm studying medicine . 
 At Harvard . What about you ? 
 Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . 
 Good . I'm starving . 
 Much better today . 
 It's a girl . 
 Sure.She is a peaceful child . 
 So they say . 
 Well.The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth . 

I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time . 
 After three baby girls in a row , Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws.They want a boy in the worst way now . 
 I agree with you , but you know how old-fashioned the elders are . 
 Hello.May I speak to Mark , please ? 
 Hello , this is Mark speaking . 
 Oh , we had a birthday party for David last night . As a matter of fact I woke up with a terrible hangover . 
 Anything new at the office ? 
 That's wonderful ! We've got to celebrate ! 
 Sure . I ought to be ready for some more drinks by then.Thank you for calling . 

So , Paula , where are you from ? 
 From Canada ? Where were you born ? 
 When did you come to Los Angeles ? 
 Did you go to school here ? 
 Did you get a job right after graduation ? 
 When was that ? 
 I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? 

I want to say goodbye to everyone . 
 I ’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning . 
 You really don ’ t need to . 
 I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . 
 Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . 
 Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . 
 Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . 
 But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 
 Thanks for coming . 
 Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . 
 Good night then . 

Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning . 
 I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . 
 Thank you . 
 Bye . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? 
 Yes , I was.You work for 3M , right ? 
 Good . 
 I ’ m a fashion designer.Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets.So you can bring a friend if you like . 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah , I've been there twice . 
 Oh , it's fantastic . 
 On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto . 
 Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too . 
 And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive . 
 Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city . 
 I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity . 

Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? 
 You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! 
 When did you change your mind ? 
 I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? 
 Really ? How long did you stay there ? 
 And what did you do after that ? 

So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ? 
 Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping . 
 But the traffic is pretty bad . 
 Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ? 
 OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ? 
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . 
 Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? 
 How was it ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . 
 Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! 
 Give me your email , would you ? 

I really should be on my way . 
 No , thank you . I can ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . I had a really good time . 
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . 
 ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . 
 It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . 

Good morning Mike ! 
 I am having an exam at nine , It's already eight thirty . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it . 
 Yes , It's only eight forty . Thanks so much ! 
 Have a nice day , bye ! 
 Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations ! 
 Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 This is it ? 

Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ? 
 Which city did you like better ? 
 And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ? 
 Which one has better nightlife ? 
 Well , I've always wanted to see Vancouver . I've heard it has the most beautiful views . 
 Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . 
 Is there something you need ? 
 Yes , I have nothing to do . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . 
 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 
 OK.Then I'll be expecting you . 

I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! 
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
 I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 

Billy , you are late again . 
 Yes he ' s in his office . 
 Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . 
 I think he might . You'd better go to his office . 
 Good luck ! 
 Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . 
 No problem.Call me when you get back . 
 That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . 
 Great ! That's settled then . 

You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? 
 I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . 
 You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . 

Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . 
 There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . 
 What about sunday ? 
 Maybe next week . 
 Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . 

Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday . 
 If you are free , maybe you can get having for my birthday party , it should be fun . 
 Around six pm . 
 No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer . 
 Great . I have a good day , thanks again for the offer . 
 Out of sight , out of mind . 
 Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ? 
 So I heard . 
 She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . 
 It ’ s a typical of them to do so . 
 We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it . 
 You did ? that is great ! 
 No i am free , i will be there , what time the thing starting ? 
 Ok , great , should i bring anything ? 
 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 
 Got it . 
 I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . 
 That ’ s too bad . She ’ s been so kind to us all . 
 A gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave this place the soonest . 
 Stop your nonsense ! Quick . Let ’ s leave the place ! 
 Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in . 

What does your friend Jim do ? 
 He can repair cares ? I cannot believe it . 

When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . 
 I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . 

Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children . 
 That ’ s human nature . 
 Hi , Debbie . Have a seat . How's it going ? 
 Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ? 
 That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ? 
 Great . I'll call and make reservations . 
 All right . I'll call you tonight and tell you the time . 

Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ? 
 Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party . 
 Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . 
 Oh ... that's too bad . 
 Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well . 
 At eight sharp.How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ? 
 Sure ! 

Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . 
 I feel life is meaningless without him . 

My mother likes to split hairs . 
 She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper . 

I am tired of everything in my life . 
 You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . 

Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one . 
 No wonder . 
 Why ? 
 Really ? Congratulations . 
 You are pulling my legs ! 

Look out ! Your tea water is running over . 
 Sure . 

John passed away . 
 Yesterday . He suffered from a serious disease . When he saw the red light , it was too late . 

I don ’ t know why I married him . 
 He never see eye to eye with me . 

Are you telling us a lie again ? 
 All right . But what was the trouble ? 

Your face is so red , you must running a temperature . 
 Please go to see a doctor . 

Mary and I decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair . 
 Don ’ t make a fuss . Many people divorce after having living together for many years . 

You seem to be unhappy . What happened ? 
 What does the doctor say ? 

I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband . 
 So what ? Things have changed . 
 No problem . I can deal with it well . 
 All is best now , isn ’ t it ? 
 Yes , I know . 
 At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . 
 I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . 
 What a pity ! 
 Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood . 
 You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain . 
 Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... 
 I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . 
 Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ? 
 He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . 
 What do you mean by cautious ? 
 Thats a clever way to escape responsibility . 
 He is playing hob with the fact . 
 Because he stayed with me all the time that night . 
 Yeah , I know . 

We quarreled yesterday , and he picked up and left . 
 I am not sure . 

I have no idea about what to do next . 
 Let me have a try . 
 It is very hard , you know . 
 Good luck ! 
 I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . 
 How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 Maybe all of us are the same . 
 That cat . 
 It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry . 
 Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . 

He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool . 
 So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg . 
 Exactly . Herry is almost broken now . 
 It it true of many countries . 
 Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . 
 Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? 
 You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . 
 I thought she would marry a fortune . 
 Who do you think that has the motive ? 
 OK , murder will out ! 

How are you going all these days ? 
 But you look depressed . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How about your family ? 

Are you really dating with Frank ? 
 Then why not keep away from him ? 
 That ’ s stupid . 
 Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . 
 Yes . Do you know its name . 
 Oh , I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father . 
 Don ’ t be fool . I ’ ll always side with you . 

What do you think of Frank ? 
 Why do you say that ? 

Susan has got married . 
 Her marriage was a hole and corner affair . 
 I have no idea . Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us ... , so ... 
 You said it . We ’ er breathing poisonous air every day . 
 I absolutely agree with you . 
 You tried to seduce me . I fell for you . 
 I am just thinking of it . Maybe I ’ ll go . 
 It ’ s severe punishment , I think . 
 No wonder . 
 Why ? 
 It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time . 
 Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . 
 Then he is really lucky . 
 No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . 
 Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . 
 It seems that he has gone ape over the girl . 
 Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . 
 Yeah . But he just didn ’ t listen . 
 Why should I go against her ? She always seems to have better ideas . 
 Get the goods on her ? She never allows me to go to her office . And she is a good woman . She has been faithful all these years . 

I want to give our kitchen the works . 
 No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . 
 I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . 
 Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one . 
 Yeah . This is a big house with a garden . I like it very much . 
 It is very quiet and peaceful . This is what I want . 
 I know what love it . When I was young , I felt the same way . 
 You are , why not ask for a date ? 
 I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . 
 You are right . 
 Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . 

When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . 
 Yes , I knew I would make it . 

Mr . Brown is in hospital again . 
 When I went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale . 

She lives a happy life after marriage . 
 Lucky her . 
 That ’ s really unbearable . 
 So get prepared for everything . 
 Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? 
 Fortunately , things are changing these years . 
 For what reason . 
 He had better make a change . 
 There are not so many people like you . 

He was hauled up last week for the second time . 
 Of course , he is a man with a history . 

I hated the hand-me-downs to wear when I was a kid . 
 It was not just that . I didn ’ t like them because they never fitted me . 
 I ’ m going to the hospital . 
 Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident . 
 His life is hanging by a thread , and he is under an emergency treatment . 
 Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . 
 But he still does not come back . 

Our national economy is increasing hand over fist . 
 I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time . 
 Yeah , he came back from America last week . 
 He must have a good ear . 
 What do you have to do to grease the palm of him ? 
 You can go and ask your father . 
 I know . But my life seems super stressful . I really don ’ t know how to get a better grab on things . 

My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . 
 You mean I should please her by following her suggestion . 

Do you know that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
 I saw her husband have it out with her yesterday . 

Tom and Helen got married at last . 
 I was invited to attend their wedding . 
 How moving love is . 
 No problem . You know him . He ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles . 
 I bet he will come . 
 I don ’ t think so . 
 The government will never fulfill their promise . 

John has some trouble in his life . 
 Yeah . He ’ s been having an easy time since he was a boy , and now he doesn ’ t know how to face the music . 

One family skeleton of my family was that my younger brother has an axe to grind . 
 He began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune . 

He is planning again . 
 That is him . 
 Ask John . He is sure to know about it . 
 He has a finger in the pie . 
 I am worrying about my husband . 
 You know , he is a taxi driver . He has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives , especially during the rush hour . 
 Where are you going ? 
 You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? 

Are you have a hand in locking into the case ? 
 How do you feel about it ? 

Mike has changed much after marriage . 
 It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . 
 Which flight ? 
 How about the passengers ? 

I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . 
 I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . 

More and more women don ’ t want to stay at home and keep house now . 
 Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ? 

I ’ ll be away for a moment . 
 Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? 

Have you finished your work ? 
 Where is the baby ’ s mother ? 

Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper . 
 I ’ m afraid if the noise goes on , I shall have no alternative but to leave . 

Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day . 
 I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Oh , why not ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself . 

I hear you and James are engaged at last . 
 When are you getting married ? 
 Oh , lovely.Where ' s the wedding going to be ? 
 Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ? 
 Where are you going to live after you're married ? 
 Are you going to give up your job ? 

Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 

Did you bring some lunch with you ? 
 Wow , that looks beautiful . 
 I might try it myself . 
 Fine ! How are you ? 
 I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
 It will be held at the Music Hall . 
 It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? 
 How much was the ticket ? 

Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? 
 May I introduce myself ? 
 I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 

Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought . 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's not the gadgets.Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . 
 Would you like me to go with you ? 
 Do you want to type that letter ? 
 Do you want to tell her ? 

Are you going out again ? 
 You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . 
 No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . 
 OK . Here's the key . Take care . 

You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . 
 It says No smoking here . 
 I didn't really like it . 
 I found it very disappointing . 
 I wasn't happy with it . 

Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 

John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? 
 I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 I ’ m watching TV . 
 I will . 

Hi , how ’ re you doing ? 
 Oh , what ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? 
 Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . 
 Well , you ’ d better get some rest . 
 Bye . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That ’ s sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to help . 
 All you have to do is ask for help . 
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . 
 Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? 
 I believe industry is making us wealthier . 
 And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . 
 I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . 

John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . Actually , I ’ m a Beijing Opera fan . 

Would you like something to eat ? 
 Would you like to call home ? 
 Please use the phone . 

Cigarette ? 
 Sorry , here . 
 I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . 

When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot . 
 Certainly . 
 Not always . But they like good meal . 
 How can I go there to have a taste ? 

When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does six thirty suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty . 
 I mean it ’ s not his fault . 
 Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 Just last week . 
 Oh , I loved it . I only visited a couple of cities , you know . But I had a great time . 
 They ’ re nice . 
 Oh , that sounds great ! 
 Yes , that would be perfect . 
 Yes . Thank you for inviting me . 
 I ’ m not crazy about it at all . 
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
 I hate it . 
 It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . 
 It depends . 
 Um . It ’ s delicious . 
 Not all of it . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? 

Hi , what ’ re you reading ? 
 No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ? 
 Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 What did he say ? 
 Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? 
 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? 

Do I have to write the invitation cards ? 
 Oh , well . If I must , I must . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I used to play football regularly when I was at university.And I used to do athletics in the summer . 
 I was a runner_a long-distance runner . 
 No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 Pretty good , thanks . And you ? 
 The United Nations should have more authority . 
 What ? 
 Is it ? 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I'm telling you now . 
 I didn't think you'd be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 

What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us ? 
 What do you mean ? We're talking now , aren't we ? 
 Yes . I remember.But we never used to argue.You used to think I was wonderful.Where are you going ? 

Sorry.What was that you said ? 
 Where ? 
 When , did you say ? 
 Who's coming ? 
 Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside . 
 Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . 
 Of course ! Where are the things ? 
 Right ! I'll do it straight away . 

Could you just hold this for me ? 
 Yes , but I've nearly fixed it . Just take it , will you ? 

It's very dark in here.Will you turn on the light ? 
 Then , turn on the lamp , please . 
 It's there by the window . 
 Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? 
 That won't take long . 
 Well , I'm not quite ready . 
 You wouldn't do a thing like that ! 

What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . 
 Oh , that's really tough . 
 I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? 
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 

Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . 
 I hope so . 
 Oh really ? Is he all right ? 
 Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . 
 I ’ m here as a tourist . 
 Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . 
 What time dose it start ? 
 Then we'd better get started . 
 Yes . Can I ? 
 Yes . Is it OK with you ? 
 Yes . Do you mind ? 
 Yes . Will you let me ? 

You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Well . All right , Mark . Just this once . But you have to pick them up yourself . I ’ m a very busy man . 
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 There ’ s a possibility . 
 I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . 
 Absolutely . Take my word for it . 
 Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . 
 Ah , it ’ s hard to say . 
 Yes . I dare say it will be . 
 No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
 Mmm , you may be right . 
 No . We couldn ’ t possibly . 
 It will be summer . So it will be hot . 
 Yes . It could happen . 
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 

I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 Look at this one.It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
 Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big.Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
 Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ? 

I must be going now . 
 No , I really must go now . My family are expecting me home soon . 
 See you . 
 But I don ’ t have a pen with me . May I use a pencil ? 

My word , you do look ill ! 
 You seem to have something on mind . Promise me , go to see the doctor right now . 
 A piece of cake . You'll be successful . 
 I think we would be able to make it.What time shall we come ? 
 Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? 

The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ? 
 We met them in Bermuda last May . 
 The couple with the dogs , think back . 
 Well , I've invited them for brunch . 

We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 

What do you do for a living ? 
 Really ? Do you like it ? 
 I ’ m a bus driver . 
 No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . 
 To New York . 
 Tomorrow morning . 
 Three days . 
 On Friday . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 Why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 What question ? 
 You know that I care for you . I .. I ’ m proud of you . 
 I .. I don ’ t feel like saying it . 
 She works as a teller in a bank . 
 Yes . She goes three times a week . 
 She wants to be a manager . 
 She takes classes in accounting and business . 
 Quite well , Tom.And you ? 
 He's much better today . 
 See you later . 
 I ’ m waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park . 
 I always like to go for a walk before a supper . 

Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? 
 Do you go to work by train every day . 
 And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Which train do you catch in the evening ? 
 And can you get a seat ? 
 Would you agree that the service is fast ? 

When were you born may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am frigid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 See you . 
 Poor , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? 
 You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? 
 I'm going to Bill's house . 
 I'm going to help him . 
 He's fixing his roof . 
 Fine . 
 Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . 
 He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 

Hi ! How are you going ? 
 Not bad.How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Did you enjoy yourself ? 
 Thanks , I like looking at photographs.How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . 
 Goodbye . 
 What's her last name ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 How old is she ? 

Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? 
 Really ? What was the matter ? 
 Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? 
 Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 Well , I swim and run every day . 
 Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . 
 Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . 
 Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . 

Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
 You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
 So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 

Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight . 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 No thanks . I've had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 me . too i like the festival best of all . 
 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . 
 Such as ... 
 Why ? to welcome the new year of course . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . they always try to avoid tears and quarrels . 
 Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it . 
 Sure our thing . 
 Thanks . 
 Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return . 
 Yeah , that is what the holiday is for , isn't it ? 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! 
 Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . 

Have you got your invitation yet ? 
 The house warming party . 
 Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . 
 It's out in the suburbs . 
 Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . 
 Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . 
 Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? 
 When are they going to have the party ? 
 Wow , that would be something to look forward to . 
 Oh where was that ? 
 Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
 She will be 86 next month . 

Ah , ah , ah ... 
 Jog ? 
 Walk ? 
 Oh no . 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh no . 
 Dance class ! I don't know how . 
 Oh ... 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 

How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets ? 
 I'm glad you're so happy . 

What shall we do tonight ? 
 That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . 
 Oh , I don't know.It depends . 
 Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
 Hmm.Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
 Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
 It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
 OK . 

What's this , I wonder ? 
 A coffee grinder ? 
 Oh , that would be very useful . 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 It wasn't always like this , you know . 
 Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . 
 Certainly , perhaps . 
 I don't really feel like a walk . 
 All right.That sounds more interesting . 
 It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? 

Hello , is Jack there ? 
 Jack ! It ’ s Rose here . 
 Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . 
 Is six o ’ clock okay ? 
 Good evening , Mr . Smith . 
 No . I haven ’ t had the pleasure . 
 How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome . 
 Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests . 
 Hello , Helen . This is John . How are you ? 
 Fine , thanks . I ’ ll have a party next Sunday at home . I ’ m calling to ask whether you can come or not . 
 Okay , now you are a famous star . 
 What ’ s wrong with you ? 
 Okay . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? 

Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? 
 How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you . 
 Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home . 
 A cup of coffee , please . 
 How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you . 
 I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation . 

Hello , Jack here . 
 I ’ m working . I often work late on Thursday . I ’ m busy this week . 
 Tomorrow ? No , I am afraid I won ’ t be able to . I ’ m going on business to Birmingham . 
 Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . 
 Next Tuesday ? Just a moment . It will be the twenty-first of May ? Oh , dear . Hum , I promised my aunt I ’ ll be at her birthday party . 
 Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let ’ s make it next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ’ t stand on ceremony . 
 I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it . 
 Sure , we call it doubt . 
 I went to Yale University . 
 I have a B . A . in Economics . 
 I'm twenty-seven . 
 Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years . 
 I got $ 500 a week . 
 Thank you.Good evening , Mr.Dean . 
 I'm Helen Baker . 
 Glad to meet you , too . 
 I'm from New Zealand . 
 I'm a teacher . 

On Saturday night I ’ m going to have a small get-together . 
 Would you like to come ? 
 Yes , this coming Saturday . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 Well , perhaps , another time . 
 Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening . 
 Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? 

Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 

Good morning , Mr.Jones ! 
 Nice to see you again . 
 How is everything ? 
 Quite well , thank you . 
 No , I was driven by my husband . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . 
 It's Gone With the Wind . 
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . 
 That's a good idea.Let ' s go ! 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . 
 Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . 
 Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . 
 It ’ s pretty bad . 
 I am glad I did not drive a car . 
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 

Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? 
 How are you these days ? 
 Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . 
 Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . 
 I like taking photos out of doors . 
 Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . 
 Yes , simple as it is . It does work . 
 Not a great deal . 
 For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . 

Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? 
 Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? 
 well , I can ’ t just image it . 
 Hi , Tom.Want a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ? 
 No , Ah ... single sellers . 
 Uh huh.How about a used car ? They've got good ones now . 
 Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . 

Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
 Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? 
 See you . 
 Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you for your concern . 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 

Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time . 
 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 
 Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . 
 I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . 
 You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . 
 The weatherman predicts a fine day today . 

It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 

Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? 
 Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? 
 Yes . 
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
 In London.Where do you live ? 

Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 

Is there a city where it's always warm ? 
 Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? 
 But why do so many people live there ? 
 Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? 
 Tell us about some cold cities . 
 Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? 

Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? 
 I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . 
 Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! 
 Why ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 Silly , you should make sure he does . 
 He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant . 

Hey , did you hear the news ? 
 Miss Yang is dating the manager who's married . 
 No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . 
 I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
 If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . 
 I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . 
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 

What would you like to be in the future ? 
 But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . 
 Are you sure about that ? 

What's the problem ? You don't look happy . 
 How come ? 
 Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often ? 
 You should always keep in mind , the more you practice , the better English you can speak . 
 That's right . Do you think it'll be cold ? 
 Do you think I'll need a cotton coat ? 

Do you want a cigarette ? 
 You don't mind if I have one . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . 
 I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
 If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . 
 I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . 
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 

Excuse me , how can I fill in this blank ? What does marital status mean ? 
 No , I'm still single . 

Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way , do you have any children ? 

Which season do you like best ? 
 Why ? 
 I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . 
 Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 I'm glad I was able to help . 
 Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . 
 Thank you . 
 It was a pleasure . 
 I don't mind at all . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . 
 I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air . 
 To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . 
 Yes , my first marriage was a failure . 
 We'd better go out for a walk . 
 Spring . 
 I dislike it most . 
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 

What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? 

What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ? 
 How about going to English corner with me ? 
 Why not ? 
 That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 Sorry , they are too busy these days . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 What time are you going ? 
 Well , good-bye and have a good trip ! 

I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? 
 No , I just want to meet you . 
 Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? 

I've come to say good-bye . 
 I'm flying home on Sunday afternoon . 
 Please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care and give my best to your parents . 
 Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo . 
 That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 
 Sounds good . 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 

What's the bonus like at your company ? 
 Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! 
 Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . 
 What did you buy ? 
 Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . 
 No joke ! 

How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . 
 Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today . 
 Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here . 
 If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . 

Hello , Jill . 
 Fine , only a little tired . 
 Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence . 
 Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . 
 The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me . 
 I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them . 
 Not at all . 
 Yes , I did . I passed ! 
 Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . 
 You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You . 
 That's all tight , Mr.Smith.That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon . 
 No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . 

I think your speech was excellent . 
 Sure it was . 
 But you did it and did it well ! 
 What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ... 
 I see . Where are you now , Li ? 
 It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ? 
 That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock . 
 It doesn't matter.Bye . 

Why , Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here . 
 Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight . 
 What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there . 

I really like the book you lent me the other day . 
 And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
 Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting . 
 Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? 

You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? 
 You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . 
 It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? 

We can't wait any longer ... 
 You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? 
 All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? 
 Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . 

What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us ? 
 That's right . 
 I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . 
 You mean I am groaned a few words ? 

Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 

Many happy returns of the day , darling ? 
 And here is your birthday present . 
 Do you like it ? 

You ’ re all set now ? 
 Really , it was nothing . 
 I was happy to help . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 

Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? 
 It ’ s for a book . 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 
 That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . 
 I don ’ t really mind . 
 I suppose I could . 
 All right . If you really want to . 
 It doesn ’ t matter to me . 
 Either way . I don ’ t care . 
 I couldn ’ t careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
 So what ? 
 Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games . 

You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? 
 Really ? Congratulations ! 
 By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . 
 Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? 
 My pleasure . 
 What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? 
 Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film . 

I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 

Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? 
 Are you sure you cann't remember ? 
 Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? 
 Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? 
 Sure ? 

Do you take a bus to and from work ? 
 Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded . 
 That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . 
 You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! 
 Yeah , absolutely ! 
 You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? 

Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . 
 That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . 
 They see their independence as a kind of character strength . 

Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . 
 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
 Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . 
 That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . 

Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . 
 You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? 
 Do you ever get lonely living alone ? 

Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . 
 I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . 
 Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . 
 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
 And what did the program say ? 
 I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . 
 And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . 
 Umm ... I think so . What's up ? 
 Really ? Are you OK ? 
 If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . 
 Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . 
 Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . 
 That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . 
 Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? 
 You mean they're kicking you out ? 
 Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . 
 I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . 
 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . 
 That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . 
 Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . 
 They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . 
 Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . 
 Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . 
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 
 Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? 
 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . 
 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
 Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . 
 No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . 
 I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . 
 I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . 
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? 
 Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? 
 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 
 Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . 
 And then what ? 
 That sounds boring to me . 
 Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . 

Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? 
 Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! 
 Football of course ! 
 No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . 
 So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? 
 Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . 
 Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 
 Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! 
 Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 
 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 

Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 
 Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . 
 Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . 
 No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . 
 Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . 
 Hi , Don . What a surprise ! 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 
 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . 
 Sure . Join my class next week . 
 Wow ! Sure ! 
 Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! 
 I'd love to help if I can . 
 Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . 
 Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . 
 Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? 
 I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . 
 Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . 
 I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . 
 It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? 
 Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! 
 So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? 
 So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? 
 Coming as ? 
 Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . 
 Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . 
 Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . 
 Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . 
 Yes ! How did you guess that ? 
 Good Point ! 
 No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? 
 Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . 
 I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . 
 How much dose that cost ? 
 I think it ’ s a little expensive . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Wonderful . 
 Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . 

Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . 
 Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? 
 Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . 
 What happens then ? 
 I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . 
 We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? 
 What happened ? 
 Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! 
 Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? 
 A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . 

Who ’ s that ? 
 Oh , please come in . nice to see you . 
 Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house . 
 But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp . 
 It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . 
 That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . 
 It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . 
 And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . 
 No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . 
 Yeas , when will you buy a house ? 
 Right , congratulations . 

Did you move into your new apartment ? 
 Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . 
 Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . 
 Is there a supermarket nearby ? 
 Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . 

Can you believe the headlines ? 
 I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 He got arrested all right . 
 Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . 
 That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 
 Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves . 
 He's giving lectures on business at colleges . 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 
 So what did you do ? 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 

You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 
 Do you know Chinese better now ? 
 Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . 
 A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . 
 Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . 

So do you believe in palmistry ? 
 It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . 
 Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 
 Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... 
 Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... 
 You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . 
 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! 
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 That's better . 
 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
 It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . 
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . 
 She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . 
 My feelings exactly . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You are absolutely right . 
 That's exactly the way I feel . 
 No , have they have another fight ? 
 You must be joking.Those two . 
 So when did this happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 
 I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . 

What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . 
 You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 
 What'd he do ? 

Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to living . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 
 Why not ? 
 When poyou have to see her ? 

You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 

I think modern painting means nothing . 
 Then why are so many crazy about it 
 Maybe . 
 No , what ? 
 You're kidding . 
 I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years . 
 Well.Good for him . 
 I don't believe it . 
 You are not serious ? 
 I can believe that . 
 I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . 
 I can tell form the way he spoke to us . 

Suit wrote me a letter . 
 She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . 
 It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student . 

Do you think they two will get married ? 
 I think so.Yes , they get along so well . 
 You're right . He sure is . 
 I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . 
 Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ? 
 No problem . 
 Of course , easy.No sweat . 
 Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . 
 Yeah , what't the bet ? 

They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday . 
 I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . 
 But your health is more important . Believe me ! 
 Well , thanks all the same , Denise . But no I don't think.Sorry , I'm sure you would enjoy it . I'd like to Denise , but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too . 
 Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too . 
 Yes . some other time perhaps.Thanks again . 
 Why ? 
 I see . 

I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 Thank you . 
 He is fine . 
 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . 
 Hi , Mary . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . 
 Right . I ’ ll see you later . 

David , I ’ m going to China . 
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
 I ’ m sure I will . 
 Thank you , David . 
 Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
 Congratulations ! 
 I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . 
 I see . 
 Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? 
 Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . 

Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? 
 How are you these days ? 
 Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 

Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . 
 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 

Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? 
 May I introduce myself ? 
 I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . 
 Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you for your concern . 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . 
 But I have an appointment with Ann . 

I can ’ t decide what to do today . 
 Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? 

Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? 
 How old is she ? 
 She is tall ? 
 And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? 

I ’ Ve got a new boss . 
 Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . 
 And a white sports car . 
 Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . 
 Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 How old is he ? 
 Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? 

Is this your new teacher ? 
 Is she short ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 And how old is she ? 

Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? 
 Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 
 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 
 Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . 

You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 

What are you grinning about ? 
 I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . 
 All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? 
 What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . 

My mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day.My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps.My father is very much completely opposite that.He is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , I think in real life , and she is very nice . 
 I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well . 
 I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . 
 I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . 
 Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . 
 I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . 
 What does she like to do ? 
 Sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes . 
 Have you thought about going in Dutch ? 
 Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . 

Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 

How many languages can you speak ? 
 How well can you speak them ? 
 Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? 

Can you speak English ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 What else can you speak ? 

You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . 
 I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . 
 Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . 
 Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? 
 What note ? I can't see . I just pulled an all-nighter . 
 And ? What does it say ? Isn't there a name ? 

Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 

What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . 
 Again ? 
 Ouch . 

Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . 
 I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . 
 It isn't Elvin . 
 Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . 
 Not cash . But if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . 
 I don't have to worry about rent . I live right here . 
 Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home . 
 I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek . 
 Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do . 

Hey , Zina . You're here early today . 
 I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . 
 Fair enough.Keep up the good work . 
 Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her . 
 She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight . 
 You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves . 

Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million . 
 What if I said no ? 
 You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing . 
 OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . 
 She means business , for sure . 
 We'd better get back to work . 

It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . 
 It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . 
 Do you think we'll make it ? 

Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? 
 I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ? 
 A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . 
 As long as it doesn't take too long . 
 Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? 
 So what's the problem ? 
 And it's all coming down to the next three weeks . 
 Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ? 

OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? 
 Mm-hm . How long were you there ? 
 Oh , OK . 
 So , did you , did you lose your finger ? 
 Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . 
 Will you be going back to Australia soon ? 

Hello Michael . 
 We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? 
 OK . What are the biggest cities ? 
 OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? 
 Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? 

Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . 
 Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! 
 Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . 
 Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl 
 There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . 
 Well , thank you . 
 Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . 
 Do ya ? 
 It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . 

Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! 
 Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason . 
 Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! 
 The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . 
 Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . 
 I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . 

So will you come to work with us ? 
 We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility . 
 Don't push your luck , Dave . 
 As soon as you can get here . We'll be waiting for you . 
 and what if it doesn't work out , right ? 
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? 
 Because I won't let it fail . 

Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? 
 Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? 
 I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . 
 Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . 
 For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . 
 That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . 
 Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . 
 Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . 
 Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! 
 Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . 
 Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . 
 Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? 
 That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . 
 And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? 
 Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . 
 Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? 
 Can't Elvin handle it ? 

Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . 
 Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? 
 Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now . 

That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . 
 You can say that again ! 
 They work for Zina now . 
 They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . 
 You do ? 
 No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! 
 No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! 

Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! 
 I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? 
 That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? 

Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . 
 He has no sense . 
 But Joe won't you . 
 I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . 

Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ? 
 He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves . 

My son came home from three years in the navy . 
 Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
 How do you know that ? 
 Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . 
 Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . 
 Good idea . 
 A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... 
 Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . 
 She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . 
 Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . 
 Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? 
 OK . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . 
 We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . 

John dates her seven times a week . 
 I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . 

How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? 
 Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . 
 Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . 
 Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? 
 But you didn't eat anything today . 
 All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . 
 No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . 
 Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . 

Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . 
 I feel sorry for her . 

How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? 
 Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .

Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? 
 Me too . We haven't seen each other for years . 
 How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl . 
 Couldn't be better . 
 She's been good . She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school . And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . 
 All right , Sis ! 
 I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . 
 Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . 
 I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . 
 By the way , what's your favorite weather ? 
 Look , is that Tom ? 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 

Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 

Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 

John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . 
 All right . Are you married ? 
 Then , when do you plan to get married ? 

It's too hot to read . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 How about summer ? 
 Why ? 
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . 
 You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . 
 You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 

Good afternoon . 
 Thank you . 
 It ’ s half past twelve . 
 From one to two . 
 We usually go to the cafeteria . 
 let ’ s go together . 
 Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there . 
 I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . 
 I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . 
 That ’ s my wish . 
 My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? 
 Whose house warming party is it ? 
 Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . 
 Have you seen the house ? 
 Is it nice ? 
 Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? 
 When are they going to have the party ? 
 Wow , that would be something to look forward to . 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . Is that so important ? 
 Yes , I have a three-year-old son . 
 No . It's all Greek to me . 
 I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . 
 I wish you the best of luck . 
 Yes , we are . 
 In the spring . 
 Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
 Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in . 
 Yeah , this is my first visit here . 
 Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . 
 On and off , for quite a few years . 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 At school . And I'm still learning it now . 
 About three years . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 I'm from Germany . 
 Yeah , but I can speak English , too . 
 A little French . 

Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? 
 Do you mean you got a divorce ? 

It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 

It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 

Good afternoon ! 
 I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? 
 Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . 
 What's the weather like in your country ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Here.Near this school . 
 Thanks.Miss Zhang . 
 Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweet , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 

Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 
 I only paid two dollars for mine . 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 Fine ! How are you ? 
 I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
 It will be held at the Music Hall . 
 It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Yes , is that you , Allen ? 
 Not bad . 
 Sure.Thank you very much . 
 Ok , see you . 

How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? 
 Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . 
 You yourself have a photo studio ? 

I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? 
 Who was the conductor ? 
 Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . 
 Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 

Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? 
 I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . 
 Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! 
 Why ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . 
 Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . 
 Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . 
 Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . 
 Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . 
 In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . 
 Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . 
 Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . 
 I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . 
 You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . 
 The weatherman predicts a fine day today . 

Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 
 A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . 
 No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . 
 Is he really ? 
 Who is he marring ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 

When ’ re you getting married ? 
 Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? 
 That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? 
 Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . 
 August 1st . 
 Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . 
 We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . 
 Well , I don't know . 
 So the " Happy Birthday " song has been popular since then ? 

How old are you ? 
 I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . 
 Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
 Certainly . 
 I often play badminton with my parents . 
 Hey , I'm good at playing it . 
 My parents . 
 How about you , Daniel ? 
 Well , who is your favorite football player ? 

Who's singing in your home , Jim ? 
 Who's Ellie ? 
 Oh , I see.how old is she ? 
 I suppose they're playing games . 
 Today . 
 Yes . 
 Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? 
 About 6 . 

Honey , do you know what color the carrot is ? 
 Wow , my son is so clever . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , my son looks like a grown-up . 
 No kidding . So tell me what's your favorite color ? 
 Why ? 
 OK , superman . Put on your cape , we are going to fly home . 
 So , please ! 
 I bought you a new one last year . Isn't it handsome ? 
 Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you . 
 Why hasn't the bus come yet ? Every morning we have to wait for so long . 
 Really ? I am looking forward to that . What about the traffic ? 

Excuse me . Is there any body here ? 
 I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . 
 Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? 
 I'm a back-packer from America . 
 It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . 
 Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . 
 You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . 

You look great ! 
 So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . 
 What's that ? 
 It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? 
 More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? 
 Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . 
 Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . 
 Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . 
 Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . 
 It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . 
 Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? 
 I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . 
 I love running . Anything else ? 
 I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . 
 Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . 
 I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . 
 I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . 
 Don't pull my leg . 
 Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . 
 I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . 
 Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . 
 Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . 

Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . 
 Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? 
 Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . 
 If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . 
 I just want to remind you to behave yourself . 

Come back . You haven't paid yet . 
 But he took some newspaper away without paying . 
 Why ? You make me confused . 
 Why does he have such a privilege ? 
 I see . Does he live by himself ? 
 He must be lonely ? 
 How respectable ! 
 Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch . 
 Did it scare you ? 
 Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . 
 I like scary movies . 
 Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you . 
 Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 Yes . What a good job we have done ! 
 Many customers didn't want them . 
 Good idea . 
 I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . 
 But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . 
 Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . 

What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . 
 Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . 
 It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . 
 Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? 
 Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . 
 I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . 
 Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . 
 Not well enough , but I'm learning . 
 Don't be scared.Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . 

He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . 
 He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . 

Do you know Sally ? 
 Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . 

Why did Tom quit the job ? 
 If he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . 
 It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . 
 But anyway , I'll have a try . 
 He used to be a policeman . 
 Yeah . He's a private eye now . 
 You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . 
 I hope I will meet her soon . 
 I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . 
 Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . 
 Why doesn't he ask her ? 
 He's a chicken guy . 
 Don't you know they've already broken up ? 
 And he's so handsome . 
 If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . 
 She'd better keep away from them . 
 I really couldn't understand him . 
 We'd better leave him alone . 
 I am always on the look out for such girls . 
 Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . 
 Yes , she does . She works at home . 
 Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . 

I decided to go for this kind of life . 
 I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 

We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . 
 Why not ? 

May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . 
 You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . 
 The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . 
 But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . 
 Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . 
 Give me a break . It's not funny . 
 Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . 
 Why ? 
 It's July 7th . Chinese Valentine's Day ! 
 I thought you had trouble with Clive ! 
 Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too . 
 Wow ! Good timing . 
 Come on . Two is company . 
 It's Valentine's Day . Come on . Just go . 
 Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? 
 They have moved to some other places long time ago . 
 Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . 
 Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . 
 Is that better now ? 

Who is that guy ? 
 Really ? He is my type . 
 What position does he play ? 
 Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . 
 Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . 
 Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . 
 By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? 
 Oh , My chance is slim then . 
 So no more regret now ? 
 Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . 
 It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . 
 Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! 
 Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . 
 Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . 
 Good that he resembled his old , quick self . 
 Gee ! You scared me ! 
 Yes , Ma'am . No magazines during the office hours . I'm sorry . 
 It is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me . 
 Aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ... 
 Stretching exercise after sitting a long time . 
 Can I have my magazine back now ? 

Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? 
 Well , we shall make it a secret between us . 
 She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . 
 I want to be like her . 
 Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . 
 Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? 
 Are you out of your mind ? 
 Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . 
 Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . 
 Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! 
 But running so fast is not good for people over forties . 
 We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . 
 In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . 

Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . 
 Of course not ! 
 The pain is killing me . 
 I thought leather shoes will do just as well . 
 What are you going to do ? 
 God ! It's freezing ! 

Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? 
 I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? 
 I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? 
 All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? 
 I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . 
 Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? 
 I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? 
 No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . 

Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? 
 Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . 
 We should choose from the backups . 
 That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . 
 Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? 
 Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . 
 Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . 
 Yeah , what ’ s up ? 
 I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . 
 Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! 
 Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . 
 Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . 
 Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . 
 Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . 
 Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . 
 That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . 
 To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . 
 Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? 
 Who plays who ? 
 It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? 
 I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . 
 I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . 
 That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . 
 You are always so naughty . 
 Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . 
 We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . 
 Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . 
 Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . 
 Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . 
 OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . 
 Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? 
 I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . 
 I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . 
 OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? 
 That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . 
 Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . 
 Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . 
 I've said you will enjoy your life here ! 
 Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . 
 That's good ! 
 Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . 
 He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . 
 OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! 
 Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . 
 You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! 
 Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . 
 Please come in . 
 I really appreciate it . 
 I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . 
 Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? 
 That's terrific ! 
 Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . 
 Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . 
 Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . 
 That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . 
 My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . 
 Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . 
 He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . 

Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . 
 No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? 
 All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . 
 No , before the In dynasty . 
 Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . 
 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 
 That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . 
 When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . 
 Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . 
 Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . 

Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? 
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 
 Is there anything interesting ? 
 I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? 
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 
 I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? 

Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday . 
 Why ? Do you know that guy ? 
 That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks . 
 Wow . That's wonderful . 
 Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . 
 Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . 
 You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . 
 I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . 

May , is the university a terrible place ? 
 Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . 
 How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . 
 Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? 
 What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? 
 I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . 
 You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . 

Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name . 
 What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there . 
 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 
 Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it . 
 Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth . 
 There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ? 

Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . 
 I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? 
 OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . 
 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . 
 I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . 
 Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs 

May , look , what's that in the cage ? 
 Of course I know . I just can't see it very well . 
 Of course , Bamboo ! 
 I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship . 
 Not really , panda is my favorite animal . 
 Any way , in a word , panda is our friend . 
 Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous . 

Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? 
 Yes , of course . 
 There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . 
 There , you only have two ways for visiting . 
 On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . 
 Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . 
 Yes . 
 Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . 
 Is it horror movie ? 
 No way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . 
 Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 The Terminal is a movie of this type . 
 Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it . 
 May and Danny have already grown up . 
 Look at that big tree over there . 
 Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight . 
 But you agreed to go out with me at last . 

Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty . 
 Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie . 
 Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get . 
 You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable ! 
 Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . 
 Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? 

Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ? 
 Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? 
 Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . 
 What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities . 
 Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . 
 Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? 
 This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . 
 And ? 
 Poor child ! 
 Of course , they are out there . 
 Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . 
 That's right . I can see them in my dreams . 
 No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . 
 OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . 
 Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . 

Nice weather , honey ! 
 May and Daniel often like this kind of weather . 
 Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ? 
 Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time . 
 Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot . 
 Daniel loves the beach very much ! 

What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? 
 Don't believe him . He's liar . 

Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? 
 OK . 
 Yeah , some places are very short of water . 
 You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . 

I heard that Ann had divorced . 
 Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . 

What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? 
 I don't think so . He only had no common sense . 
 It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . 
 That give us a good lesson . 
 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
 It's too late . 
 Are you sure of that ? 
 They may have some difficulty in doing it . 
 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 
 Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . 
 This situation isn't easy to handle . 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 
 John is in prison now . He was copped outstealing . 

You know that ? Dan got a divorce . 
 Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife . 

What will you do now ? Propose to her . 
 You should strike while the iron is hot . 

Does Tom drink a lot ? 
 That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . 
 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
 Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . 
 Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Yeah . 
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
 Partly , and he's also a hard working man . 
 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . 
 I went to Paris . 
 He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
 So are Copernicus and many others . 
 I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . 
 Thank you . 
 Because it was her husband who beat her . 
 She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . 
 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
 I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . 

Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . 
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? 
 He is then in a very difficult situation . 

Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . 
 No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . 
 You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock . 
 Thanks for telling me this . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again . 

Merry Christmas ! 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 

Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? 
 Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? 
 And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . 
 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . 
 I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
 I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . 
 Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . 
 That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . 
 Yes . 
 We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . 
 Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . 
 He is more nice than wise . 
 Ask me a question ? What do you want to know ? 
 Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know . 
 Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ? 

Where are you going ? 
 What's wrong with her . 
 Congratulations to you . 

You want to go with him ? 
 Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . 
 She is now in a private school . 
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 

A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . 
 He must be regretting about having done the business . 

Is this watch yours ? 
 Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . 

This small town has many serious problems . 
 The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 

I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 

You look pale , you must have poor health . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 

Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 
 Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . 

Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ? 
 Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . 

Where is Tom ? 
 What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . 
 Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . 
 So the reform can not be carried out well . 
 Easier said than done . 
 Joe ? I don't know what you mean . 
 Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . 

John hasn't got married up to now . 
 Really ? Does Mary know that ? 
 How silly John is . 
 I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . 
 Oh , without a doubt . When is the next class ? 
 No problem . 
 Of course , easy . No sweat . 
 Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . 
 Yeah , what't the bet ? 

Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
 You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
 So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 

Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? 
 How do you find the prices there ? 
 I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? 

You're from New York , aren't you ? 
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
 No , I don't like museums . They're boring . 
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 
 How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent . 
 It's Nugent , N-U-G-E-N-T , but just call me Ted . 
 Glad to meet you . 
 Me ? I'm in the car business . 
 Yes , that's right . And how about you ? 
 Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ? 

You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? 
 With the job ? 
 A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . 

When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does 6 thirty suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 

What's the date today Mr.Brown ? I don't have a calendar . 
 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . 
 It is at 8 o'clock . 
 I don't know what time it is . 
 I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 

Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 

That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . 
 I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? 
 I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . 
 Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . 
 I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . 
 That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? 
 That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? 

You know John ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . 
 I wish he could too . 
 He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . 
 Good luck to them . 
 I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . 
 I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . 
 Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . 
 That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . 
 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . 
 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . 
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . 
 It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? 
 Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . 
 You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . 
 Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . 
 I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . 
 Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . 
 That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
 Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . 
 Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? 
 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . 
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . 
 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
 It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . 
 I just don ’ t find it very interesting . 
 I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . 
 I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . 
 Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . 

When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . 
 I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! 
 No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . 
 I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? 
 Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . 
 Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . 
 We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . 
 The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . 
 A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . 
 Was he disqualified ? 

I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . 
 The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . 
 Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . 
 Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? 
 What a good idea ! 
 I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . 
 No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . 
 I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . 
 The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . 

Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? 
 Is it really completely flat ? 
 Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . 
 We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . 
 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . 
 What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . 
 That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . 
 I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . 
 Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . 
 Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . 
 Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . 
 Is that type of plant found in this country ? 
 So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ? 
 That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . 
 I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . 
 That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 
 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
 Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect . 

Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? 
 First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . 
 How do you research your books ? 
 I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! 
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? 
 Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . 
 I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . 
 no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? 
 isn ’ t it really cold there ? 
 I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . 
 We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . 
 It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . 
 We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . 
 It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . 
 Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . 

Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! 
 Where have you been ? 
 How was your flight ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? 
 Did you have a layover ? 
 Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? 
 Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... 

What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? 
 In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? 
 I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? 
 There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? 
 The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? 
 Ok . 
 Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . 
 I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . 
 Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . 
 I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! 
 No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . 
 Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . 
 I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . 
 If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . 
 I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . 
 I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . 
 That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . 
 Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . 
 The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . 
 I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good . 
 It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . 

Is your city a historical place ? 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 
 As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 
 Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . 
 I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . 
 I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . 
 I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . 
 Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . 
 We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . 
 Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . 
 That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . 
 Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual . 
 Yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along . 

I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ? 
 I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . 
 I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . 
 You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . 

You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? 
 How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? 
 I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . 
 Are you a member of his fan club ? 
 Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? 
 Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? 
 I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . 
 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
 Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . 
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . 

Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . 
 I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . 
 When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? 
 When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . 
 That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . 
 Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . 

I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . 
 I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . 
 no-one really believes gossip columnists . 
 I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . 
 I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . 
 Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . 
 Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . 
 This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
 I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
 It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? 
 Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . 
 I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . 
 How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . 
 Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . 
 I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . 

How often do you use the internet ? 
 Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . 
 Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . 
 I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . 
 What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . 
 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . 
 The problem is that many poor people might suffer . 
 would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . 
 I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . 
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . 
 You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
 Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ? 
 I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
 I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
 Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . 

I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! 
 But it ’ s so old . 
 No , not at all . 
 I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? 
 Why does he want to do that ? 
 Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? 
 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 
 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
 It would take a lot less time ... 
 Ok . That sounds like a deal . 
 I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . 
 If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . 
 Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . 
 It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . 
 They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . 
 Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . 
 That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . 
 Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . 
 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . 
 Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres ! 
 I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from . We got on very well and I hope to work with her again . I enjoyed making the movie very much . 
 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
 I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . 
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 

Which language do you speak ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . 
 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 

Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? 
 Who ’ s it about ? 
 Who is he ? 
 Who ’ s the author ? 
 What do you think about it ? 
 Can I read it when you ’ re done ? 
 How many chapters does the book have ? 
 When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? 
 Thanks . Charlie ! 

Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . 
 It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . 
 What did the critic say ? 
 The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . 
 I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . 
 It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . 
 Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . 
 The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
 Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . 

Are you an art aficionado ? 
 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . 
 Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . 
 I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . 
 Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . 
 As you know , China has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? 
 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 
 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 I've been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 
 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . 
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . 

The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . 
 I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 
 I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 
 This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! 
 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . 
 What ’ s special about a thai massage ? 
 Sounds painful ! 
 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 
 I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! 
 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 
 I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . 
 Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . 
 They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . 
 Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . 
 Yes , she gets along with them quite well . 
 Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . 
 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 
 That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . 
 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . 
 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . 
 Of course . What do you want to move first ? 

Do you like Barry ? 
 I agree . I like his brother , Paul . They are not alike . 
 What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don ’ t think you ’ re shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You ’ re right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 He ’ s 21 . how old is James ? 
 How ’ s your father ? 
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 
 In the same way , probably . 
 I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . 
 No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . 
 Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . 
 Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? 
 Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . 
 Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . 

I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 What airline and what flight ? 
 I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m . 

That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? 
 I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . 
 Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? 
 We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself . 
 No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? 
 I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . 
 I ’ m a doctor . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 
 Oh , do you enjoy it ? 

What does she do ? 
 Does she go to night school ? 
 Why ? What does she want to be ? 
 What classes does she take ? 

Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? 
 Do you go to work by train every day ? 
 And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Which train do you catch in the evening ? 
 And can you get a seat ? 
 Would you agree that the service is fast ? 

Morning , Bob . Fancy meeting you here ! 
 Well , I thought I'd come to see you , so here I am . 
 Fine , just fine . And you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Take care of yourself . 
 Sounds wonderful . When shall we make it ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 Fine . 
 Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . 
 He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 

Good evening . Welcome to our program . 
 Would you tell us your name , please ? 
 Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . 
 Where are you from , Ms.Baker ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Thank you for coming , Ms.baker . 
 Good morning , Miss Bell ! 
 Nice to see you too . It's been a long time . 
 Just fine , and you ? 
 Did you drive yourself to the airport ? 
 Did someone meet you at the airport here ? 
 Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? 

London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . 
 Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . 
 She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . 
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . 
 Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! 
 Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . 
 Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ? 
 You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye . 

Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? 
 I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? 
 Do we have Christmas pudding ? 
 Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person . 
 I hope you didn ’ t forget mine ! 
 Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? 
 Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? 
 That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet . 
 I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . 

How do you celebrate national day in your country ? 
 What kinds of parades are there ? 
 We don ’ t have a national day . 
 I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t . 

What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? 
 There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . 
 I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? 
 I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . 
 Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . 
 They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . 
 Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ? 
 Me , too . What would you like to do ? 
 I have , actually . How about the movie , Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ? 
 We could , but it looks like it ’ s going to rain soon . 
 I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! 
 I don ’ t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ? 
 Let ’ s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? 
 Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ? 
 Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ? 
 No , but I could take the bus . 
 That sounds great ! Have you eaten ? 
 Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ? 
 Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose ! 
 See you soon . 

Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? 
 Were you celebrating something ? 
 It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . 
 I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . 
 Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? 
 Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . 
 Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... 
 Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . 
 The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . 
 That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . 

I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . 
 I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? 
 What do you think our chance are in other events . 
 We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . 
 You are very optimistic ! 
 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 I can speak French and German . 
 I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . 
 No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 But everything has been so easy . 
 Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . 

Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to living . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 

I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . 
 Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . 
 Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 

Have you heard of Paul ? 
 He's got a promotion . 
 No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . 
 Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . 

Have you heard about Anlesen David ? 
 No , they got engaged . 
 Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . 
 Next June . 

Are you sure this is the right restaurant 。 
 You don't think you could be wrong ? 
 I don't know . It looks a little wrong down . 
 You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? 

You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? 
 I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . 
 I don ’ t believe that . 
 I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? 
 That ’ s your opinion not mine . 
 Yes . I dare say it will be . 
 No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
 Mmm , you may be right . 
 No . We couldn ’ t possibly . 
 It will be summer . So it will be hot . 
 Yes . It could happen . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I think the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Really ? 
 By air of course . 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 

Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Is that so ? 

Hi , how ’ re you doing ? 
 Oh , what ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? 
 Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . 
 Well , you ’ d better get some rest . 
 Bye . 
 What is it ? 
 Do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own ? 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee . 
 Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? 
 You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... 
 My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . 
 I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . 

How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . 
 I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . 
 Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? 
 Did they have lobster ? 
 Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . 
 When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? 
 Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? 

I ’ Ve just take out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary . 
 I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . 
 That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . 
 Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . The insurance company need to assess the risk . 
 Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? 
 Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . 
 You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? 
 Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . 

Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . 
 I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . 
 There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . 
 I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes ! 
 I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before . 
 I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . 
 I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere . If I ’ m staying at home , I don ’ t shave . 
 Yes . I brush my teeth in the morning , just before I go to work . It ’ s actually the last thing I do before leaving . Then I brush again before bed . 

So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . 
 That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 
 So , what did you get them ? 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . 

I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . 
 He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . 
 Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . 
 Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . 
 No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . 

Are you going to Helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? 
 If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go , so I think it should be ok ? 
 I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . 
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 
 Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at Helen ’ s . 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? 

My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! 
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? 
 Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! 
 Well . How do you know ? 
 My father failed in business . 
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . 
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . 
 Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . 
 Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . 
 I wouldn't do it if I were you . 
 It's very dangerous , you know . 
 It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . 
 Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . 
 Thank you for your warning . 
 Be careful of yourself . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 

John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? 
 It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . 

When were you Bron may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am frigid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 See you . 
 Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today . 
 You knew Brain Locker ? 
 Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses . 

My friend Jane is very beautiful . 
 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . 
 Dark blue . 
 Twenty . 
 What's her last name ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 How old is she ? 

Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? 
 Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . 
 You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . 
 Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . 
 I am not surprised , you eat too much . 
 No , I wouldn't think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on the diet ? 
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 

What did you think of the film ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . 
 Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 Well , I swim and run every day . 
 Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . 
 Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . 
 Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 

Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . 
 About 7 o'clock . 
 No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . 
 Really ? There aren't many left now . 
 Were there any animals in the forest ? 

The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? 
 We met them in Bermuda last May . 
 The couple with the dogs-think back . 
 Well , I've invited them for brunch . 

What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by " us " ? 
 What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? 
 Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? 

I went to the doctor yesterday . 
 I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
 He said I ' d got the flu . 
 He told me to stay in bed for ten days . 
 Yes , ten days . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Of course . Suit yourself . 
 Hi , I'm Susan Jackson . 
 I'm a student at UCLA . 
 Medicine . 
 Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ? 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ? 

What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ? 
 Will you say it again ? 

Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? 
 Do you put your feet on your own table ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , will you please put them down ? 
 I forgot something on the table . 

Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 

What's your favorite book ? 
 Why do you like it best ? 
 Well . I like the Thom Birds best . 
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 

What's that book you have under your arm ? 
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 
 If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . 
 Not a great deal . 
 For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . 

Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 

I ’ Ve got a new boss . 
 Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . 
 And a white sports car . 
 Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . 
 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . 
 It's the end of the world for me . 
 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . 
 I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me . 
 I hope so . 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That ’ s sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , she ’ s average . 
 They ’ re dark gray . 
 It ’ s blond . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Of course . I often go to the movies . 
 I heard it ’ s a very good movie . 
 Let ’ s look at the newspaper . 
 Wonderful . I ’ m so excited . 
 Um ? 
 As you like . 
 It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . 
 Leave me alone . 
 No thanks . I have had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 

How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! 
 Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . 

Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . 
 I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
 Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? 
 That is truly amazing ! 
 Me too . I like the festival best of all . 
 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . 
 Such as ? 
 Why ? To welcome the new year of course ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels . 
 Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . 
 Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 You did ? that is great ! 
 No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? 
 Ok , great , should I bring anything ? 
 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 
 Got it . 
 Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem many hurry ! 
 Don't worry , I'll drive you . 
 How are your cases coming along ? 
 Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the red of building ? 
 You're welcome . Good luck , bye ! 

Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . 
 What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . 
 Really ? What ’ s the catch ? 
 So what does this plan include ? 
 Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? 

Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? 
 Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . 

Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . 
 Let me show you the way . Please follow me . 
 My pleasure . 
 It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . 
 Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? 
 Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before ! 
 Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! 
 Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . 
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 
 Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! 
 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . 
 I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! 
 Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ? 
 Ah ... hence the buns and condiments we bought . And this is Holly's potato salad . 
 Let me know if I can help . 
 You're right . We're not really into used stuff . 
 There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . 
 Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! 
 Eh , so so . 
 Nah , not too flashy . 
 I guess . 
 And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! 
 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 

Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes I do . How about you ? 
 You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? 
 Uh huh ... 
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 
 What was that ? 
 And that ? 
 What was that ? 
 You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! 
 Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . 
 No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! 
 Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? 

Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! 
 If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! 
 It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! 
 She will insist . It's a rosary . She has millions of them . Take it . 
 Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” 
 She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly . 
 Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . 
 That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . 
 No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! 
 I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . 
 That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . 
 Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . 
 Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . 
 Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . 
 Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . 

Harry , do you like the opera ? 
 Why is that ? It is called real art . 
 Yeah , that makes sense . 
 We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . 
 Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . 
 I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... 
 What kind of girl is she ? 
 Is her fiance Taiwanese ? 
 How old is he ? 

Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? 
 Is rice your staple food , too ? 

Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited ! 
 You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! 
 Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! 
 No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! 
 Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too ! 

Hey , guys ! 
 How's business ? 
 Wow ! I'm impressed ! 
 I quit my job as a food critic . 

Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S .. 
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 

What's going on here ? 
 Master Li ? Who's that ? 
 I will ! I could use some good luck ! 
 Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band . 
 Stop making fun of me . 
 I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring ! 

Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . 
 She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . 
 Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? 

I'd love that . I'm so glad I quit . It's time for a change . 
 Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef . 
 I'm sure you have great connections . 
 Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ? 
 He's prejudiced , isn't he ? 
 Ah ! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food ! 
 You'll see next week . I'll come by one day at lunchtime . 
 Oh , I can't . I have a date ! 
 This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . 
 Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . 
 It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . 

Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . 
 You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? 
 Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! 
 What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! 
 Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies . 
 Of course I'm pale . It's just now the beginning of spring . I don't have my summer tan yet . 
 I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun .. 
 Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . 
 But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . 

I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? 
 Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . 
 I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? 

Balista , pull me a ristretto . 
 It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . 
 You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? 
 Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . 
 Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? 
 The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 
 That's a notebook ? 
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 
 What ? 
 Cool ! I wish I could have been there ! 
 Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die . 
 Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . 
 Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them . 
 Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way . 
 Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
 Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! 
 You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? 
 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 
 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 

Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! 
 And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 And they said you should play classical music ? 

Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 What research ? 
 But they're just ads ... 

These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? 
 That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . 
 Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . 

Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with . 
 Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! 
 It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . 
 And it says that it sleeps . 
 Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover . 
 Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . 
 I guess I'm lending them to you ... 
 She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . 
 Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? 
 Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! 
 To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . 
 Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . 
 Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . 
 I used to date him . Of course it was him . 
 Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . 
 But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has " cancer patient " written all over his face . 
 And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that . 
 Sounds good . What do we need to bring ? 
 I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . 
 Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out . 
 You're like the tenth person to say that . 
 Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! 
 Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . 
 Maybe ... 
 Is that a kind of alcohol ? 
 Great . My face will turn even redder ! 
 Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . 
 I'll take over for a while to give you a break . 
 Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! 
 I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? 
 Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? 
 No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . 
 I'm not really into racecar driving . 
 Yeah , well , times change . Look at you-you're a father now . You can't say that you haven't changed . 
 I mean , I know spring training's over , but I'm just not into all that . 

Hey , the pool's open now ! 
 So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... 
 Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . 

OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! 
 They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! 
 Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... 

OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . 
 Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . 
 The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! 

Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . 
 Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . 
 Why ? Did you open an attachment ? 
 I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . 
 Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! 
 No . What did it say ? 
 A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? 
 I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! 
 Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? 
 C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . 
 There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . 

What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . 
 Such a thing exists ? 
 Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . 

He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? 
 As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . 
 Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? 
 Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? 
 This show is like a black Friends . 
 That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable . 
 It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . 
 Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . 
 Ha-ha ! You got me there ! 
 Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . 
 Those clothes do suit him better . 
 Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ? 
 He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . 
 You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” 

What have you been up to , Johnny ? 
 Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? 
 You have all the fun , don't you ? 
 Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! 
 Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . 
 Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . 
 Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! 
 Oh , don't mention it . 
 Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . 
 Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . 
 Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts 
 Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! 
 Umm . . . That's the spirit ! 
 Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . 
 No , tell me more . 
 And . 
 That's great news , Jeremy . Congratulations ! Anyway , I must get back , but give my regards to your wife Monica . 

Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . 
 Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . 
 Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” 
 Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” 
 Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . 
 Nice ! Let ' s go ! 
 Sure ! What ' s playing ? 
 Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . 
 I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 
 Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! 
 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
 I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . 

Are you excited about your trip next month ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . 
 I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . 
 Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . 

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 
 Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . 
 Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! 
 The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? 

Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 
 January 5th . 
 That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 

Let ’ s play a game ! 
 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 
 Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! 
 Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! 
 Not funny . 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . 
 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . 
 This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . 
 Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! 
 Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . 
 Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . 
 That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian . 
 I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . 
 I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 

Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . 
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 
 And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . 
 What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! 

Trina , will you marry me ? 
 Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . 
 She what ? 
 Four hundred ? 
 Ah ... 
 Wow . 
 If I survive the next six months . 
 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . 
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 
 Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... 
 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? 
 Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . 

Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 
 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . 
 But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 
 I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? 
 It ’ s about time ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . 
 Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . 
 That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! 
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 

I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 
 Well , that seems easy enough . 
 Geez . Is that all ? 
 Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! 
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
 I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! 
 That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! 
 I ’ Ve been playing computer games . 
 It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
 My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . 
 Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . 

Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! 
 I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . 
 Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . 
 Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! 

Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! 
 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
 I know . I know ! 
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! 

Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . 
 So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? 
 Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! 

Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? 
 I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . 
 Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? 
 Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! 

Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
 Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . 
 Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? 
 So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? 
 If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? 

Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . 
 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . 
 What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . 
 Yeah , yeah , whatever . 
 I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . 
 I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . 
 That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . 
 Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! 
 I can't sleep ... 
 Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . 
 Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! 
 Really ? 
 O-K ... 

Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months ! 
 Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! 
 Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . 

Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! 
 Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . 
 Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . 
 I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? 
 Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? 
 Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
 Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . 
 Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . 
 Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? 
 I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . 

Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? 
 I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? 
 Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . 
 I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . 
 Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! 
 Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? 
 And then what did happen ? 
 Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! 
 Count me in ! 
 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . 
 I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 
 Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? 
 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 
 Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . 
 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . 
 You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! 
 Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . 
 I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . 
 Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . 
 As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . 
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
 Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? 
 Yes , I ’ m a singer . 
 Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? 
 Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . 
 Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . 
 Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . 
 Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! 

Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ? 
 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 

Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . 
 Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . 
 I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . 
 Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . 
 Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 

Honey , do you have a second ? 
 We need to talk . 
 I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . 
 That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! 
 Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . 
 I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . 
 Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . 
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 
 I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . 
 Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? 

Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 
 No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . 
 No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . 
 In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . 
 Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . 
 Well , as we say , the rest is history ... 
 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 
 If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! 
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 

What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . 
 I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . 
 A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
 Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . 
 There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! 
 Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? 
 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 From China . 
 It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . 
 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? 
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 
 Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! 
 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 
 Yeah . I know . 
 You know , I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Honey ... 
 Baby , I love you so much . 
 I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Come on . Put the gun down . 

Mike ! What's going on , man ! Long time no see ! 
 Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well . 
 He ’ s doing well . We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened . 
 Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ... 
 Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! 
 Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . 
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 
 What an amazing goal ! 
 Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! 
 Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! 
 He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
 Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
 But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . 
 That would be great ! Give me a call ! 

I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! 
 Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? 
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? 
 Hold on a sec , his name is David ? 
 That ’ s my brother ! 
 And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? 
 I ’ Ve heard this one before . 
 Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . 

Has the game started yet ? 
 Who's winning ? 
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! 
 You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! 
 Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! 
 Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 
 Oh , hey ... 
 Actually , my office is right around the corner . 
 Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . 
 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 

Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . 
 Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . 
 But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 
 Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . 
 Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! 
 Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? 
 I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . 
 Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? 
 Yes . I like it very much . 
 It's excellent . 
 It's delicious . 
 I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? 
 Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . 

Good morning , Mary ! 
 I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? 
 Yes , if that's all right for you . 
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . 

I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . 
 I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . 
 No , thank you . 
 It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . 
 When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . 
 I appreciate that , thank you . 
 A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? 
 I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . 
 I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . 
 Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . 
 I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . 
 It will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . 
 I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . 
 Nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing . 
 You know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . 

Something wrong ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Do you want me to take a look ? 
 Well , if you change your mind , let me know . 
 No problem . 
 Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . 
 Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . 

Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . 
 Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . 
 I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? 
 Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . 
 OK . 
 Nothing really , why , what ' s up ? 
 Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? 
 Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . 
 Ok , I will see you then . 

Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? 
 Well , Rose . 
 Are your free this weekend ? 
 Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? 
 I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . 
 Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? 
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 
 I'll be there on time . 
 I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? 
 I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . 
 Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . 
 I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . 
 That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . 

Are you ready to go to the bank ? 
 There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . 
 that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . 
 I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . 

I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well . 
 Now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . 
 You ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ? 
 They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . 
 He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . 
 Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? 
 It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? 
 Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet . 
 You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
 Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? 
 Well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . 
 I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! 

Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . 
 No , I just started working here at IBM , I am assigned sale department . 
 I main market reasearch , and you ? 
 Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ? 
 Thanks , that's would be lovely . You'r right , he is kind and nice looking . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? 
 Yes , I was . You work for 3M , right ? 
 Good . 
 I ’ m a fashion designer . Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets . So you can bring a friend if you like . 
 Thank you . 
 But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 
 Thanks for coming . 
 Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . 
 Good night then . 

Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning . 
 I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . 
 Thank you . 
 Bye . 
 You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? 
 How about I come and see you off ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . 
 Of course . I will . 

What ’ s “ pi ” ? 
 I see . What is that ratio exactly ? 
 It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . 
 According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . 
 What ’ s the next question . 
 I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . 
 Exactly . Anything else ? 
 You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . 
 It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . 
 There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . 
 That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . 
 I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . 

I really should be on my way . 
 No , thank you . I can ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . I had a really good time . 
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . 
 ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . 
 It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . 

Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? 
 It's been a long time ! What's new ? 
 Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . 
 I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . 
 Ok , I won't keep you then . 
 Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! 
 Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . 
 There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . 
 That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . 
 I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . 

Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? 
 How would you solve the problem ? 
 It would probably be very expensive . 
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 
 Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . 
 Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . 
 I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . 
 Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . 
 It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
 I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
 Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . 
 I know . I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm . It was pouring with rain all afternoon . 
 If it was sunning all year round there would be drought . You probably would not like it either . 
 The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . Our weather is so changeable . 
 It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
 Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . 

What are the seasons like in your city ? 
 Does it ever rain in summer ? 
 What are spring and autumn like ? 
 Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot . Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . 
 No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . 

What's the weather like in your city ? 
 The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . The rain falls mostly in the winter . And we often get snow . 
 In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . The streets are often icing in the morning . With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . 
 We do have a few fog days in winter . But I would not say we have a lot of fogs . The sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ? 
 Have you ever had snow in your city ? 
 The river in my city sometime freeze over . People go ice-skating on it . In summer people go boating on the river . But few people go swimming because it is not very clean . 

What book is that ? 
 Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . 
 Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . 
 The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . 
 It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . 
 They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . 
 Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . 
 This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . 
 It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . 
 According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? 

What do you do in summer ? 
 I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . 
 Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . 
 Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! 
 Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! 
 Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . 
 I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . 
 I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . 
 I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time . 
 It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . 
 The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . 
 I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . 

Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? 
 Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . 
 What is the international community doing to help ? 
 How many countries have been affected ? 
 I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran . 
 Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? 

Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? 
 Yes , it is . My country is famous for having that natural resources . We also have a lot of natural gas . 
 No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits . 
 When I traveled around your country , I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams . 
 You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources . 
 I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed . 
 We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . 
 We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China . 
 We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . 
 Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . 
 I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . 
 You ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area . 
 Ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? 
 I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . 
 We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . 
 Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . 
 More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . 
 Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . 
 A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . 

How are the children doing at sport ? 
 He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? 
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? 
 How are they at swimming ? 
 Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . 
 I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . 

hi , Meally , do you know that guy over there ? 
 He is cute . What dose he do ? 
 Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? 

Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . 
 Well , drop by if you can . 
 No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . 
 Sure , When is good time for you ? 
 What time do you want me there ? 
 All right , It's a date . 
 No , but I have to type my paper tonight . 
 You got it ! 
 No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? 
 Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? 

I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . 
 Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting . 

Do you like snakes ? 
 I mean , do you like snake meat ? 

It is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight . 
 Yes . So you'd better dress warmly before you go out . 

I must be going now . 
 No , I really must go now.My family are expecting me home soon . 
 See you ! 
 Coffee , please . 
 Coke is fine.Thank you . 
 I like orange better . 
 Because orange is much more to my taste . 
 I'm not sure . 
 OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . 
 How nice of you to remember ! 
 You're so thoughtful.Thank you . 
 The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day ! 
 Don't be silly . 
 We've a country house . 
 Join us , will you ? 

How about doing shopping this weekend ? 
 Sportshoes.Will you go with me ? 

Paul , let's go and see Grandpa this afternoon . 
 It's Saturday . 

Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ? 
 The radio says it'll be fine . 

I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . 
 You've formed a sound habit . 

I want to have a complete relaxation this weekend . 
 Yes , exactly . 

Will you go with us this Sunday ? 
 Let's go and play volleyball . 

We have a live show of a football match this Friday night . 
 Brazilian against AC Millan . 

Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon . 
 How about a china vase ? 

Is Water Shrinking Festival official ? 
 Don't you think these festivals are more interesting ! 

Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? 
 I see.Did they succeed in the end ? 

Going to the cafeteria ? 
 That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . 

Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? 
 What about historic festivals ? 

What do people usually do on Saint Valentine's Day ? 
 What will the girls do ? 

How many days do you take off for Easter ? 
 What will you do for this Easter ? 

Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? 
 Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
 I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . 
 Not every day , but occasionally . 
 I don't believe ads.What ' s more , I'm already in perfect health . 
 And we're going to have summer vacation . 
 I'll plan for the vacation . 
 Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception 
 I'd better exercise my body too.My limbs are rusty now . 
 Sure , great effect.My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 . 

You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? 
 Aren't you tired ? 

Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . 
 Manchester United . What about you ? 
 I have confidence in them . 
 I didn't wear make-up this morning . 
 You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . 
 What's your trouble ? 
 I got it . 
 So what ? 
 Wow , I like concerts . 
 Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? 
 Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . 
 Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . 
 You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . 

I go to the fitness center every weekend . 
 To lose some weight . 

Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . 
 Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . 
 It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . 
 I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . 
 Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . 
 That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? 
 It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . 
 Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . 
 Sure , I have . Will you join ? 
 You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
 No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . 

Will it be all right to visit you this evening ? 
 It's fine with me . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes , he is . 
 It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ? 
 I've never been better , thanks . 
 Good evening , David.Good evening , Mary.It ' s so good of you both to come . 

Do you mind if we call on you this evening ? 
 How about seven o'clock ? 

Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . 
 No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . 
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 
 Make yourself at home . 
 Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . 
 You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? 
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 
 I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 Thanks . 
 What's the route ? 
 If only I could join it ! 
 Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . 

The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? 
 Certainly . 
 On that day , people play all kinds of tricks on others , and the one easily taken in is called April fool . 
 April the first is coming.Be careful ! 
 No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along . 
 I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow . 
 I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ? 

Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat . 
 No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . 
 Sure.Which one ? 
 Where do you want to sit ? 
 Are these seats all right ? They're in the second rows . 
 Sorry.We ' Ve nothing further back . 
 Thirty yuan . 

It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must . 
 I'm sorry , but I can't . 
 Don't mention it.Don ' t forget to take your daughter along next time . 

It's late.It ' s high time I left.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . 
 Good night then ! 

I really have a good time here.Thank you very much . 
 I promise . 
 Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! 
 Yes , please do . 
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . 

It's getting late . I really have to go . 
 I hope so . A good journey to you ! 

I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 
 I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . 
 Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . 
 OK.Thanks for asking me . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . 
 Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . 
 Of course not , go ahead . 
 Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day . 
 Thank you for your suggestion . 

Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ? 
 Well , when will it be convenient for you ? 

I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
 How about next week ? 

I'm told Cold Blood just finished its last cut . 
 Sure , it'll be on next Monday . 
 Did you get any ? 
 How much is the ticket ? 

Shall we have two tickets for for seven thirty ? 
 In the front , please . 
 That's a good idea.What ' s on ? 
 What's it about ? 

I don't think much of the film . 
 Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense ! 

Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? 
 Wow , you sound very professional . 

When it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? 
 But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 I will think about it . 
 No , it sounds wrong . He was born in the 16th century . 
 1564 . 
 Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . 
 A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . 

Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching . 
 The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you . 
 Simply because it's not practical at all . 
 I'm sorry . I don't think so . 
 It's much too hard for his age . 
 I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other . 

Jane is going to quit her job in the bank . 
 It's true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money . 
 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 
 How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? 

What's up ? You look depressed . 
 Would you rather I taught him a lesson for you ? 

We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? 
 Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . 
 Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones 
 Possibly . 
 I'd prefer to go abroad , if possible . 
 I'm one of them . 
 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . 
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? 
 My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? 

Where would you like to have your dinner ? 
 You don't like Western food ? 

How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? 
 You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? 
 Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . 
 You got a raise ? 
 You got promoted ? 
 You won a lottery ? Don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please . 

Can we go to the beach on foot ? 
 Is the bus station close by ? 

I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . 
 Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . 
 I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . 
 Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . 
 Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . 

He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . 
 Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . 
 I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . 
 Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . 
 I will think about it . 

Japanese is easy to learn . 
 I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese . 

I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 

It's not good for business recently . 
 Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . 
 Well , flying kites is more fun to me . 
 Let's go and buy one . 
 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 
 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . 
 Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . 
 I don't entirely agree with you . 
 Well , that's a thing . 
 Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . 
 Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . 
 Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . 
 That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . 
 But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . 
 Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . 
 Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star . 
 Many ! 
 My choice would always be tea . 
 Last year when I visited China . 
 I'm having a hard time getting the information . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 

Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . 
 I guess we'll see just around . 
 You too . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 

I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . 
 Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . 
 You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . 
 I know , and I will . 
 After baseball practice . 
 No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . 
 No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 Are you in a hurry ? 
 In that case , here , you go first . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 Not really . I could take it or leave it . 
 How can you do that ? 
 I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin . 
 Without doubt , rock is trash . 
 For What ? 
 Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . 
 Yes , he is running for class president . 
 Take my word for it . 
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . 
 I will . See you later . 
 I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance . 
 You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say “ pretty woman ” . 

Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ? 
 How about the Yellow Mountains ? 

Here , Let me get the door for you . 
 Do you need a hand with that ? 
 Don't worry about it . 
 Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . 
 Thank you so much . You're an expert . 
 Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you . 
 Be careful , Tom . Those are pretty heavy . 

Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
 Let's make a bet on who gets it . 

What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? 
 When is your garden at its best ? 

How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? 
 Do you know why that is ? 

Do you mind if I ask you to practice speaking English with me ? 
 Well , I'm meeting some American friends next weekend . 

I'm going on a cruise this summer . 
 My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . 

I don't know whether or not to believe him . 
 But it's really too important to me . 

What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? 
 I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . 
 Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how to goes . 
 Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? 
 Chocolate is mine . 
 I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs . 
 It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need . 
 Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . 
 Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . 
 Yeah . Whatever became of him ? 
 That's great . We should visit him some time . 
 Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? 
 Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . 
 I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . 
 I came to see my aunt . 
 Yes . She lives on the next block . 
 Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? 
 Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . 
 Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . 
 About 3 years , so I came here 2000 . 
 Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ? 
 Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? 

So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? 
 Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ? 
 Oh , I am so sorry . 

So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? 
 That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time . 
 Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . 
 Great ! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday . 
 Really good ! you should try it sometime . 
 Uh , nothing much , just went to bed early . I was still tired from Saturday . 
 Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . 
 About three times a week if I can . 
 Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . 
 They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . 
 No way , if it still has 21 . 
 Me ? I prefer France . 
 Oh , really ? I went to China last winter ! 
 I agree ... 
 Just now we both thought it would be fine . 
 We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet . 
 At least 20 days . 
 My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . 
 No , usually they're very busy . 
 I go to bed at ten and get up at six . 
 Sure . 
 I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . 
 Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . 
 That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . 
 She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . 
 Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . 
 Doctor Butcher . 
 No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit . 
 Yes I do , usually . 
 I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . 
 I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . 
 I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . 
 I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . 
 I like variety shows . 
 I prefer a variety show without a host . 
 It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? 
 Wow , I doubt that . 
 Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . 
 Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . 
 What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 
 Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? 
 And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . 
 What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . 
 Yeah , about . 
 Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . 
 I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . 
 I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . 
 Yes , absolutely true . 
 Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . 
 You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? 
 I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? 
 I am going there , too . We can walk together . 

You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 

I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ? 
 Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? 
 Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? 
 You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? 
 If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . 

Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? 
 Is it worth seeing ? 

Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . 
 Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . 
 What's that ? 

Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . 
 Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . 
 It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . 

I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . 
 You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . 
 Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . 
 Maybe that's why he's so nice ! 
 From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . 
 I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . 
 Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . 
 I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? 
 No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? 
 I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles . 
 Have you been to California ? 
 How many kids do you have ? 
 Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime . 
 No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . 
 It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? 

Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . 
 Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . 

Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . 
 I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . 
 They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . 
 Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? 
 Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? 
 That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? 
 With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . 

Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? 
 Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... 

The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? 
 It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . 
 Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? 

What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? 
 The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? 
 Sounds like you really learned a lot . 

What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? 
 I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better . 
 The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.Also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better . 
 Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? 
 You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... 

At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... 
 Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... 
 I guess I'd buy that ... 
 He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . 
 Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . 
 That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . 
 It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . 
 Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . 
 No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . 
 He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . 

How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? 
 Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? 
 Why would you say that ? 
 I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . 
 Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . 
 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 How can you live without job in the future ? 

Why are you in such a hurry ? 
 Don't worry , do it step by step 
 Don't worry , do it step by step . 

Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . 
 Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . 
 No , it's not . 
 Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . 

Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . 
 Two tickets , please . How much are they ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . 
 Are these seats okay ? 

How are you getting along with your wife now ? 
 What are you going to do then ? 
 How are your work now ? 

Did you tip the bellboy ? 
 That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . 
 I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . 
 Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . 
 John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 
 I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . 

Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . 
 When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . 
 Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . 
 Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . 

Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . 
 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
 It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . 

Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! 

Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . 
 It ’ s all right . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 
 I totally understand . 
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 
 Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
 It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
 Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . 
 Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . 
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 
 Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? 
 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . 
 That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . 
 Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . 
 Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 
 Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . 
 I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . 
 Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . 
 Huh ? 
 It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . 
 Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . 
 Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . 
 It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . 
 Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . 
 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . 
 I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
 I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . 
 I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . 
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? 

Hi , my name is Ted , what ’ s yours ? 
 I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? 
 Do you somewhere often , Laura ? 
 Let ’ s go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 
 I asked if you come here often . 
 No , this is my first time here . 
 Yeah , that ’ s why I ’ m here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . 
 I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park . 
 Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . 
 Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . 

Do you have much experience with kids ? 
 To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 
 I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . 
 Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . 

So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? 
 You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? 
 You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . 
 Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . 
 Probably you ’ re right . 
 George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . 
 Where will we sleep , then ? 
 What about other expenses ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? 
 Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . 
 Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! 

How is your job search going , Janet ? 
 Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! 
 I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . 
 Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . 
 And then what ? 
 That sounds boring to me . 
 Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . 

How good are you at sports , Bill ? 
 Wow ! 
 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 

So do you believe in palmistry ? 
 It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . 
 Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 
 Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... 
 Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... 
 You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . 

So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 
 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
 I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . 
 That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . 
 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
 I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . 

I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . 
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . 
 It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . 
 Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? 
 What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? 
 That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . 

Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 
 Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . 
 Why can't we ? 
 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
 I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . 
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 

I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . 
 You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... 
 What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? 
 Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? 
 Do you go to church regularly ? 

How is the college search going ? 
 But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? 
 I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... 
 I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . 

Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . 
 That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . 
 They see their independence as a kind of character strength . 

I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
 It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . 
 And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 

So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 
 That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 
 I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . 
 Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
 My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . 

Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? 
 Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? 
 How did you get involved in something like that ? 
 So what do you do there ? 
 Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? 
 I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... 

So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? 
 Stereotypes ? Like what ? 
 I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . 
 You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . 
 Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . 
 I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . 
 Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 
 Isn ’ t that complicated ? 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 
 What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? 
 No , what ? 
 Why ? 
 Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! 
 I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . 
 True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . 
 Huh ? Me ? 
 Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? 
 Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . 
 Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can . 

Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 
 Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . 
 Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . 
 No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . 
 Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . 
 Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . 
 This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . 
 So , tell me , Karl , hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 

What do you do in your spare time ? 
 Do you mind if I come along sometime ? 

Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . 
 Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? 
 So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? 
 Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? 
 That ’ s a great employment benefit ! 

Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . 
 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
 Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . 
 That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . 

Can you believe the headlines ? 
 I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 He got arrested all right . 
 Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . 
 That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 

Hi , Kate . 
 Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . 
 Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . 

I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . 
 Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . 
 Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . 

What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? 
 You're becoming a real television watcher . 

I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world . 
 I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one . 

Merry Christmas ! Mary ! 
 Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much . 

What do you think of the play showed last night ? 
 Yes , I turned it off when the fight got heated in it . 

Do you have any plan on your mind ? 
 How are we going there , by bike or by bus ? 

I wonder if we can change to Channel 26 . 
 A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like . 

What channel did you watch last night ? 
 You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? 

What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
 How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . 

Did you watch the live telecast of the World Cup last night ? 
 What's the band called ? 

Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . 
 You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? 
 Do you ever get lonely living alone ? 

So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good . 
 He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too . 
 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
 That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 
 Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ? 
 OK . 
 No , it might be dangerous there . 
 I'd like to , but I'm tied up with my paper . 
 No.Why ? 
 Oh , really ? I go to the rye every day . 
 It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . 
 I don't know . 
 I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best . 
 I wish I had been there ! 
 You have good taste in music . 
 Believe me , you really look much better than before . 

Your muscles are a spectacle ! 
 No , but I am starting working out from now on . 

What's your weight ? 
 Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . 

Do you remember Tina , my good friend ? 
 She just broke up with her boyfriend . 
 But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . 
 Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . 
 It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not . 
 Very good , What's on ? 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 Is your brother older or younger than you ? 

Great party , isn ’ t it ? 
 By the way , my name is Liu Wei . 
 What do you do , Susan ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 

Hello 。 this is Susan . 
 Yes , I think So . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t.because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you . 
 Good bye ! 
 No , it's the Japanese team . 
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 
 Swimming in summer and skating in winter.What ' s your favorite sport ? 
 No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing.People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning.It can help people keep fit.It has a history of over three hundred years . 
 Yes . it is I can teach you if you like . 
 Right . Let's help each other . 
 It's love all . 
 Can you tell which team seems to win ? 
 Yes.Our guest team is really tough . 

What's the score ? 
 The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . 

Do you like a package tour or to travel alone ? 
 I prefer travel alone . I'll have a lot of time lingering at one place . 
 Could you stay a little longer ? 
 In that case , I won ’ t keep you.Remember to give me a call . 

Have you ever been to any other country ? 
 That's also my dream . 
 Why not ? 
 We have a beautiful natural park . 
 Come on.Let ' s walk there . 
 I used to work as a teacher . 
 Oh , if I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it . 
 Have you any definite idea ? 
 I think you'd better try an active job . 
 Yes , but it's not so appetizing . 
 That's what's hanging on my mind recently . 
 How long will you be there ? 
 So you'll have a tour of the famous city . 

I heard many stories about your brother . 
 What does he look like ? Is he handsome ? 

I like hitchhiking.will you go with me ? 
 It's a pity.Say , how about a place near enough ? 
 New England . 

Your father looks much younger in the picture . 
 How old is he now ? 

What a brilliant smile ! 
 He must be very easy-going . 

What shall I call him ? 
 What's he doing ? 

Is this your brother-in-law ? 
 From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . 

I like this kind of weather . 
 And it's calm . I like the peace . 

Fairly warm this morning , isn't it ? 
 Say , how about a walk along the river ? 

I'm going to Ireland this summer . 
 No , I'd like to go alone . 

What did you do last vacation ? 
 What will you do this vacation ? 

Say , do you go to see your grandparents often ? 
 You are very lucky . 
 Alps , suppose . 
 Right . 
 What a good idea ! 
 OK . 
 Yeah , how do you like him ? 
 Can you give me a touch of his character ? 

Is this a photo of your family ? 
 You look so lovely . 

The sun is shining . 
 That's the sign of wind . 

What does your mother do , may I ask ? 
 Is she busy ? 

Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? 
 She's looks very healthy.How old is she ? 

It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 Tomorrow will be fine too , I think . 

What lovely weather ! 
 Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . 

This is my uncle , Charles . 
 He's a captain . 
 Exactly ! 
 Neither.The game ended in two all . 
 But the Brazilian is tougher . 
 Did you see his last dive ? 
 He's diving for the gold . 
 I can see the sun now . 
 Anyway , I dislike summer here.There ' s too much rainfall . 
 How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ? 
 Oh , you've already grown up , son . 
 Yes , all of us have naps . 
 No , not at all . 
 Why not ? China is a wonderful country . 
 No , I'm afraid not now . I'm too busy . 
 Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? 
 I'll finish soon . 
 Her acting is OK . 
 I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? 
 That of the old man . 
 Some of the scenes moved me into tears . 
 Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . 
 Yes , but I don't like the story . 
 Oh , it's really a drag . 
 Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! 
 What kind of movie is it ? 
 Oh , I've no interest in such films . 
 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 
 But it's only a film . 
 I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . 

I plan to buy a car this year . 
 I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . 

Going to the cafeteria ? 
 That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . 

How was your education going on in Australia ? 
 Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? 
 Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
 Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . 
 Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . 
 Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . 
 It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . 
 I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . 
 Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... 
 Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . 
 Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... 
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 How did you get wind of the rumor ? 
 Let ’ s stop gossiping and get back to work . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . 
 Sure , but what do I wear ? 

Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . 
 Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . 

Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 
 This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
 Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . 
 I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . 
 Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! 
 not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . 
 I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . 
 Let's hope it is ! 
 Yes , that's true . 
 It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . 
 Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . 
 Yes , it's really wonderful ! 
 I'm sure you'll have a good time . 
 How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? 
 Why don't we just make it a friendly game ? 

Is there anything worth watching on another channel ? 
 Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it . 
 Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ? 
 Are you interested in watching it ? 
 Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ? 
 Do you want to watch it ? 

Jason , it's your turn . 
 You rolled a four . Let's see ... you landed on Foreign Films . 
 Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ? 
 The answer is Belle Opaque . It's a Spanish movie , and the title means The Age of Beauty in English . 
 I didn't know you liked old movies . 
 You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial ! 

We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot . 
 OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ? 
 Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! 
 Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . 
 You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . 
 Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! 
 It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie ! 
 I guess that's just the luck of the draw . 
 Sorry , not tonight ! 
 The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola . 
 Only about old movies , really ... 
 What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? 
 Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages . 
 Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ... 
 Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids . 
 And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery ! 

What upsets you ? 
 It is not your mother finding one for you ? 
 Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . 
 No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . 
 I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . 
 Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . 
 I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . 
 But they are so silly ! They're not art ! 
 James Cameron , of course . 
 Well , nobody's perfect ! 
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
 Just look around ? Nah , that ’ s boring . 

I never watch foreign films . They're too boring . 
 Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! 
 Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . 

How's your new job going ? 
 How are you finding your new boss ? 
 Would you rather have her or your old boss back ? 
 How about your new co-workers ? 
 Do you miss your old co-workers ? 
 Do people in different departments get along with each other ? 
 Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? 
 Do you like working in teams ? 

hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? 
 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? 
 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? 
 do you have experience in the IT field ? 
 do you speak Spanish ? 
 that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? 
 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? 
 I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . 

OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ? 
 Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures . 
 I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s . 

How did your interview go ? 
 If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? 
 Will you get a pay-raise , too ? 
 That makes sense . Who interviewed you ? 
 What kinds of questions did she ask you ? 
 The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? 
 Those are good answers . How did she react ? 
 What do you think about her as a boss ? 
 You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! 
 When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . 

Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! 
 No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! 

Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? 
 Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! 

Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? 
 I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . 

Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . 
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . 

You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! 
 I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee . 
 I'm Robert , at your service . 

How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! 

My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? 
 You sneak ! 
 But that's a lot of money ! Honey ! 
 I really love this music . It's a compilation . 
 And you got them off the Net ? 
 Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record ! 

OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . 
 No , I don't . 
 Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . 
 OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? 
 Froth ? 
 Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . 
 If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item . 
 eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase . 

Who got ripped off ? 
 Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . 
 There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . 

I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... 
 Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones . 
 Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! 

Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . 
 I don't know . I dropped out at $ 250 . 
 No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was . 
 You know all about coffee . I need your advice , so I won't look stupid when I order . 
 Come on , Hugh ! Tea is for wimps ! Please , I need your help . 
 Now you're talking . That sounds good . What is it ? 
 Snipers ? 
 So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? 
 Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . 
 Not really . 
 Please don't tell me you bought it . 
 If you did , you probably got ripped off . 
 Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? 
 You've gone bonkers , Jen . 
 OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet . 
 You might make a few enemies this way . 
 You mean your friends . I think it's cruel . 
 Hurry ! Get a shot ! ... Hand it over ! 

Look , the aliens are sending a message to Mulder . This rocks ! 
 You have a pager ? ! That's a little high-tech for you , Stu . Are you sure you know how to use it ? 
 No , you don't ! It's still beeping ! Come on , hand it over and I'll turn it off for you . 
 So why is the face tilted to the right ? 
 So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? 
 I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... 

Well , humans could never make something like that . 
 Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! 
 Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! 
 It's a camera . 
 Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . 
 Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . 
 If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . 
 Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . 
 OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . 
 Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . 
 Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? 
 I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . 
 Steve , I was born ready ! I ’ m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today . 
 Let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ’ ll help me loosen up . 

Anyone home ? Jen ! 
 Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! 
 You look like a cooking show host--only messier . 
 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . 
 Yeah , I will . 
 Yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? 
 I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . 
 Then you can buy Aspirin . 
 Yes , here this is . 
 Thank you and take care . 
 I've got a headache . 
 No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . 
 Well , you'll see . With this new watch , I can go anywhere , do anything . 
 No , really . Look . It's got a double time zone setting . 
 Yep . I just can't decide what two cities to choose ... 

You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Is he getting better now ? 

I heard you've found a new job . 
 So you're quite happy with your new job ? 

And what's your vision ? 
 Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 They don't have toilets at the campground ? 

Hey , check out this new game I bought today . 
 I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies . 
 Yes . In fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films . 
 Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either . 
 Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ? 
 You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ? 
 No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign . 
 Yeah , are you surprised ? 

Are you ready for the camping trip ? 
 Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature . 
 I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack . 
 That's trail mix ! 

My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping ! 
 Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection . 
 You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning ! 
 Near sighted . 
 The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . 

I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . 
 You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? 
 But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . 
 Sure , I have . Will you join ? 
 You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
 No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . 

Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . 
 Thank you , shall I open it now ? 
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . 
 Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . 
 You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? 
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . 

I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? 
 To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . 
 Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? 

Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? 
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 
 James is going to be packed off there . 

I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . 
 But mine could be a lie for his job . 
 A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . 
 Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . 
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . 
 Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . 
 It is such a nice place . 

Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . 
 Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . 
 It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . 
 I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . 
 Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . 
 Guess what ? He has just got the sack . 
 Exactly . 
 Have you thought about it seriously ? 
 Ok , did you find a new company ? 
 Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . 

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? 
 Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . 
 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . 

I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . 
 It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? 
 Certainly . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . 
 Then keep up the good work . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . 
 Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . 
 I will do my best . 
 Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . 
 That ’ s the way to go . 
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . 
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . 

Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? 
 I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . 
 Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? 

I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 
 I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . 
 I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . 
 Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . 

Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 
 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . 
 Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . 
 You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . 
 In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! 
 I do back flips at the pool all the time . 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... 
 It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 
 Then I bet he's really good ! 

I don't know . I think you might be over the hill . 
 Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ? 

How do I look in this new dress ? 
 How about this one ? 

Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious . 
 Next time , it's on me . 
 I'm serious . 
 Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . 

I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . 
 Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? 
 Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . 
 How ? By drinking ? 
 When did you begin to drink ? 
 And then ? 
 So you get drunk every day ? 
 Open the door . It's me . I can't find the key . 
 Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? 
 So let's eat out . 
 Noodles . How about you ? 

If I can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , I think beach volleyball might be my ticket . 
 It's a beautiful sport , isn't it ? 
 OK , OK . Enough already . We'd better hustle . The contest starts in five minutes . 
 He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? 
 I can think of better things to dream about ... 
 That's crazy . 
 Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . 
 How about transom ? 
 Oh , i nearly forget it . 

Which season do you like best ? 
 I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . 
 Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . 
 Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . 
 A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . 

Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 You are really career minded . 

Have you ever played Making ? 
 Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . 
 It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . 
 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . 
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? 
 My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . 
 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . 

Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? 
 Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? 
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . 

How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? 
 You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? 
 Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . 
 Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . 
 I will think about it . 

A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? 
 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . 
 Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . 

Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . 
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . 

How long have you been in this company ? 
 You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 

Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 
 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
 But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . 

I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . 
 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... 
 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
 Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
 Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! 
 You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? 
 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . 
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends . 
 Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . 
 I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . 
 I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . 
 I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . 
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . 
 When will we get one of those ? 

Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
 Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! 

I think I need a new notebook . 
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 Believe it ! 

Uh ... that's Greek to me . 
 Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . 
 So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . 

Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . 
 Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . 
 That's Madame Psychic to you . 
 Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! 
 I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . 
 I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . 
 I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . 
 Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . 
 Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . 
 Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . 
 First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . 
 From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . 
 It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . 
 You bought a compact car ? 
 Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive . 
 I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo . 
 hey , Isabelle ... 
 yes , I am the guy ... 
 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 Now what are you doing ? 
 Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . 
 And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . 
 Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . 
 Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . 
 Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . 

Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? 
 I guess I need all of them . 
 I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . 

You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 
 It's not breathing ! 
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . 

Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . 
 I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . 
 If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . 
 Not really , do you ? 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 
 That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? 

Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
 What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? 
 Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... 
 That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . 
 That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . 
 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ? 
 See you ! 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 
 Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! 
 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
 I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . 

I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . 
 What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? 
 I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? 

Hi , Francis . 
 Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . 
 Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . 
 Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . 
 Me too . Have a great day . 
 The board has been considering introducing flex time . 
 Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . 
 Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? 
 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 

Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? 
 Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
 I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . 
 That ’ s a matter of opinion . 
 I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . 
 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? 
 Do you import any food items ? 

I am really tired of Terry . 
 He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . 
 We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . 
 From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! 
 Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! 
 Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? 
 That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? 
 Sounds like a lot of work ! 

I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . 
 Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . 
 I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! 
 Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ... 
 But he is always talking big . 
 Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? 
 What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? 
 Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? 
 I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? 

The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . 
 The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... 
 First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... 

Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . 
 Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . 

It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . 
 Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . 

Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . 
 I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . 
 I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . 
 I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... 
 Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . 
 It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . 
 Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . 
 15 . 
 He ’ s not quite 25 . 
 Yes . 
 No . But I write to them often . 
 Once a month . 
 Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . 
 Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . 
 Well . Thank you for coming . 
 Bye . 
 Yeah . How's everything going ? 
 Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . 
 Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . 
 Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . 
 Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . 
 Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . 
 One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . 
 Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . 
 The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . 
 Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . 
 When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers . 
 Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? 
 Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . 
 I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? 
 You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . 
 Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? 
 8 pm , that's fine with me . 
 So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . 
 Ok , George . Bye ! 

What is the weather like today ? 
 And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
 It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery . 
 That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . 
 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . 
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . 
 I can't . I am really behind of my work . 
 All right.That ’ s very nice of you . 
 I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . 
 Yes . I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake . 
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Wow . You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
 Well , bring him along to . We will have a great time this weekend . 

Hello , Tony . Fancy meeting you here . How are things going with you ? 
 Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ? 
 Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Well , I am going to a football match . I need to go . 
 Thanks , I will , byebye ! 
 About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . 
 Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . 
 It ’ s exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
 Begin at 9 o ’ clock sharp . 
 Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Say hi to your parents for me . I hope to see them soon . 
 Yes , I will . Take care , then . 

Did you lock the doors ? 
 Well , I ’ m going on to bed . I ’ m beat . 
 Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ’ t want dog down there tonight . 

Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? 
 What would you like to see in Beijing ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up here tomorrow . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve just come back from Scotland . 
 I only had time to visit Edinburgh . 
 It ’ s fantastic . 
 I went to there on business . 
 Yes , a lot of friends . 
 Yes . And I took many pictures . 
 Well . My watch says five past two . But it ’ s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days . 
 Yes . I will . 
 Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . 
 Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties . 
 Oh , so you're a teacher . 
 I'm in the car business . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Nice to meet you , I'm jim taylor . 
 Of course not . 
 Laura . 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . 
 Well , we come here almost every month . 
 It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . 
 No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care , and give my best to your parents . 

Did you go to see Michael last night ? 
 Did he let you ride it ? 
 Weren ’ t you frightened ? 
 Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ? 
 But why ? Since you like it so much . 

Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . 
 Ok , Goodbye . 

Good morning miss . Wang 
 It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ? 
 I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat 

Thank you for coming to see me off . 
 If I have time , I will come again . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn ’ t cause you too much trouble during my stay . 
 I ’ m afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . 

Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ? 
 Doing anything for lunch ? 

It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it 
 Shall I light the stove ? 
 Well . What ’ s the climate like in your country ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 

The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . 
 Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . 
 Autumn is also very nice In Washington . 
 No . it isn ’ t . But sometimes it slows a lot in winter . 
 Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily 
 There ’ s a lot of rain in summer . But it seldom rains in autumn 
 That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here . 
 No . I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . 

Guess , what I ’ Ve bought for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 that ’ s all right . 
 You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ’ s pleasant raise . it ’ s so lovely 
 That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring 
 So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Oh . It ’ s pity you have to leave . 
 I'm glad you enjoy it . 
 The same to you ! 
 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 

How about going swimming ? 
 Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here . 

Have a nice weekend ! 
 Do you have any plans ? 
 Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . 
 Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . 

Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my school-mates . 
 Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . 
 I think it ’ s my ankle . 
 One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks . 
 I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore . 
 It ’ s that really necessary ? 

Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
 Who won ? 
 What is the score ? 
 Wonderful . 
 Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages.How ' Ve you been ? 
 Not bad.It really is great to see you again.Where have you been ? 

Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus . 
 Okay . It will be a new experience for me . 
 where do we pay the fare ? 
 Let me pay for it . 
 Ask the worker who sells token to give you one . It ’ s free of charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . 
 Is that so ? I didn't know it.Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie ? 
 Then we return to the hotel and come back.Will you change the appointment ? 
 At seven , please . 
 A party of three . 

So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window.Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 

Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . 
 Thank you . 
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . 
 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 

Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run.It was nice talking to you , karren . 
 I guess we'll see just around . 
 You too . 
 Yeah , I didn't get the job in the end . 
 It's ok , that's life . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you kown.Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 I'm planing to go bolling tonight.Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie.What about you ? 
 Why not ? 

I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . 
 How about the new bar across road ? 
 I agree , I had lunch there last week . 

Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 It's difficult to explain . 
 Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job . 
 I don't know , I can't stand my job these days . 

Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? 
 Nice to meet you too.Let me help you with your bags . 
 Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , i could you some help.Thank you so much . 

Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how do I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . 
 Merry Christmas to you . 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Just a minute . It ’ s ten to nine by my watch . 
 What ’ s the hurry ? 
 It ’ s plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won ’ t take your twenty minutes to get there . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 

Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ? 
 But I'm afraid it will take too much of my time . 
 Em , you ’ re right . 
 I don ’ t think so . 
 That ’ s should be fun . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Well , Yes . There are something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . 
 Well , Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet . 
 Well , some money of course , a vise , all my identity cards and some photos . 
 Yes , I have already done that and they already look for it . I ’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly . 
 Yes , quite sure . 
 But that takes too long . 

What kind of movies do you like , Sue ? 
 Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ? 
 Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . 
 Sorry , I ’ m not a volleyball-fun . I ’ d rather play football . How about you , Mr . Wang . ? Are you interested in volleyball ? 

Would you come to spend the weekend with us ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 

I ’ m sorry , Sam . I don ’ t want to foc-concert . 
 I don ’ t like going to the theatre . 
 traveling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? 
 I like talking to you too . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? 
 Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? 

So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? 
 That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time . 
 Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . 
 Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? 
 Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . 
 I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . 
 About 3 years , so I came here 2000 . 
 Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ? 
 Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? 

So , John , what do you do for a living ? 
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? 
 Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? 

So Janet , do you do any sports ? 
 Yeah , how often do you go ? 
 Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? 

Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . 
 Well , drop by if you can . 
 No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . 
 The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . 
 I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . 
 Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . 
 What's wrong , Julia ? 
 Don't give up so soon . 
 Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . 
 Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? 
 He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . 
 He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . 
 That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . 
 Good . How about you ? 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . 
 That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . 
 But you have already worked there for five years . 
 Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . 

Let's take a coffee break , shall we ? 
 What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours . You've got to walk around.You just can't stay on the computer forever . 
 I understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while . 
 Here . Are you all right ? 
 I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . 
 Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . 
 You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . 
 Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? 
 I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work . 

You look tired . 
 Really ? How come ? 
 You shouldn't work so hard . 
 What do you mean ? 

Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . 
 But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? 
 No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . 
 It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . 
 Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . 
 Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . 
 You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . 
 No , nothing else . See you Monday . 

Did you see May today ? 
 I don't have the foggiest idea . 
 Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . 

Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . 
 Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . 
 My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . 
 No , not really . 
 No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . 
 You are a pessimist . 

Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? 
 Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? 
 Great , so what happens now ? 

So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? 
 And how do you like working for IBM ? 
 What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? 
 That ’ s good . We always need team players here . 
 Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . 
 Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . 
 Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . 
 Sure , When is good time for you ? 
 What time do you want me there ? 
 All right , It's a date . 
 He is a worker . 
 She is a nurse . 
 Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend 
 Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 
 Six thirty , tonight . 
 All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye ! 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 Is your brother older or younger than you ? 

Great party , isn ’ t it ? 
 By the way , my name is Liu Wei . 
 What do you do , Susan ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 
 My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you , Susan . 
 I come from China.Are you American ? 
 Business management 

Excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ? 
 Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ? 
 Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while ? 
 Thanks a lot 
 Of course.Don ' t worry . I'll call one for you . 
 Yes , besides it versa according to the distance . 
 No problem . 
 You are welcome , bye . 
 Oh , Mr Green , my name is Jianshan . You don't know me , but I'm a friend of David Smith . 
 When I told David I was coming here to live , he give me your number , and suggest that I give your a ring . I was wondering if you could give me some advices . 
 Well , I'm looking for a place to live . David thought as you are a @ agent . you might know something is suitable . 
 Yes , I've got the address . 
 I'm at the post office . 
 Thank you very much , Mr Green . 

I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? 
 Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? 
 ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . 
 See you later . 

Hello ! 
 Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 I am leaving in two weeks . 
 Oh , I am sorry , Jason . I've already got plans for Friday evening . How about Saturday ? 
 7 is fine with me . 
 I'll be waiting . 
 My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ? 
 That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ? 
 Do you enjoy work here ? 
 Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . 
 Glad to hear that . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Ted ! Don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you ’ Ve got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her . 
 But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? 

Long time no see ! 
 It's nice to see you again . Have you changed jobs ? 
 That's nice . Where have you been ? 
 Are you busy now ? 
 How about a coffee in that cafe ? 

Do you have a boyfriend ? 
 Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . 
 So I think I may fall in love with her . 
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? 
 That's what I did . 
 Yes . 
 That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . 
 Thanks . But I know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another . 
 Yeah . Falling in love is so good ! 

Hi , Mike . Haven't seen you for a while . How's Cathy ? 
 What happened ? Did you break up ? 
 Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ? 
 Oh , you are such a dog ! 
 Nope . I guess something might have come up . 
 I don't know . I hope it's nothing serious . 
 Oh ? What happened ? 
 Is she fine now ? 
 Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . 
 She is so pretty sick . 
 Thank you . 
 What do you mean ? 
 That is called a nuclear family . 
 What kind of family are you like ? 
 It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . 

Gino , do you really need to go ? 
 But don't forget to give me a ring . 
 Take care of yourself . 
 Bye , my boy . 
 New York Times . I read it everyday . 
 It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting . 
 Yes , they have a good reputation for fairness . 
 Well , it depends . 
 No , I think the music is too fast . 
 It sounds nice . 
 Yes , I think so . It's very emotional . 
 Full of energy and hope . 
 Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award . 
 Yes , reading is my hobby . 
 Many kinds of books . When I was a child in elementary school , I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . When I became to a teenager at middle school , I was interested in detective mystery stories . Now I like reading romance stories . 
 Why ? 
 Well , maybe . 
 Oh , great ! 
 I like No . 4 . 
 Yes . In fact , I think it's much better than this week's No . 1 . 
 I like it as well , but I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart . 
 Well . I don't like Your Lips very much . 
 I think it's too slow makes me sleepy . In fact , it's the worst in this week ’ s top ten , if you ask me . 

Can we have two tickets for seven thirty ? 
 In the front , please . 
 Thank you . And what's on tomorrow ? 
 Can we get tickets now ? 

What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? 
 What do you like best about it ? 
 What do you think of the ending ? 

So what did you think about the movie ? 
 Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! 
 Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . 
 It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . 
 I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . 
 Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? 
 Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . 
 I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . 
 Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . 

Here is the song list . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Let me play it for you . 
 It's very easy . Here it is . Ready ? Excellent ! You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well . 
 I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging , first in Chinese then in English . 

Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . 
 I don't know . If we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers . 
 Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture . 
 Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! 
 Yeah , let's do so . 
 What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line . 
 I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn . 
 The same to you , Joey . 
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 

As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . 
 Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . 
 That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . 

What's your hobby ? 
 What's the make of your camera ? 
 Do you own your own darkroom ? 
 Why ? 

I need some flowers for my girlfriend . 
 Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion . 
 Money is no object . 
 I will take ten . 
 Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 
 That's ok . Here is the address . 
 Thank you . Same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ? 

Where is Pamela ? 
 She told me she'd be here . 
 Are you rushing me ? 
 I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? 
 Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . 
 Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . 
 Thank you for being a friend of mine . 
 Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . 
 On this occasion , most people do . 
 She is a beautiful bride . 
 Are you crying ? 
 Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . 
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 
 For the wedding ? 
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 
 Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . 
 They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources . 
 Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
 Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
 Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 
 Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . 
 Nothing seems to be happier for them . 
 Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again . 
 Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! 
 Yes , I am . My wife and I understand each other . 
 I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . 
 That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life . 
 That's true . Her husband is a fat cat . 
 She is only after his money . 
 But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 
 Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? 
 I like that joke , but I hope it's true . 
 Well . I am breaking up with Cathy . 
 No . She is really a very nice girl ... 
 Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she ’ s just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself . 
 I've tried , but it didn't work . 
 Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her . 
 I know ... 
 Hi , Jenny . It's David here . 
 Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . 
 Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . 
 What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . 
 But she lied to me . 
 Ok , then . 
 What face ? 
 Yeah , I know . You are right . 
 Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? 
 August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? 
 Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . 
 I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? 
 Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? 

I heard you are going out with John ? 
 You are so lucky . 
 Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find . Few boys are so caring , so patient , and did I mention he is hottie ? 
 Totally . I am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too . 

Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? 
 No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? 
 That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . 
 People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . 
 If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . 
 Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . 
 I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . 
 I like company . 
 What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . 
 You want to go out with me and you know it . 
 Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? 
 That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . 
 Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . 
 It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon . 

I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . 
 Where is she going to college ? 
 Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! 

Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? 
 Did you finish typing yesterday ? 
 Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? 
 How about the shelf ? 
 Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . 
 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 
 You ’ Ve put it among these journals . 

You have a lovely house , Jack . 
 That's too bad . What problems are you having . 
 I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? 
 Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . 
 Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . 
 Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . 

Hello ! 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . 
 Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? 
 No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? 
 I am an accountant at a company 
 It's nice meeting you too , Alice . 
 Goodbye , Alice . 
 Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you . 
 Thank you , they are beautiful . 
 I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it . 
 I'll try . 
 I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . 
 I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . 

Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea . 
 It may have something to do with the food I had last night 
 I will . Thank you . 
 I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
 Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . 
 I had to go get a cavity filled today . 
 I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! 
 It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . 
 No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! 
 I do , but it still does not cover everything . 
 Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? 
 Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? 
 Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . 
 Really ? No , they couldn't . None of them would have jobs if they did . 
 He said that I have been eating too much . 
 Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . 

Hi , John ! How was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow , isn't that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 

Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? 
 Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . 
 You can say that . 
 They must have mixed hackers with crackers . 
 There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . 
 Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . 
 You got it . 
 You are welcome . 
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River . 
 It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . 
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 
 Ok , see you . 
 What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ? 
 Well , I am kind of broke . 
 Really ? It's very nice of you . 
 Wonderful ! You know what ? I wish you wanted to relax everyday . 

It's a perfect day for swimming . 
 Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. 
 No . Thanks for reminding me . 
 Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? 
 Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . 
 Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . 
 Jim ! 
 Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . 
 Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! 
 We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing . 
 There were six of us . 
 Yes , we got wet through . But we still enjoyed ourselves . 
 I like reading novels about early America . 
 Which one do you like best ? 
 Yup . Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great . 

Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . 
 Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . 
 But it's already awfully close . 
 I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . 

So how did you meet Bill ? 
 Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? 
 I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . 
 I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . 
 I just want a private conversation with one other person . 
 Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . 
 It ’ s that popular ? 

Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? 
 Well . You'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold . 

Good morning , Jim ! 
 Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze . 
 We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ? 
 He ’ s predicting clear skies . 

What a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I hope it stays like this . 
 Is the weather usually like this here ? 
 What's the weather like in winter ? 
 I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . 
 Neither too cold , nor too hot . 
 Yes , especially in spring . 
 Once , when I was a child . 
 Now and then . 

How do you do ? 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens . 
 Thank you . 
 I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . 
 My car didn't want to start either at first . 
 Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . 
 I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . 
 Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . 

Lousy weather , isn't it ? 
 Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . 
 Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
 It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . 
 That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . 
 I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me . 
 Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . 
 You ’ re darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style 

Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? 
 Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ? 
 Darned right I would ! 
 Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . 
 I don't care what other people think . I am ready for a lift . 
 Where are they from ? 
 What are they doing in Beijing ? 
 Which hotel are they staying at ? 

Look how fast that car can accelerate ! 

How ’ s the food ? 
 Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all ! 
 I eat dog food when my parents are out . 
 Poor us ! All this junk food lacks nutrition ! 
 Good idea ! 
 Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning . 
 Well , in the afternoon , after a long nap , we ’ ll go yachting with Nora . 
 How about you ? What are you going to do tomorrow ? 

Lily , do you know Lizzy ? 
 Lizzy smith . 
 Then , Do you know her younger sister ? 
 Yes . 
 Oh , not bad . Then do you know her mother ? 
 That sounds terrific . 
 I just want to visit the family some day . 
 What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . 
 Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? 
 Ok , I will go there myself . 
 It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? 

Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
 Yeah , those classics from the great writers . 

Hi , how is it going ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . 

You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . 
 And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . 
 Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . 
 You don ’ t love me ? 
 But we ’ re so right for each other . 

Hi , David ! What are you doing ? 
 Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... 
 Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in . 
 How about the Classical Music Club ? 
 Hey-how about the Cinema Club ? 

Have you ever made any plan for your future ? 
 Not me . I'd like to be a bachelor forever . 

Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? 
 Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? 
 It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . 
 It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? 

Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ? 
 Did you use to work at NYU ? 
 Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student . 
 Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university . 
 Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now . 
 Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . 

What ’ s on TV tonight ? 
 Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . 
 No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny . 
 Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . 
 It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . 
 No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game . 
 Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . 
 Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . 
 I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . 
 The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! 
 I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . 
 Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . 
 Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . 
 Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . 
 Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite . 
 Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! 
 To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? 

You really should stop smoking , you know . 
 How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ? 
 Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker . 
 He died of lung cancer , right ? 

When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . 
 And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . 

What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 It sounds too bad . What will you do ? 
 That ’ s what I want to say . 
 What ? 
 That sounds like fun . 
 Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both . 
 Gee , that's really nice of you . 
 Why not ? 
 So what ? His father is in prison , not he . 
 Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . 
 Tomorrow afternoon would be fine . 
 A few months . 
 Great ! I'm having a great time . 
 It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory . 
 It's easier said than done . When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . 
 Total Fitness , why ? 
 Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good . 
 Oh , it ’ s one of those places . 
 Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people . 
 Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna . 
 The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too . 
 Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? 
 Perfect . See you later . 

Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? 
 What position do you play ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . 
 The Rockets . 
 All right , see you later . 
 Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? 
 I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . 
 No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . 
 Maybe you'll call his home . 
 I haven't decided yet . 
 Ok , count me in . 
 Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . 
 Sure , thank you . 
 Business couldn't be better . 
 Welcome . I could use the help . 
 I don't mind . Go ahead . 
 OK . You can keep it as long as you need . 
 Only four days . 
 I know . I can't help thinking about her . She's always on my mind . 
 I can play the piano a bit . 
 No , no . My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public . 
 Yes . It's perfect . 
 I couldn't have asked for more . 
 I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good . 
 That sounds great ! 
 But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine . 
 Come on . I don't see any point in arguing about this . Everyone has a right to his own opinion . 
 I think I've caught a cold . Now I'm aching all over . 
 Thank you . I suppose I should go to see a doctor . 
 No , thanks . I have some trouble with my heart , my doctor recommend I to drink less . 
 All right 
 Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November . 
 Yes . I love living here . 
 Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . 
 Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician . 
 Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home . 
 I ’ ll buy you a drink . 

let's go swimming . 
 I know , but I'm really hot . 

Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor . 
 Here's to you , Mary ! 

Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? 
 I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! 

At last ! The weekend comes again ! 
 After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . 

Why are you so crazy about bird-watching ? What do you get out of it ? 
 Really ? 

I couldn't wait to meet you in person . 
 Same here . 

Hey , how was the show ? 
 Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . 

It's awfully quiet around here . 
 I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . 

Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ? 
 That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant . 

Aren't you staying for the party ? 
 I don't blame you for getting some rest . 

Do you often go to watch sports games ? 
 Can you recall the games ? 

Why don't we Chinese have our own Valentine's Day ? 
 Oh ? Why is that day ? 

Harry , do you like the opera ? 
 Why is that ? It is called real art . 
 Yeah , that makes sense . 
 I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... 
 Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . 
 But , I want to ride it , Daddy . 
 Great . Let's go . 
 No , I think Harry will get it . 
 OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . 
 Just between you and me , I think he's lazy . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Yes . I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up . 
 Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . 
 Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . 
 I'll miss you too , my friends . 
 Yes . I've got to cancel my traveling plan . 
 The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance . 
 Have you ever been to it before ? 
 Let's go . It sounds interesting . 
 I heard about that . It was successful . 
 I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . 
 What's the problem ? 
 That's easy . If I were you , I'd date me ! 
 Sometimes , if there's music playing . 
 It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . 
 Yes . I'm afraid so . 
 Oh . Well , it can't be helped . 
 No , not yet . I'm really worried . 
 Maybe you're right . But I'm still worried . 
 Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . 
 See you in the court . 
 Keep it . I'm buying tonight . 
 Sure I can , my treat . 
 It's ages since I went to see a film . 
 But now I would stay at home watching TV . 
 Of course not . 
 Laura . 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . 
 Well , we come here almost every month . 
 It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . 
 No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . 
 I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . 
 Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . 
 Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . 
 Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . 
 No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . 

What would you like to have in your breakfast , bread , egg or sandwiches ? 
 And milk or orange juice ? 
 What would you like for lunch , pork , mutton or beef ? 
 What kind of drink do you like most , red wine , beer or champagne ? 
 And among apples , oranges and bananas , which is your favorite ? 
 Do you always have meals outside or in your house ? 

Hi Bob , how ’ s business ? 
 Okay , enough small talk . Let ’ s get down to business . 
 Since we ’ re good friends , you don't have to pay me . 

What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? 
 When is your garden at its best ? 

The May Day holiday is coming . Have you made any plan ? Are you going to stay here or go out for a traveling ? 
 Where have you planned to go ? 
 Then which will be your first choice ? 
 I have decided to go to Tasha . 
 By plane . 
 My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . 
 Yes , I have . But I have to wait . 
 Why ? 
 With snow in Kunming ? That's crazy ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 You were ? 
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . 
 I will . See you later . 
 Not really . I could take it or leave it . 
 How can you do that ? 
 Yes , he is running for class president . 
 Take my word for it . 
 Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . 
 Thank you so much . You're an expert . 
 As a matter of fact , I have . I ran into him just the other day . 
 Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week . 
 I think so , too . 
 I'll be sure to do that . 
 That's more like it . 
 They might actually win the game . 
 Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . 
 Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . 
 Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . 
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 
 Yes , I found a very good job down there . 
 I'm going to miss you folks , too . 
 OK . I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there . 
 It's so faraway . 
 $ 120 ? ! Then I should go and see what I can get ... 
 I'm number seven . What about you ? 
 Hah hah ! You have to go before me . 
 Don't worry . It's safe . 
 You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . 
 I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . 
 I have never tried it . 
 Sorry , I don't think I can . 
 Friday is great . 

I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . 
 What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? 
 Why not ? 
 It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity . 
 Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic . 
 People think it's funny . 
 Well , let's get together soon . 
 Sure . How about Monday ? 
 Well unfortunately , I'm tied up on Tuesday . I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town , and I don't think there's any way I can get out of it.Are you free on Wednesday ? 
 Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . 
 Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? 

Mom , what are you doing ? 
 Still clipping coupons ? 
 Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ? 

What are your working hours ? 
 Much better than mine . 
 Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . 
 Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 . 
 Yes . I bought it in Johnson thrift store . 
 Yes , it is . 

Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work . 
 One less car on the road means less pollution . 
 How far is it ? 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I wish I could do it , but I work in the city . So I take the train . 
 True . Well , see you tomorrow . 

Hey , John . Nice car . 
 What is this , the new Ford ? 
 True . How much did you pay ? 
 Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ? 
 Yeah , sure . 

I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
 I ’ m doing great , thank you . 

Susan ? What brings you here today ? 
 Really ? So what ’ s the news ? 

Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 
 Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? 

Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ? 
 Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ? 
 Sure . Would you like go with me ? 
 You ’ ll have to buy your own ticket though . 
 Wow ! When did you come into so much cash ? 

Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . 
 Really ? 
 I never knew that . 
 Well , we ’ Ve already done our part . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ m getting more sleep these days . The baby ’ s finally growing up a little more . 

Well , what a nice day ! 
 But it was not at all so fine yesterday . 
 Did it ? 
 I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . 
 Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . 
 It'll be dusty , too , I guess . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . 
 Then what about spring ? 
 It must be cold in the winter , though . 
 Thanks for reminding me . 

Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ? 
 It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . 
 Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . 
 I like it so far . But my English still needs work . 

Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . 
 You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! 
 It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . 

Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . 
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? 
 So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . 
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? 
 It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . 

What ? 
 nothing 
 Yes , I am . 
 I don ’ t actually know him . 
 I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . 
 Yes . 

So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? 
 Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . 
 Not for me , Dick . 
 Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
 What is it ? 
 Rock'n'Roll , I guess . 
 Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . 
 Yes I am . And you ... 
 So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . 

Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? 
 So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? 
 Yes . And you're Paul , right ? Paul Hill ? 
 I'm fine . After ten years , you still look great ! 
 Not bad . Let's find a table and sit down . We have a lot to talk about . 

Excuse me , Sir , May I have the time , please ? 
 Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now . 
 Thank you . By the way , what day is today ? 
 Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time . 
 Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question . 
 What's the date today ? 
 Yeah , it was nice to meet you . Hope I run into you again sometime . 
 That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . 
 My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . 
 My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . 
 Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . 
 As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . 
 No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . 
 Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . 
 And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . 
 But as for his business in the city ... 
 He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . 
 Yes , sing a song . But don ’ t sing a sad song . 
 Well , please sing one that ’ s not sad . 

Let ’ s go to the seashore on Saturday . 
 It ’ s expensive , too . Let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead . 

Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . 
 Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . 
 It's May 1st . 
 It's Saturday . Could you make the time ? 
 At nine sharp . 
 Thanks . 
 The usual time . Half past two in the afternoon . 
 The usual place . In front of the treasure house . 
 Your usual shirt and shoes . 
 Nothing unusual , I ’ m afraid . 
 Good . That ’ s something unusual . 
 Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident . 
 Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work . 
 Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance . 
 His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house . 
 He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is . 
 I hope so , too . 
 Hello , Mr . Clark . You ’ re early for lunch . It ’ s only eleven o ’ clock . 
 What would you like today ? 
 And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives . 
 Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . 
 Have you ? 
 Just two blocks away , in that tall building . 
 My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . 
 I ’ m Chen Ming . 
 I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . 
 No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . 
 Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer . 
 She ’ s a librarian at the public library . 
 Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer . 
 Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him . 
 Colorado . 
 Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot . 
 Yes . Mostly to England and France . 
 Mm ? 
 Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? 

You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . 
 Luckily that was nothing serious . 

Elaine ’ s back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ? 
 How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable . 
 I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... 
 Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday . 
 That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? 
 You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . 
 Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . 
 Engaged ? 
 Are you crazy ? 

How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? 

Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ? 
 Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ? 
 Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it ! 
 Neither can I . 
 Don ’ t worry . Everyone knows you ’ re getting your feet wet . I ’ ll show you how . I bet you ’ ll be proficient at this in five minutes . 
 Relax . I can hold my own . Now , point your skis toward the bottom of the hill . Easy does it ! 
 Here . I ’ ll just give you a little push ... 
 There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ... 

Labor is an abundant resource here . 

This paper absorbs water so quickly ! 

Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . 
 Out ? What do you mean out ? 
 Dad and mom ? 
 You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? 

Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? 
 I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? 
 Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same . 

Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come . 
 Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . 

So do you think I can take it ? 
 I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter 
 Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . 
 In that case , I ’ m right behind you . 
 Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow . 
 Yeah . Thanks . And have fun ! 
 All right , if that would make you happy . 
 Well , nothing really serious . 
 Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... 
 Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . 
 Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... 
 Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . 
 Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... 
 Who ’ s that boy ? 
 The one next to the telephone . 
 I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . 
 How do you do ? Mr . Barker . 
 Oh , Parker with a P ? 
 Er ... I ’ m Barker . 
 Yes , with a B . 
 Thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 Do you really ? 
 Well , I just think he deserves it . 
 Yes , she is . 
 No , she is an English teacher . 
 You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother . 
 I had a bad day yesterday . 
 I went to the library and lost my bag . 
 I went back for it . But it was already gone . 

What ’ s the date today ? 
 Right . What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ? 
 How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now . 
 OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . 
 I'll try to speak more clearly . 
 To tell you the truth , it was completely accidental . 
 Hi , Jim . 
 He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy . 
 Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . 
 It'll take us all some time to get used to the change . 
 That sounds great ! 
 I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . 
 Is your waist any better ? 
 I ’ m glad you are getting better . 
 Then when will you be back again ? 
 I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . 

Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? 

What kind of gas does this car take ? 
 I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ? 
 That is the pump you are in front of . 
 It is the most expensive . 
 Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little . 
 I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here . 

Are you still working day and night ? 

Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . 
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! 
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 
 Great play ! 
 Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! 
 Well , I have the day off from work . 
 Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . 
 Sure . Any time . 
 Alright , no problem . 
 Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? 
 That's a gay bar . 
 I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? 
 Why doesn't he meet us outside ? 
 Yeah , but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? 
 I just wouldn't be comfortable . 
 No , never . 
 Well ... 
 No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before . 
 Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . 
 Fine . 
 I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . 
 Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . 
 So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . 
 About what ? 
 Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . 
 No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . 
 Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? 
 Alright , let's go . 

Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 
 Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . 

Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! 
 Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! 
 That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . 
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 
 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? 
 So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? 
 Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . 
 Laura ... 

Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 
 What was that ? 
 Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . 
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! 
 Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . 
 Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 
 ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... 
 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . 
 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? 
 I made strawberry shortcake . 
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 
 Do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? 
 Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? 
 What happened ? 
 I'll go with you . Where is she ? 
 Is she alright ? 
 Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . 
 Ok . Just call me if you need anything then . 

Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 It wasn't cold out this morning . 
 Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . 
 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 

It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? 
 What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 That doesn't sound pretty . 
 Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . 
 I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! 
 That sounds like fun . 
 English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . 
 Sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . 
 I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . 
 It's his 50th birthday . 
 Sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? 
 Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . 
 Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . 
 Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . 
 Say hello to your friends for me . 
 Bye ! 
 It's Beethoven . Do you like it ? 
 I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . 
 Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? 
 What kind of music do you prefer then ? 
 Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . 
 How long have you been in to pop music , then ? 
 Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . 
 Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . 
 Yes , it's one of my hobbies . 
 What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . 
 I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . 
 He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . 
 Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . 

what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? 
 I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . 
 yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 
 in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
 no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? 
 some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . 

What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? 
 Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . 
 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 
 Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . 
 Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . 
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . 
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . 
 well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . 
 if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . 
 yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . 
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . 
 to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
 Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . 
 I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? 
 Wow , that must have really been scary . 
 Have you ever experiences a flood ? 
 That sure didn't last long ! 
 I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . 
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . 
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . 
 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . 
 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . 
 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . 
 that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . 
 I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . 
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 
 I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i 
 If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . 
 The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . 

Good morning . I ’ m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ? 
 First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . 
 How do you research your books ? 
 I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! 
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? 
 Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . 
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . 
 I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it 
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 
 You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - 

You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? 
 How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? 
 I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . 
 Are you a member of his fan club ? 
 Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? 
 Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? 
 I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . 
 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
 Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea 
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves 

Guess what ? I've got great news ! 
 Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? 
 Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . 
 She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . 
 It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . 
 Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! 
 I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you . 
 Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? 
 Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . 
 Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . 
 Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? 
 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? 
 It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . 
 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 
 I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! 
 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 
 I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . 
 Women have often played an important role in british history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british 
 There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . 
 There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . 

Are you an art aficionado ? 
 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . 
 Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . 
 I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . 
 Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . 
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 
 I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 
 Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 

How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? 
 Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? 
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
 I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . 
 I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . 
 It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . 
 To each their own ! 
 Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? 
 That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? 
 What do you have in mind ? 
 Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? 
 Not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? 
 Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . 
 It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . 
 Sounds good . I'll see you then ! 
 Yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . 
 Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 
 Did you read the books before you watched the movies ? 
 Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . 
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . 
 That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . 
 Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 
 Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . 
 Should I take my shoes off ? 
 This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? 
 Sure , what do you have ? 
 I'll have a glass of red wine please . 
 So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? 
 Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? 
 That's too bad.They ' re such good company . 

Which language do you speak ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . 
 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 

Let ’ s play a game ! 
 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 
 Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! 
 Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! 
 Not funny . 
 I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve 
 Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout 
 It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some 
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . 
 This is gonna be a great barbecue ! 
 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 
 Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you 
 Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be 
 The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? 

Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! 
 Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... 

Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . 
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? 

I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . 
 Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . 
 What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . 
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 

Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 
 Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . 
 That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! 

Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 
 January 5th . 
 That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 

What are you doing ? 
 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 
 I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . 
 Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . 
 All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! 

Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . 
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . 
 One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . 

Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
 Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
 Yes ... 
 Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . 
 Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having . 
 Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . 
 I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . 
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . 

Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca 
 Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes 
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some 
 Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! 
 Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! 
 This next one is from Betty . 
 One more from Carla . 
 OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? 

I've come to say goodbye . 
 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
 You need a babysitter . 
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
 Why not ? 
 I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I have plenty of gas . 
 So what can we do ? 
 Alright . That's a good idea . 
 Days ? 
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 
 Okay , I'll follow your advice . 
 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 
 Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
 Okay . Check you later . 
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! 
 All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! 
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . 
 Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! 
 What is a tornado warning ? 
 Really ? In New Berlin ? 
 I understand . They think a tornado might come . 
 And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . 
 It's scary . 
 What do you mean " a loud train " ? 
 But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 
 Have you seen a lot of them ? 
 Did it hit their house ? 
 What were they doing when you called ? 
 That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? 

And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . 
 Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . 
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . 
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . 

OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . 
 That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . 
 The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot 
 I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . 
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 

Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? 
 You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? 
 It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? 
 In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . 
 It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... 
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
 Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? 
 Yes , I ’ m a singer . 
 Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? 
 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 
 I ’ Ve been playing computer games . 
 It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
 My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . 
 Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . 

You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! 
 I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . 
 Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . 
 Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! 
 What ! 
 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 
 If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! 
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 

You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . 
 Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . 
 You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . 
 As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . 
 What is that ? 
 Cool ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 
 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! 
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 
 I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . 
 Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? 

Can we talk ? 
 You know what I mean . 
 I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... 
 I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . 
 Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... 
 You do ? 
 Oh , I love you too ! 
 Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . 
 Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? 
 I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . 
 Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . 
 You have always been so soft , Dave ! 
 Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! 
 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 From China . 
 It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . 
 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? 
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 

... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . 
 What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? 
 It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? 
 You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! 

It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! 
 It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . 

Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? 
 Oh ... why ? 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! 
 I ... I ... 
 Of course . Are you a new member here ? 
 Welcome . My name is Johnson . 
 Do you have any experience using weights ? 
 Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . 
 Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . 
 No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . 
 Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . 
 Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . 
 So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . 
 Are you alright ? Can you do more ? 
 That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . 
 We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? 

I think I'm going to go home . 
 I know , but it's 12 
 Three or four o'clock ? 
 I never stay out that late . That's too late . 
 Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? 
 What is that they're doing on the couch ? 
 Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? 
 But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . 
 Really ? 
 I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? 
 I don't want to . 
 I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . 
 I thought a university was for studying . 
 Alright . I'll have another drink . 
 Why don't you run outside ? 
 Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . 
 Wait for me a minute . I'll go over to the gym too . 
 Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . 
 What do you mean by that ? Everyone can exercise ! 
 No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . 
 Are you laughing at me ? 
 Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . 
 So I need to do something too . 
 I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? 
 What ? 

I am kind of nervous . 
 I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . 
 Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . 
 Really ? 
 Alright . But will we sing ? 
 I don't know the words . 
 And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? 
 Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? 
 It doesn't sound like an English word . 
 Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . 

Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . 
 I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . 
 I am worried about the meeting this morning . 
 Really ? 
 I'm afraid I was too rude . 
 Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . 
 Really ? 
 But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . 
 Yes . And he is the president of the company . 
 I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . 
 Good . Thank you for telling me this . 

Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? 
 Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? 
 Yes . And you ? 
 Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . 
 No , really . I can only hear a little accent . 
 Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . 
 No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . 
 Yes . Why not ? 
 Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? 
 I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . 
 No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? 

So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . 
 He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . 
 We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . 
 Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . 
 Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . 
 Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . 
 Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . 
 It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . 
 That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . 

Bye , mom ! 
 OK . Bye ! 
 Alright . See ya ! 
 Ok , see you after school ... 
 Mom ? 
 I ... I can ’ t breathe . 
 I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . 
 Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . 
 Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . 
 I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . 
 Hmm . I hope not . 
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 
 What was that ? 
 And that ? 
 What was that ? 
 Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 

Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . 
 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . 
 What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . 
 Yeah , yeah , whatever . 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 
 What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! 
 Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! 
 Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . 
 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . 
 I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 
 Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! 
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire . 
 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 
 You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . 
 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . 
 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 
 Well , here we go again . 
 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
 What are you so excited about ? 
 What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . 
 There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . 
 No , how much is it worth ? 
 Whoa . 
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 
 Right . 
 Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . 
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . 

Who are those guys ? 
 Oh . 
 All right ! 
 Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . 
 Which team do you think will win ? 

What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
 How hard is the climb ? 
 What did you do last week ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . 
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! 

Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 

Hey man , what do you have on tap ? 
 Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud . 
 Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . 
 Wait ... What ! 
 Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . 
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
 Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . 

Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? 
 I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough . 
 It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning . 
 I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? 
 O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . 
 See you . 
 And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today , as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup ! 
 That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside . 
 Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul ! Oh no , Did , the goalkeeper , has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick ! 

Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? 
 I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... 
 Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . 

... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . 
 Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! 
 That ’ s my index finger ! 
 Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . 
 That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! 
 Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading 
 You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! 
 No ! The egg came first ! 
 Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . 
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 
 What an amazing goal ! 
 You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . 
 At the drop of a hat . 
 Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . 
 When pigs fly ! 
 I just took a shot in the dark . 
 Over my dead body you are ! 
 Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
 Not at all , I was totally in the dark . 
 What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . 
 Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . 
 Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? 
 Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . 
 Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . 
 Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . 
 Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! 
 I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it . 
 I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times . 
 Yes , it was really stupid . 
 It was fifty dollars for a half-hour . 
 What do you mean ? It's expensive ! 

This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? 
 What are you planning to do today ? 
 Have you done windsurfing before ? 
 Can you take a little advice from a friend ? 
 Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . 
 Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . 

You are too picky . 
 Which guy ? 
 I can't see him . Where ? 
 Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... 
 Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? 
 I can't do that . 

I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . 
 I don't want to lose all my money . 
 I guess you're right . 
 Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . 
 I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . 
 Okay . 
 Maybe 500 dollars . 
 I don't want people to think I'm stingy . 

Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? 
 No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . 
 Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . 
 Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . 
 This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? 
 Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . 
 Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . 

So how much should I gamble ? 
 Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? 
 I want games that are all luck . 
 Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice . 
 Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . 
 Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . 

... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? 
 You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? 
 He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . 
 But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! 
 No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... 

Why did she do that ? 

Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! 
 Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? 
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? 
 Hold on a sec , his name is David ? 
 That ’ s my brother ! 
 Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . 
 Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! 
 Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? 
 Ahahah ... really ? 
 Hey , I offered last year ... 

Has the game started yet ? 
 Who's winning ? 
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! 
 You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! 
 Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! 
 Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 
 That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? 
 Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . 
 What is it ? 

So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . 
 Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . 
 But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! 
 Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? 
 Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! 
 Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? 
 I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . 
 Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? 
 Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! 
 Oh ... I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere . 
 Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ? 

What do you want to do tomorrow night ? 
 It's Friday . We should go party . 
 Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . 
 Yes ? Why not ? 
 They aren't alcoholic ! 
 So where should we go ? 
 You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . 
 It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . 
 It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? 
 No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! 
 Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . 
 Maybe . 
 Oh , hey ... 
 Actually , my office is right around the corner . 
 Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . 
 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 

I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? 
 What were the schools like ? 
 But you taught children , yes ? 
 They actually study after school ? 
 Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? 
 Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . 
 But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . 
 Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? 
 Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? 

How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? 
 I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . 
 I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . 
 It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . 
 Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . 
 Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . 
 Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . 
 No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . 
 See you around . 
 Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . 
 That's okay . Better late than never . 
 No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again . 
 You can't judge a book by its cover . 
 The bigger they are , the harder they fall . 
 Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun . 
 Really ? Who did you hear that from ? 

Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? 

I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . 

It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . 
 I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . 
 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . 
 People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . 
 I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . 
 Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . 

I ’ d love to have my own farm . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
 That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . 
 My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . 

What ’ s your city like ? 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 

Is your city a historical place ? 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 
 As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 
 Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . 
 Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . 
 I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . 
 I think there must be . 
 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . 
 No , but we're trying to contact them . 
 I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . 
 There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
 yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . 
 it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . 
 yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . 
 absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . 
 yeah , I can find enough online . 
 thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . 
 Awful . It was a complete waste of time . 
 It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . 
 Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . 
 Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . 
 Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . 
 Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , 

Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink . 
 Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . 
 Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! 
 Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful ! 
 I'm gonna introduce myself . 
 Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . 
 My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . 
 OK , catch you later . 
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . 
 but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . 
 I've fallen in love with my boss . 
 no , of course not . He is still single . 
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
 worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . 
 it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . 

Mike , what are you doing tonight ? 
 I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . 
 Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . 
 They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . 
 Quite a difference , huh ? 
 Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . 

hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came . 
 yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas . 
 oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn 
 oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again . 
 sounds great ! I'll be there . 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 you can ask her out for drink after work . 
 then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . 
 you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . 
 that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . 
 good luck ! 
 yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . 
 yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... 
 almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . 
 yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . 
 that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
 thank you . 

how are you doing , Christopher ? 
 are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 are you available on Sunday ? 
 ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? 
 it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
 we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . 
 do you like surfing ? 
 we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
 you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . 
 we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! 
 when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 
 that's right . Why do you ask ? 
 when are you getting married ? 
 congratulations ! I had no idea . 
 do you like amusement parks ? 
 if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . 
 even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . 
 I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
 it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? 
 really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? 
 maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . 
 he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . 
 anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . 
 no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . 
 so do I . 
 I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! 
 cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . 
 no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . 
 you could try . It would save you a lot of money . 
 if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! 
 let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . 

this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . 
 yes , I mean it . 
 no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . 
 I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . 
 I ’ m sorry . 
 then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . 
 I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . 
 sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
 can't complain . What about you ? 
 I've heard . She looks quite depressed . 
 I heard they were just married for 5 months . 
 yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . 
 maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . 
 that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? 
 I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . 
 actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? 
 what kind of music do you prefer then ? 
 not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . 
 how long have you been in to pop music , then ? 
 not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . 
 well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . 
 yes , it's one of my hobbies . 
 I don't think so . Why ? 
 sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ? 
 will there be a lot of people there ? 
 who else is going to be there ? 
 I know your sister . She's very nice . 
 what time is it going to start ? 
 should I bring anything ? 
 I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod . 

hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? 
 you're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink . 
 whatever you prefer . 
 just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? 
 I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . 
 one glass of red wine coming up ! 
 there's just going to be 6 of us tonight . 
 Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . 
 I think there's someone at the door . 

Hi , chary , are you busy this evening ? 
 what are you doing ? 
 how old is he today ? 
 well , wish him a happy birthday for me . 
 I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . 
 sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . 
 sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? 
 yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . 
 likewise . See you later . 

how's it going ? 
 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . 
 the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . 
 a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . 
 I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . 
 in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . 
 what would you do if you were me ? 

so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? 
 I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ? 
 have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ? 
 it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . 
 sure , would you like to see them ? 
 I have a Canon SLR . 
 I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ? 
 have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? 
 yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . 
 how about at 11:00 ? 

why are you in such a good mood today ? 
 I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? 
 so what did you do about it yesterday ? 
 you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! 
 weren't you scared ? 
 so have you cured your fear of heights ? 
 I'm impressed . 
 well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . 
 I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . 

what sort of music do you like ? 
 so , you're into 80s music then ? 
 I like alternative music . 
 to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . 
 I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? 
 there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . 
 that's too bad . Maybe another time . 
 I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? 
 there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . 

do you need a hand ? 
 are you sure you don't need any help ? 
 I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! 
 yes . What about you ? 
 oh , I guess I'll let you through then . 
 that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? 
 I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . 
 thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ? 

Did you enjoy that new movie ? 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 
 What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . 
 Doesn't sound promising . 
 If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . 

excuse me ; is this seat taken ? 
 thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you . 
 the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? 
 global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere . 
 no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago . 
 I'm from China . What about you ? 
 did you enjoy it ? 
 it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . 
 yes , have you read it ? 
 well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . 
 likewise . Bye ! 
 Hi , Bill , this is my new car . 
 You like it , huh ? 
 It is special , isn't it ? 
 Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . 
 Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Jump in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , it costed a bundle alright . 
 Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . 
 We are on the high way . I'm the * * . 
 It's a great feeling . 
 Thanks , Daisy . 
 Don't mention it , let's go in . 
 She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? 
 You can ! With a little practice . 
 I think he's hot too . 
 Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . 
 Good for you , Leslie ! 
 Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall . 
 He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . 
 Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night 
 This is no laughing matter , Nick . 
 He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer . 

Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry . 
 True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? 
 Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ? 
 It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go ! 
 This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . 
 Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig . 
 Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed . 
 You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . 
 I'm not surprised . 
 My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . 
 I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! 
 He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . 
 You can say that again . 
 Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . 

good morning ! 
 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! 
 I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . 
 well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . 
 for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 
 Ok , I'll try that . 
 just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . 
 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
 you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 
 yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . 
 great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? 
 why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . 
 come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much . 
 the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . 
 I'll take care of it . 
 no problem . 
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . 
 well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . 
 you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? 
 I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! 
 you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . 
 that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! 

what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset . 
 oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . 
 come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? 
 not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . 
 there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . 
 yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like . 

hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? 
 oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? 
 wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! 
 perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . 
 we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . 
 no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . 

What a nice day ! 
 great , let's go ! 
 exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... 
 why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . 
 never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? 
 ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . 

hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 
 it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . 
 yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 
 you mean visit a factory ? 
 good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
 really ? What do the companies do that for ? 
 oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
 do we need an appointment beforehand ? 

excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ? 
 I must have taken a wrong turn . 
 and then ? 
 thanks a lot . 
 by the way , how long does it take ? 
 I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? 
 great ! Thank you ! 

it's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 is she American ? 
 so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 
 sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 
 that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 
 good luck ! 

hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? 
 did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? 
 what else did you see ? 
 you must have had a great time . 
 yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . 
 that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 

Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . 
 yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 
 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 

who are you writing a letter to ? 
 OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . 
 well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . 
 just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . 
 shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? 
 it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . 
 I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . 
 and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . 
 what would you do without me ? 

Have you heard about the new iPhone ? 
 I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . 
 how big is a shuffle iPod ? 
 how many gigs of music can it hold ? 
 how much do they cost ? 
 you're right , that's not bad at all . 
 I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . 
 that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . 
 I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . 
 not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . 
 sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . 
 it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? 
 can you also take still photos with this ? 
 how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? 
 that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? 
 how does that compare with other models ? 
 I guess you can't have everything , can you ? 
 not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . 
 I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . 
 actually , I've got a wireless connection . 
 I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . 
 No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? 
 what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? 
 what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . 
 cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . 

You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! 
 it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! 
 no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . 
 ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " 
 just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . 
 ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . 
 oh . It's actually all rather personal . 
 ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " 
 didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . 
 men ! 
 yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? 
 yes , I guess I should try to use it . 
 of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? 
 sure . Here you go . 
 no , why ? 
 oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . 
 no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . 
 I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? 
 how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? 
 let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! 
 I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . 
 the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! 
 how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? 
 I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! 
 it's a deal . 
 yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? 
 I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . 
 let's get started with this game then . 

how did your interview go ? 
 if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? 
 will you get a pay-raise , too ? 
 that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? 
 what kinds of questions did she ask you ? 
 the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? 
 those are good answers . How did she react ? 
 what do you think about her as a boss ? 
 you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! 
 when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . 

could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? 
 first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? 
 I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . 
 I could really use a 5 % rise . 
 listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . 
 that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? 
 that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . 

do you mind if I sit here ? 
 don't I know you ? 
 you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! 
 I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? 
 that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? 
 I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . 
 yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . 
 it is , but it's very rewarding . 
 I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! 

hello . Where are you headed today ? 
 do you have your passport with you ? 
 fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . 
 would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 let me see here ... yes , there's one left . 
 alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 
 if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? 
 you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! 
 oh . 
 sure . 
 the train ? Will I be flying back then ? 
 will the train be very crowded ? 
 when is the first meeting then ? 
 where will I be staying ? 
 that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? 

the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? 
 where are you planning on going ? 
 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . 
 personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . 
 it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 
 maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . 
 since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . 

Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . 
 She sure knows how to strut her stuff . 
 And look out she's dressed . 
 No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . 
 I think you've lost it . 
 I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . 
 At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . 
 it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! 
 because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 
 that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
 oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . 
 no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! 
 we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . 
 of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 

hi , how are you doing ? 
 same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? 
 oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 
 it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . 
 well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . 
 oh , that's too short-lived . 
 I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . 
 in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . 

Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? 
 Then let's go in . 
 I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . 
 Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? 
 What's he trying to pull anyway . 
 Maybe you should start seeing someone else . 

more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . 
 oh , why ? 
 I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . 
 I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . 
 what do you mean ? 
 a left girl ? What's that ? 
 you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . 

if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? 
 not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . 
 you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
 oh , how did you deal with it ? 
 oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? 
 like what ? 
 Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . 
 so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . 

it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? 
 but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . 
 sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . 
 I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . 
 bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . 
 maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make 

hi , betty ! 
 pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . 
 well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don 
 indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . 
 true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . 
 yeah it is . 
 great . My family came to visit me . 
 my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . 
 I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? 
 interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 do you get along well with each other ? 
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family . 

this party rocks ! 
 I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! 
 oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? 
 I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . 
 come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . 
 all right . But I think you ought to move soon . 
 I can see five other guys eying her up . 
 good luck ! 
 sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . 
 well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . 
 well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once . 
 to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were 
 well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per 

ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? 
 what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? 
 really ? What is it ? 
 I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? 
 just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free . You know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . I look forward to seeing you soon ! 
 thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! 

hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . 
 actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? 
 really impressive . These two genres are totally different . 
 how often do you go to the cinema ? 
 movie salon ? where is that ? 
 is it good ? 
 really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . 

hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . 
 yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 
 that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . 
 alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 
 that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . 
 not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . 
 really ? I haven't heard of it . 
 Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! 
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . 
 a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . 
 I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 
 really ? Where did you hear that ? 
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . 
 that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . 
 well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . 
 well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b 
 it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 you're dancing so well . 
 when did you learn to dance ? 
 it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 thank you for the dance . 
 ok . 
 why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . 
 I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . 
 I have no idea . 
 well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . 
 my IQ score is slightly above average . 
 maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . 
 you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . 
 let's go ! 
 oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . 
 would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . 
 oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . 
 you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants 
 well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . 

what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? 
 why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? 
 what's the puzzle ? 
 oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . 
 oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . 
 definitely . 
 don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . 
 sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 
 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . 
 well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . 
 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t 
 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . 
 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b 
 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . 
 thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? 
 now let's have one together . 
 let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . 
 cheese ... 
 yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . 
 let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . 
 that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . 
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . 
 don't forget to keep the seat belt on . 
 yes ! 
 oh , you have too wild of an imagination . 
 no . please sit down . 
 are you also going to Beijing ? 
 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 
 really ? What did you think ? 
 was it that crowded ? 
 oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . 
 thank you very much ! 
 Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . 
 Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . 
 I was in New York for a wedding . 
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
 how have you been ? 
 yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? 
 well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? 
 yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . 
 I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
 it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . 
 no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . 
 no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . 
 that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . 
 not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . 

you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? 
 but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . 
 can't you hang out with them , too ? 
 maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 
 it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . 
 she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . 
 I still think you two should try to patch things up . 

what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? 
 three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! 
 were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 
 did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 
 that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 
 you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 

Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 that's what friends are for . 
 thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . 
 she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . 
 yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . 
 oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? 
 then who will you meet tonight ? 
 really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? 
 I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . 
 hey , Isabelle ... 
 yes , I am the guy . 
 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! 
 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
 I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . 
 waiting for someone . 
 you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . 
 well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . 
 yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
 I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . 

what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? 
 but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 
 so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? 
 how about drinking soda ? 
 that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 
 how do you know so much about food and dieting ? 

I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . 
 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
 yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . 
 no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . 
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
 no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . 
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
 just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . 
 that sounds good . 

you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . 
 do you feel ok ? 
 why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . 
 you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . 
 Zach , what's that on your arm ? 
 it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? 
 I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . 
 we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . 

do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . 
 I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . 
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 
 the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . 
 shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 
 that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . 
 are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 
 I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
 that depends . What is it ? 
 I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . 
 let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . 
 that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? 
 see you then ! 
 of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
 we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . 
 it can't be that bad . 
 really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . 
 ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? 
 has anything else happened to you ? 
 well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 
 sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . 
 I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . 
 I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . 
 the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . 
 it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . 
 at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . 

Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ? 
 OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? 
 I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? 
 And he looks like a typical jog . 
 Ah-ha , I thought so . 
 What did you mean ? 
 That's right . 

have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? 
 it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through 
 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro 
 my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . 
 old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . 
 no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! 
 no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a 
 It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . 
 She made another white crack about my clothes . 
 Of course , I am sure . 
 Just how am I supposed to do that ? 
 I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . 
 I am not . she is no picnic . 
 Thanks , Serena . 
 There are 15 people in my family . 
 15 people . 
 Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . 
 Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . 
 Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis 
 My aunts and uncles are all teachers . 
 I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . 
 I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . 
 My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . 
 everything's great . I've just returned from my office . 
 sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . 
 yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . 
 a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . 
 I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . 
 you bet it ! 
 Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . 
 My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . 
 No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho 
 Of course there'll be a room for you ! 
 Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . 
 It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . 
 It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? 
 We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! 

Can you play baseball with me today ? 
 Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? 
 Can I help you pack ? 

I haven't danced for a long time . 
 We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance . 
 I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ? 
 Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? 
 Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . 
 A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! 
 Yes , I did . 
 Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . 
 How did it finish ? 
 It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . 
 No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . 
 Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . 
 OK.See you on Today . 
 You too.Thanks for dropping in . 
 Good morning , Tom.How are you ? 
 Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? 
 I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run . 
 After a while , crocodile . 
 Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . 
 Just fine . How is everything with you ? 
 I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . 
 That ’ s a deal . 
 Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . 
 The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . 
 I ’ m pretty happy living there . 
 I ’ Ve been to all of them . 
 The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World . 
 I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ? 
 Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while . 
 Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry . 
 Take good care of yourself , Mary . 
 Bye-bye ! 
 sure , go ahead . 
 yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . 
 can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . 
 now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . 
 well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . 
 then , you're probably addicted . 
 sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . 
 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . 
 at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an 
 it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . 
 sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . 

not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! 
 yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . 
 addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
 absolutely . 
 yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . 
 yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . 

Do Mona and Jim need a new house ? 
 Does Jim make a lot of money ? 
 Does Jim need to make more money ? 
 What do they need all that money for ? 
 Do they have any children ? 
 What does Jim like to do ? 
 What does Mona like to do ? 
 Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . 
 Politics can be an expensive hobby . 
 Politics is a hard game to play . 

what date is it today ? 
 look at the girls in the street . They all have bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? 
 did you have a fight with Jack ? 
 come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . 
 is that your phone ? 
 wow ! good timing . 
 come on ! three's a crowd ! 
 just go ! it's Valentine's Day ! 
 I didn't like it . Not a bit . I couldn't stand the music . Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep . 
 I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie . 
 Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers . 
 Well , I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You ' re more important than the movie . 
 Any time . 
 It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . 
 When's he coming ? 
 Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? 
 Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? 
 Are they going to stay here with us ? 
 Mother , may we have a party ? 
 Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . 
 Why ? 
 Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? 
 I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . 
 I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . 
 Yes , I played with Tony and John . 
 We all went swimming . 
 No , we aren't . We're going to help Mr Smith to plant some flowers . 
 Yes , we are . We can neither play football nor do our homework today . 
 Yes , we certainly are . But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do . 
 Would you ? I wouldn't . 
 Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . 
 Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? 
 What would you do after that ? 
 It doesn't sound very exciting . 
 I'd be happy if I got a rise . 
 Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . 
 I'll have a pint of the best . 
 All right . Make it a double , will you ? 
 I'm going to stay in the city . 
 I'm going to work with my father at the store . In the evening , I'll read books.On weekends , I'll go to the beach with my family . 
 No , but I can learn . What are you going to do this summer ? 
 I've never gone to camp . What do you do there ? 
 That sounds wonderful . 
 I think he's going to the mountains with his parents . 
 You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I'm going to be a clerk . 
 He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types . 
 A-what ? 
 Good gracious ! What's that ? 
 I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . 
 Kobe Bryant , of course . 
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 
 indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . 
 who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . 
 well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 
 Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . 
 Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . 
 Certainly . 
 Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? 
 Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? 
 What does he do when it rains ? 

Hi , Fanny . 
 Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . 
 What happened ? 
 Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? 
 You have got a great mother . 
 That sounds good ! 
 Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . 
 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
 Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k 
 yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . 

Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 Avril Lavigen ! 
 yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... 
 not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . 
 yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . 
 she looked sweeter than her pictures . 
 no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . 

Good evening , John . 
 How are you doing ? 
 Nothing special . 
 Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date . 
 All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch . 

Julie , what's on the tube ? 
 yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . 
 it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . 
 oh , what is it ? 
 oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . 
 I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . 

have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 
 what ? 
 what is it ? 
 that makes you feel uncomfortable ? 
 perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . 
 well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . 
 yeah . 

hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? 
 why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
 Really ? What's the series about ? 
 it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . 
 really ? that's interesting ! 
 OK , I'll give it a go . 
 sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . 
 to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . 
 certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch 
 anything strang about that ? 
 oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . 
 it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . 
 I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . 
 nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing . 
 you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . 

I heard you received a prize for you book . 
 congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . 
 what was the prize ? 
 that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? 
 I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! 
 I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? 
 I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . 
 really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . 
 I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . 
 that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . 

do you like animals ? I really like dogs . 
 why ? I think cats are ok . 
 I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . 
 I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . 
 really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . 
 not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me . 
 there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something 
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ? 
 ok , i choose luckies . 

I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . 
 I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . 
 I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . 
 that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? 
 I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . 

I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . 
 How might you spend the weekend . 
 I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf . 
 Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . 
 Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . 
 I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . 
 yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . 
 really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . 
 dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? 
 I had some good financial news yesterday too . 
 no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . 

How are the children doing at sport ? 
 He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? 
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? 
 How are they at swimming ? 
 Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . 
 I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . 

how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ? 
 what do you have for breakfast ? 
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 
 how do you spend your afternoons ? 

I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . 
 Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . 
 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . 
 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . 
 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . 

Which sports are popular in your country ? 
 Do many people like tennis ? 
 In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . 
 I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . 
 There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . 
 It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . 
 The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . 
 I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . 

Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? 
 Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . 
 What is the international community doing to help ? 
 How many countries have been affected ? 
 I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran . 
 Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? 

I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . 
 So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . 
 We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . 
 I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . 

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . 
 What methods do you use to conserve water ? 
 I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . 
 What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . 
 That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . 
 I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . 
 Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . 
 Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . 
 Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . 
 We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . 
 I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an 
 Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? 
 I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . 
 I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . 
 Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a 
 It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
 I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
 I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? 
 What do you do in winter ? 
 I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . 
 Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? 

I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . 
 The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . 
 Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . 
 Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? 
 What a good idea ! 
 In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . 
 What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . 
 Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? 
 Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . 
 My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . 
 As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny . 
 My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . 
 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . 
 The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . 
 There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . 

Is there a lot of crime in your city ? 
 It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . 
 Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . 
 That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . 
 I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . 
 No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? 
 Isn ’ t it really cold there ? 
 I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . 
 What do the Romans do ? 
 In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I envy them the sun . 
 I certainly do . 
 They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? 
 Really ? How much does it cost to fly to Rome ? 

Hello , Jim . Where are you going ? 
 No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me . 
 Do you go to the cinema a lot ? 
 Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? 
 Oh , does she ? That's convenient . 
 Don't you like the sea ? 
 I'm going to stay at home . 
 No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . 
 I haven't played chess for a long time . 
 Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . 
 Not really , but once I won a prize . 
 My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . 
 Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? 
 What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? 
 How many did you use to take ? 
 Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? 
 I'm sure you did . 
 He was quite right . 

Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day ! 
 It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! 
 Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . 
 Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! 
 Ok , you could borrow one of mine . 
 No problem . Here it is . 
 I'm not certain . Do you know ? 
 In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ? 
 Who invented the electric light bulb ? 
 Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ? 
 Ask me a question now . 
 That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ? 
 Yes , isn't it . 
 It's beautiful 75 degrees . 
 Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . 
 I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . 

Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ? 
 Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ? 
 I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . 
 For a short time . One of the engines caught fire . 
 He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . 
 Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . 
 Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? 
 I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? 
 Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? 
 You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? 
 What sort of clothes does he wear ? 
 Perhaps that had something to do with it . 
 It's possible , isn't it ? 
 Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . 
 I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! 
 Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . 
 I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . 
 sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . 
 I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . 
 I think there must be . 
 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . 
 no , but we're trying to contact them . 
 I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . 
 there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
 Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . 
 Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . 
 That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . 
 Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . 
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . 
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . 
 well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . 
 if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . 
 yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . 
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . 
 to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
 Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . 
 No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? 
 Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . 
 Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet . 

We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? 

Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest . 
 Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now . 

I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home . 

I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ? 

Where is my contract ? 

You know them ? 

Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? 

Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia . 
 They ’ re people I met during the trip . That ’ s the ship we traveled on . 
 That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ? 
 That ’ s right . 
 Guess ! 
 That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . 
 My wife didn ’ t like it ! 
 Hello , George . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Paris in the Spring . 
 Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ? 
 Paris in the spring , eh ? 
 Just like dear old London ! 
 He is the guy I was telling you about . 
 I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . 
 That must be Conrad Reeves . 
 No , He must be her fourth or fifth . 
 She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . 
 She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . 
 Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . 
 I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me . 
 All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co 

Where do you come from ? 
 What's the climate like in your country ? 
 Which seasons do you like best ? 

What seems to be the problem ? 
 What ? You've got to be kidding me ! 
 Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . 
 I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? 
 I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . 

I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? 
 Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
 I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? 
 It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . 

Where do you come from ? 
 What's the climate like in your country ? 
 What's the weather like in spring ? 
 What's it like in summer ? 
 Is it cold or warm in autumn ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 

Is my car ready yet ? 
 It's LF 312 G . 
 I bought it here three days ago . 
 Have your mechanics finished yet ? 
 Well , it was my car . 
 That's right . I drove it into a lamp post . Can your mechanics repair it ? 

Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Harry ? 
 Will you travel by sea or by air ? 
 It ’ s cheaper , isn ’ t it ? 
 I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves . 

I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day . 
 It's a small blue case and it's got a zip . There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it . 
 No , that's not mine . 
 Let me see it . 
 David Hall , 83 , Bridge Street . 
 Here you are . 
 Hey ! 
 This case doesn't belong to me ! You've given me the wrong case ! 
 Yes , he has . He sold it last week . 
 No , not yet . He's still here . He's going to move tomorrow . 
 No . Tomorrow afternoon . I'll miss him . He has always been a good neighbour . 
 When will the new people move into this house ? 
 Will you see Mien today , Janey ? 
 Please give him my regards . Poor Mien ! He didn't want to leave this house . 

Shall I make some coffee , Jane ? 
 It's ready . Do you want any milk ? 
 What about some sugar ? Two teaspoonfuls ? 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Of course . I think there are a few in that box . 
 What a pity ! 
 Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less ! 

Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ? 
 Do you have to water it now ? 
 What a nuisance ! 
 Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ? 
 It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden . 

Are you doing the football pools , Brian ? 
 You always say that , but we never win anything ! What will you do if you win a lot of money ? 
 I don ’ t want a mink coat ! I want to see the world . 
 But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ? 
 It ’ s a pleasant dream , but everything depends on if ! 
 But mine equals yours in economy . 

I hear Fred is a very good student in your class . 
 What do you mean by on the whole . 

What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ? 
 But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . 

Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ? 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better . 
 What fun ! Normally I ’ d love to , but I ’ m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ’ Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King . 
 Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . 
 Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! 
 Oh , hi Mike . I ’ Ve been out of town the last few days . What did you need ? 
 Well , feel free to drop by my office any time . The door ’ s always open . 
 Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . 
 No , that ’ s perfect . We can leave directly from here . 
 I consider the hero's acting is inferior to that of the heroine's . don't you agree ? 

If one is rich , is the happy ? 
 Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? 

Have you any idea of the prices of ruby and diamond ? 
 How do you know that ? 

Honey , where did you buy this skirt ? 
 Nothing . I am just checking . 
 Yeah , we were classmates when I was in university . 
 I will take a rain check . 
 Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer . 
 Really ? Let ’ s hit the road . 
 It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us . 
 He is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story . 
 Come over and chew the fat . We can enjoy to our hearts'content . 
 I ’ m very sorry . 
 That ’ s a secret . I couldn ’ t tell you . 

Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... 

May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . 

Honey . The cottages harmonize well with the landscape.That tourist resort is worth travelling to . 

Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me . 
 Take care of yourself . 
 You are right . My mum must be crazy . 
 Take care ! I will miss you so much . 
 You are right . We ’ re hoping that this is a long-term opportunity , and just a flash in the pan . 
 I dare you to say that again . 
 Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him . 
 OK . I will catch you later . 
 Take it easy . It ’ s no good worrying . You were on your last leg if you keep worrying in this way . 
 Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 
 Really ? I have a weakness for coffee . 
 The buck stops here . 
 I am sorry to hear that , but face the music . 
 Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . 
 I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself . 
 Don ’ t put me on the spot . You know , I can ’ t do that . 
 I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . 
 I will not miss the boat when there is another opportunity again next time . 
 You ’ re welcome . I enjoyed helping you . 
 How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor . 
 Because they are rednecks . 
 That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well . 
 Come on . I stand behind you . 
 No trouble . I enjoyed helping you . 
 No sweat ! Think nothing of it . 
 That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of . 
 All wet.You are such a fool . 
 Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? 
 I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . 
 I want to see you play . Be quick ! 

I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see . 

What ’ s up ? You look so blue . 

How about this opera given by the famous musician ? 

You have been so busy these months . What are you up to ? 

Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ? 

How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly . 

Yo baby , are you satisfied with the costume show in the street ? 

The bracelet is so well suited to you . It looks very nice . 

Honey , how is by you ? 

Did you listen to the weather forecast ? 
 There ’ s a typhoon coming . 
 Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . 
 Whose name did you pick ? 
 Booze ! 

Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . 

Did you hear about Lulu ? 
 She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . 
 No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . 
 Trust me . Everything will go well . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 

We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ? 
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . 

Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ? 
 Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? 
 I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . 
 Let me check.Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 . 
 It ’ s at ... gate 14 . 
 OK , so here ’ s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 ! 

What do you do ? 
 Really ? That ’ s so cool . 
 What station do you work at ? 

Excuse me , do you have any English songs ? 
 Great , thanks . 
 Oh , I see . 
 I usee I would say that would be moving out of my parents ’ house for the first time . 
 Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent . 
 That would definitely be getting a divorce . 
 We just weren't right for each other . 
 The marriage only lasted about a year . 
 Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband . 
 Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ’ t . 
 About 15 years now . 
 I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together . 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents . 
 We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else ! 
 We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father . 
 What about your step-brother's mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? 
 Sounds like it was ment to be . 
 No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet . 
 What's so interesting about it ? 
 What ? How did that happen ? 
 Wow . What does his look like now ? 
 What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? 
 What's he going to do now ? 

You know Iden , I don ’ t know much about you . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Do you get along with your parents now ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What ’ s your current occupation ? 
 Did you always know you wanted to be a writer ? 
 How did you start writing ? 
 Are you writing a book now ? 
 Sounds interesting . 
 My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl 
 For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . 
 No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy 
 That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like 
 I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! 
 That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? 
 You're a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hotpot . 
 Ok , you're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? 
 Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
 No ... 
 That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! 

Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? 
 Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . 
 She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . 
 Not at all . She's actually very athletic . 
 No , but she does wear contact lenses . 
 She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . 
 I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos 
 It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . 
 Yes , even her mom . 
 She's a lot like me . 

Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot . 

How about going to the cinema tonight ? 
 I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . 
 Don't you think it's too bloody ? 

What's your favorite magazine ? 
 What kind of magazine is it ? 
 Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? 
 Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? 
 Oh , I think I should try to read one . 
 Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . 
 I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? 
 I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . 
 Yeah , it sure would . 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Really ? Good luck for them . 
 They're both very well , thanks . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . Why don't you come with me ? 
 It's been nice talking to you . 

Do you want to try the new coffee here ? 

Come on . All of us are waiting for you . 

When will we leave here ? 

I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 

Wish you have a blast . 

Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? 

OK . Everything is in the bag . 

Happy birthday , Jim ! 
 Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . 
 I'm very glad to hear that . 

Sorry , I need a trip to the bog . 

After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . 

Gucci , you look serious . I wish you ’ d let your hair down . 

Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? 

I have a sweet tooth . Chocolate is my favorite . So how about you ? 

I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . 

What's the weather forecast for today ? 
 Any rain ? 
 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
 We can pig out on potato chips and cookies . They are very cheap . 
 Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . 
 Right , drink as much as you can . 
 Cheers ! 
 I will , mom . Don ’ t worry . 
 No problem . Wait a moment . 
 OK . You ’ d better come back in two hours . 
 Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can . 
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! 
 I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers . 
 Oh , I forgot . 
 I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . 
 I ’ m on it ! 
 Probably nothing . 
 Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means . 
 Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . 
 I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . 
 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? 
 doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? 
 did you play a lot of games when you were little ? 
 do you still like playing those games ? 
 everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . 
 no , I prefer to play with people I know . 
 it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . 
 I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! 
 to be honest , I don't really care for either one . 
 I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it . 
 how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ? 
 have you ever seen a live game ? 
 I've never really understood the game . 
 thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ? 
 that's a good idea . 

what did you do last night ? 
 did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? 
 what were the results of the game ? 
 what was the actual score ? 
 really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . 
 what happened ? 
 that explains it . 
 that was the last game before the playoffs . 
 in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? 
 Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . 
 Ok , it's a date then ! 
 Thanks ! We love it . 
 I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! 
 yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? 
 really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? 
 that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? 
 did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? 
 did he survive ? 
 I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . 
 terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . 
 no , what's it about ? 
 she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . 
 I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . 
 did they mention that in the article ? 
 that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . 
 it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! 

did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? 
 yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . 
 they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . 
 did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? 
 Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? 
 I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . 
 I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . 
 thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! 

the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
 on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . 
 I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse 
 it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
 they're related to one another , yes . 
 people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . 
 I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . 
 I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . 
 I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . 
 almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . 
 the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . 
 did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? 
 added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . 
 politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . 

what happened ? Why didn't he win ? 
 how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
 what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
 that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
 regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . 
 let's hope so . 
 there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . 
 the office . Have you watched it ? 
 it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . 
 they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! 
 I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ? 
 there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? 

so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? 
 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . 
 actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . 
 that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 
 quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 
 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 
 why not ? 
 that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . 
 yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . 
 I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 where are you from ? 
 did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? 
 wow , that must have really been scary . 
 have you ever experiences a flood ? 
 that sure didn't last long ! 
 why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . 
 do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? 
 it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . 
 what do you think about abortion ? 
 do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? 
 why not ? It's their children , too . 
 that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . 
 What's that ? 
 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice . 
 Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . 
 That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that . 
 I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . 
 Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 
 Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! 

what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? 
 why not ? 
 it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . 
 I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . 
 perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . 
 that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . 

have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ? 
 you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . 
 it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ? 
 sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now . 
 no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . 
 it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . 
 Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . 

guess what ? I've got great news ! 
 well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? 
 well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . 
 she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . 
 it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . 
 yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! 
 I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you . 
 me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? 
 perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . 
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . 
 I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? 

it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? 
 what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 that doesn't sound pretty . 
 well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . 
 I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! 
 that sounds like fun . 
 English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . 
 not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? 
 have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? 
 that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? 
 what do you have in mind ? 
 isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? 
 not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? 
 Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . 
 it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . 
 sounds good . I'll see you then ! 
 yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . 
 yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 
 did you read the books before you watched the movies ? 
 yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . 
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . 
 that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . 
 actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 
 yes , are you ? 
 you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 No , sir . 
 Good-bye , sir 
 Just so-so.You ' re doing all right ? 
 No thanks . 
 Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view . 

Hello , George ! Haven't seen you for some time.Where have you been ? 
 Very well.Thank you.Did you have a good time there ? 

It was good to see you here , John . 
 Pretty good.Thank you . 
 This is John . 
 I wonder if I can use your bike . 
 Hello , this is David . 

Aren't you Jim Green ? 
 I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor . 

We are through . 
 Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . 
 But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . 
 You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . 
 I don't buy a story . 
 No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . 
 I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single . 
 No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . 
 Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . 

I need to go to the bank . 
 Closed ? Are you kidding ? What is it , some kind of holiday today ? 
 Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day 
 So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember . 
 Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . 

What time is it ? 
 Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty . 
 What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ? 
 You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late . 
 Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family . 
 OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ? 
 I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina . 

Jim . I heard you got a promotion ! 
 Congratulations , guy . 

Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr.Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening.Where do you think I should take them ? 
 That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ? 
 We'll go to the place . Could you book a table for 4 at 7 PM ? 

Good afternoon , Peace restaurant , may I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . What time would you like , sir ? 
 Fine , a reserve a table for two at 8 PM , sir , may I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Berman . and you prefer smoking or non-smoking ? 
 I'll try my best . With a toward to having with this tonight , Mr.Berman . 
 Goodbye , and have a nice day . 
 Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! 
 Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . 
 Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday . 

Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this ! 
 My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September . 

Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl ! 
 We ’ Ve named her Alice after my wife ’ s grandmother . 

Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ’ re getting married . 
 When ’ s the big day ? 

Hi there , Philip . How ’ s everything going ? 
 I don ’ t blame you . You ’ Ve had a busy first week . Take a rest ! 

Personnel . May I help you ? 
 This is she . Paul ? 

You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ’ m headed for the holidays ! 
 You got it ! I ’ m going to spend two fabulous weeks in Hawaii ! 

Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? 
 Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! 

Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! 
 No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! 

I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! 
 Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 

You look really wiped out . 
 Not a good day , I hate to tell you that Mr . Emory wants to see the designs for the Polish Paste Ad tomorrow morning . 

Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! 
 This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches ! 

Hello Mary . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ? 
 Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up . 
 Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now . 
 I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ? 
 Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you . 

Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . 
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . 

How are you wedding plans going ? 
 When will that be ready ? 
 You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . 
 Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 
 Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I think you make the right decision . 
 As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? 
 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 
 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 I ‘ Ve been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 
 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . 
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . 

That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? 
 I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . 
 Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? 
 We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . 
 No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? 
 I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . 
 Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . 
 They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . 
 Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . 
 Yes , she gets along with them quite well . 
 Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . 
 He's 21 . How old is James ? 
 How's your father ? 
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 
 In the same way , probably . 
 I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . 
 Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . 
 Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? 
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 

I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . 
 he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . 
 yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . 
 not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . 
 no , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . 

what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? 
 I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . 
 you can find out from their friends . 
 oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . 
 it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? 

When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 
 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . 
 That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? 
 Did you ? How is he these days ? 
 I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? 
 Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . 
 No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest . 
 Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . 
 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! 
 So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 

Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? 
 If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? 
 I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . 
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 
 Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at helen ’ s . 
 it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . 
 I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . 
 afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . 
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . 
 what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . 
 very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 
 all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up . 
 well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! 
 yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on 
 that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . 
 yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . 
 no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . 
 it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo 
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b 
 most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help 
 I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . 
 she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . 
 I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year 
 Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat 
 Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho 
 I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . 
 Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . 
 Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . 

good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? 
 certainly . For how many people ? 
 I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? 
 yes . That ’ s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time.Could you give me your name please ? 
 yes . Do you intend to order a la carte or will you be having our seafood buffet ? 

Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ? 
 What do you do ? 
 I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ? 
 I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming . 
 Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ? 
 Aren ’ t you sweet . 
 It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . 
 Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . 
 Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
 I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . 
 The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles . 

Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! 
 Where have you been ? 
 How was your flight ? 
 That ’ s too bad . how long was the flight ? 
 Did you have a layover ? 
 Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? 
 Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... 

Hey Eve , how are you ? 
 I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
 Yes . Don ’ t you ? 
 Which class are you working on right now ? 
 Are you in Mrs . Green ’ s class ? 
 Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! 
 Sure . This library is too quiet though . 
 That sounds good . 

Could you tell me your education background ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What degree did you get ? 
 What was your major ? 
 What was you G . P . A ? 
 Do you plan to pursue further education ? 
 When do you think you will do that ? 
 I see . 
 I'm on my way out to a New Year's banquet.How do I look ? Is my make-up ok ? 
 Do your think I should wear a different dress ? 
 Thanks for saying.Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ? 
 Thanks for helping out.Now Im ready , what are you doing tonight ? 
 Sounds fun.Anyone I know ? 
 Sounds like I'm missing out on a good time.Oh , well , there's always next year . 

Do you like cooking ? 
 To be honest , I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning . 
 I would rather do the dishes than cook . 
 let's make a deal . 
 I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook . 
 Fair enough ! 
 We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ’ t been to a game for a few weeks . 
 Nope , lost again . But , it was a good game . 
 I haven ’ t played softball since I was in high school ! 
 Okay . I guess I could give it a try . 
 Oh , she ’ s just fine . She ’ s so grown up now . 
 Four and a half going on twelve ! 
 Yesterday . I was really sorry to see it end . The skiing was terrific ! 
 Sorry to hear that ! But I would definitely recommend this place ! 
 Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! 
 I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? 
 Oh really ? When is it going to start ? 
 Well , I ’ d like to , but I ’ m going to have to look at my schedule . 
 Yes , John . I ’ m on my break . What ’ s going on ? 
 Great , except for my mother-in-law ! Sometimes I think I married her instead of my husband ! How about you ? 
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
 They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
 Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him ! 
 You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it ! 
 Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning . 
 This is a first ! You must have won the lottery . 
 Fine , thank you . There be five of us . The rest will be along shortly . 
 Non-smoking is fine , thank you . 
 Just water , please . 
 I wait , but please bring me some bread . Maybe I'd like to have some appetizer before they get here . Please give me the menu , and let me have a look . 

I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . 
 How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . 
 It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . 
 Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . 
 I just don't trust you any more . 
 Me , too . 
 Nothing . 
 I'd love to , but I don't care for skating very much . 
 I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you . 
 I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart . 
 How about the seaside ? 
 Are you busy on the 24th ? 
 Ok . 
 Why ? It's unfair . How about going dutch ? 
 Oh , come on , I almost forgot . Don't worry about it . I didn't mind picking up the tab last time . 
 Ok , but it's only for this time . 
 It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together . But don't forget the tip , it usually 15 % . 

Hello , Miss , what can I do for you this afternoon ? 
 Yes , it is , busy today . We usually have a lot more clients on the weekend . Would you like to take a sit , and wait for a while , please ? 
 It should be around that , if you like , please for a free to read the magazine while you are wait . 
 Sorry to keep you waiting , Miss . I'll have a dresser Mr.Li is just finish with a client in a moment or two . Would you have a shampoo first ? I'll get it on for you . 

Hello , three-five . 
 I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again . 
 It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes . 
 No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . 

Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better . 
 But I make it . 
 I work hard so I deserve to enjoy , but that costs money . 
 The problem is that I have no idea . I didn't pay attention . 

Hello , who is speaking ? 
 This is her . 
 Really ? What time and where ? 
 Yes , please , I'll need a ride . I'll be waiting for you then . 
 Thank you , see you then . 

How are you feeling , Flora ? 
 What did you watch today ? 
 And next ? 
 I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it . 
 Anything important happened ? 

Wow ! So many students crowded in . More than I excepted , we are lucky to arrive in hour earlier . Or else we definedly have problems to getting good seats . 
 Yeah , I hate sitting in the front row . 
 That would be great . 
 Ok . 
 well , it depends . 
 of course yes . 
 very touching . 
 yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting . 
 it is full of energy . 
 it certainly is . 
 I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias . 
 It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha 
 Not really , i would consider it easy . 
 I really like short stories . 
 Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time . 

You must like to dance , right . 
 Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz 、 rumba and so on . They are quite graceful . 
 Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ? 
 Neither do I . I don't like any kind of modern dances all . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 
 Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? 
 Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too . 

Happy New Year , Rose . 
 Thank you , I will . What are you up to today ? 
 Sure , why not . Sounds like fun . Why are you going to church ? 
 What for ? 

They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears . 
 Really ? I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's . 
 You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ? 
 Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman 
 I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive . 
 Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are . 
 It's this high-tech equipment that doctors my voice a little . Actually , i am tone-deaf . 
 Well , the echo and the stereo system helped a lot . And i know that song very well , so , i didn't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well . 
 Pick the one that you always sing in the shower . 
 Read me the index number ! 
 No . I need a rest ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 You are kidding . What happened ? 
 That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? 
 That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? 

Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ? 
 They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy . 
 Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go 
 Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too . 

Here's some flowers , love . Happy Valentine's Day . 
 This is let you know that I still you after all this years . I knew there are some up and down when I married you , but through at all , you've always been may my Valentine . 
 I don't think I say this enough , but I want to thank you for your kind listen patience , you ' Ve always been there for me . 
 I am so glad we met one another . 
 What a surprise ! Thanks.It ' s beautiful .

 Nothing , son . I'm already very happy . 
 Actually . I prefer we eat at home.We ' ll have more time to catch up that way . 
 Oh , don't mention it . I'm proud of you ! 

Merry Christmas , Bill .

 That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number . 
 Yeah , that would be great . Thanks . 
 Thanks million . 

Haven't run into you for ages ! 
 Really ? 
 Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . 
 They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . 
 I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . 
 I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are .

 Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ’ t it ? 

Long time no see , George !

 Fine.thanks . 
 I'm so happy you remember , please come in and enjoy the party . Everyone's here , I'm sure you have a good time .

 You look great , you are absolutely glowing . 

Don't I know you ? 
 You're Mr.Stevenson , right ? 

Excuse me , are you Mr Williams from America ? 
 I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you . 

Is the girl in red your girlfriend ? 
 Who's she then ? 

What's the name of the girl that has just passed us ? 
 She's so pretty . I'd like to make friends with her . 

Is his father a worker ? 
 No wonder his son is so clever . 
 He's the poor kid's father . 
 Yes , very . 
 Which one do you mean ? 

Who's the champion in this picture ? 
 He's very handsome , I think . 
 The one with a very big nose . 
 OK . 
 Yes , he's holding a bunch of books . 

Here's the picture of my family . 
 OK.She ' s near-sighted , with a pair of glasses on her nose.She is the only one wearing glasses in my family . 
 I am . What can I do for you ? 
 Come on in , please . 
 She's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year . 

Is that boy standing there your brother ? 
 He's really a good player . 

You must be Mr White from Britain . 
 I'm Michael Smith from Eale Corporation.Pleased to meet you . 
 I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? 

Excuse me , haven't we met somewhere before ? 
 Oh , I see.Glad to see you here . 

Do you know who that tall man is ? 
 Do you know where he comes from ? 

I wonder who that man is . 
 The one smoking a cigar . 

Would you like to introduce me to Mr.Johnson ? 
 thanks a lot . 
 She's Betty.She ' s Mr Goldman's niece . 
 Yes , I'll be glad to . 
 Certainly.Let ' s to and meet him now . 

Paul , is this Paul , isn't it ? 
 Small world , isn't it ? 

Look , who's here , Peter ! 
 Just got back.Good to see you ! 

What a surprise we've met here ! 
 I've been in China.Where were you ? 

I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . 
 Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . 

Mary ! 
 What're you doing here ? You live in London , don't you ? 

You may not remember me.My name is Joe Brown . 
 Nice to see you again . 

How do you do ? My name is Beef Hart . 
 Happy to see you . 

Allow me to introduce my self.My name is Jack Black , manager of the company . 
 Pleasure is mine.Here ' s my card . 

Interesting lectures , aren't they ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Charies Ford . 

I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . 
 Come and meet her now . 

Linda , do you know Mr.Green ? 
 Please meet him now . 

Have you met Professor Smith ? 
 Oh , he's my uncle.Come to my house at seven this evening . I'll introduce you to him . 

Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris . 
 Until we meet again . 
 Don't mention it . 
 See you . 
 See you ! 

Thank you very much for your dinner . 
 My wife is expecting me at home . I must be off now.So long ! 

Can't you delay your return a little bit ? 
 Keep in touch then , OK ? 

I'll have to go now . 
 See you . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? 
 Bye ! 
 Yeah . I'm going with Jennie . 
 Thank you . 
 Quite well.thank you.And what about you ? 

Oh , what a pleasant surprise ! Don't you remember me ? 
 Right ! Glad to see you here . 

Hello , Mrs.White ! I'm Anne . 
 Thank you.You ' re so considerate . 
 Good coming . 
 I'd like a pair of shoes , please . 

How are you doing , Jim ? 
 Not too bad . 
 No , I'm Mary . 
 No , I'm in Class There . 
 How do you do ? 
 I'm Mary Smith.Nice to meet you , too . 
 Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting . 

Plastic bags are widely used nowadays . 
 In this aspect , I think , Pater bags have the edge on plastic bags . 
 Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank . 

Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ? 
 Maybe she'll make a famous singer in the future . 

Bob returned from Japan last week . You know that ? 
 I think so , too . 
 Yeah.And I'm going by bus . 
 But both my wife and I prefer taking a bus . 
 Yes , I do . 
 No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus . 
 Yeah , Why ? 
 You can bet on that . 
 You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent . 

Sally , do you really need to go ? 
 But don't forget to give me a ring . 

Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ? 
 I'm really going to miss you.Take care of yourself . 

I'm leaving now , mum . 
 I will.Bye - bye ! 

Have some more tea , George . 
 Have a nice day ! 

Tom , it's time for you to go to bed . 
 Good night . 
 It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown . 
 I look forward to seeing you soon.Goodbye ! 
 Would you stay for another cup of coffee ? 

Both Bob and carl will become somebody in the future.Don ' t you think so ? 
 But Bob is more generous and ready to help . 

Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think . 
 I don't see much difference , anyway . 
 I've heard about it , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . 
 I'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow . 
 I want to . I heard it's going to be really fun . 
 Well , when does the party start ? 
 How many invitations has she given out ? 
 I really want to go , so I hope that she gives me my invite soon . 
 It's no problem . I was really missing you anyway . 
 Why haven't you tried to come see me then ? 
 Doing what ? 
 I would've come to see you sooner , but I've been busy too . 
 I've been working too . 
 I am too . 
 I was told about it already . I'm just waiting for my invitation . 
 I believe that she will give me the invitation today . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year . 
 When exactly does the party start ? 
 Has she given out a lot of invitations yet ? 
 I'm planning on going , but I really need her to give me my invitation . 
 I really missed you a lot . 
 I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me . 
 Tell me what you've been up to . 
 I've been pretty busy myself . 
 I've just been working a lot . 
 I'm glad I did too . 
 I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . 
 My stomach was bothering me . 
 I'm still feeling a little sick . 
 I'd appreciate that . 
 It wasn't all that great . 
 I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . 
 I wasn't all that impressed by the food . 
 The service did not help the situation . 
 I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . 
 I had to . I was missing you a lot . 
 So , why haven't you visited me ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 I've also been busy . 
 Basically , I've been working too . 
 So am I . 
 Yeah , I went to school today . Were you there ? 
 That sucks . Did you want the assignments from English class ? 
 No problem , you're welcome . 
 Well , thank you . I hope to see you at school tomorrow . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes , and I hope that it does . 
 I really love how rain clears the air . 
 Yes , but I love the night air after it rains . 
 Because you can see the stars perfectly . 
 Yeah , me too . 
 Yes , I think so too . 
 I hope that it does rain . 
 The sky looks so clean after it rains . I love it . 
 I love most how it is at night after it rains . 
 You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains . 
 I would too . 
 It really is . 
 Hopefully it will . 
 I like how clear the sky gets after it rains . 
 I especially love the night air when it rains . 
 The stars look so much closer after it rains . 
 Yeah , so do I . 
 Hello Mike . How are things going for you ? 
 Fine . Everything is just fine . 
 Mike , I enjoyed your company , but I am getting ready to graduate soon . I really need to focus on my studies . 
 It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done , but thank you for a lovely dinner . 
 Not much . 
 Oh really ? I didn't know that . 
 I haven't heard anything about it . 
 What time does it start ? 
 Yeah , I think I'll go . 
 You will . 
 Nothing really . 
 I didn't realize that . 
 Nobody has told me anything about your party . 
 When does it start ? 
 I'll be there . 
 Of course . 
 I think I am who you are looking for . You have got to be Rubin . 
 Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . 
 They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . 
 Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! 
 Lunch sounds great ! Let's head on out ! 
 What's your last name ? 
 Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ? 
 Fine . Here is your room key , here is also a map of our hotel . The swimming pool , gym and sauna are all located on first floor . 
 Yes . If you want to order room service , just press 0 on your phone , and that will connect you with the front desk . 
 I'm going to the movies with a friend . How about you ? 
 Well , did you want to go see a movie with me ? 
 I'm not sure yet . Is there something you want to see ? 
 So , did you want to go ? 
 Okay , sounds good . 
 For what days , madam ? 
 Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat ? 
 How would like to pay ? 
 I have booked you for one window seat on American airline flight No . 409 . Have a good trip ! 
 Have you traveled by air before ? 
 Let me tell you . First you must buy a ticket . 
 Then you must go to the airport . 
 Not Yet . Listen to me . Don't forget to take your ID card with you . 
 Something like a passport . 
 No , you also need a boarding pass . 

It's very kind of you to show me around . 
 I really don't know . 
 Yes , that would be lovely . 
 No , it's the first time I've been here . 
 That's wonderful ! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful ! 

Do you have a room available for this weekend ? 
 I'd like two twin beds , please . 
 That's fine . Do you have any specials for your guests ? 
 Good . Let me give you my credit card number to reserve a room . 

Do you have any cars available ? 
 Great , what's the rate per day ? 
 I'm going to need it for three days . 
 Sure , here is my driver's license . 

I still have a question to ask you . 
 How much luggage can I take for my flight ? 
 But if I have more than 55 pounds , what can I do ? 
 How about my hand carry luggage ? 

May I see your passport please ? 
 Are you travelling for business or pleasure ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ? 
 Did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ? 

Could you give some information on your European tours ? 
 I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time . 
 What is the cost ? 
 That sounds reasonable . Let me think it over . And I'll call your back to make reservation . 

Hotel front desk . 
 For what time ? 

Hi , are you Catherine ? 
 Thanks , good to meet you , too . 
 Yes , and the food was horrible ! 
 Great ! How will we be getting there ? 

What time's your flight ? 

I'd like to order room service to room 927 , please . 
 I'd like to two roast beef sandwiches and one fruit salad , please . 
 No , could I also get some extra towels and soap too ? We went to the pool today and used up our two clean towels . 
 Just put it on with the rest of my hotel bill . 

Front Desk . 
 Yes , what time would you like a wake-up call ? 

Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . 
 No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? 
 All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . 
 No , before the In dynasty . 
 Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . 
 Do you like the Chinese traditional silk ? 
 Go and pick some stuff up . The price can always surprise foreign friends . 

Where are we going now ? 
 Where is it ? 
 What can we see in it ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Tragedy . 

Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park . 
 The stone is a prehistoric log . It was turned to stone millions of years ago . 
 But it's the truth . 
 We don't have them here , I'm afraid . Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather . 
 They are poplar trees . They are widely used in our lives . 

Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . 
 Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . 
 The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” 
 That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools . 

Excuse me . What time does the next train to London leave ? 
 Is it a direct train to London ? 
 OK . Two tickets to London , please . 
 Single , please . How much in total ? 
 Here you are . Which platform should I go to wait for the train ? 
 OK . Thank you . 

Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ?

 Single or return ? 
 Economy fare for single ticket from New York to Beijing is 400 dollars . 
 Yes . Please arrive at the airport one hour before departure . 

Excuse me , sir . What would you like to eat , Chinese food or western food ? 
 Are you going to have this set course or have dinner in the dining room ? 
 Please put down the table in front of you . It's more comfortable that way . 
 It's my pleasure . What would you like to drink , milk , tea , coffee , orange juice or iced water ? 
 Yes , here you are . Enjoy your meal . 
 OK , enjoy yourself , sir . 
 It is beef . Do you like it ? 
 You are welcome . Please press that button if you need any help . 

Elegance Hotel , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 All right , single or double room ? 
 All right . We have a single room available right now . 
 578 yuan a night , plus VAT , including air-conditioner and TV . 
 Yes , it includes English breakfast . For the phone , I am afraid you can not . 
 Would you like to confirm the reservation ? 
 Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? 
 Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . 
 Like what ? 
 I'm not . I just want to know . 
 That's harsh . 
 Fine . 
 I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th . 
 What's the departure time ? 
 Well , the afternoon will be fine . 
 First class will be preferred . 
 My name is Janice . Well , I book this ticket for Nova , the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company . Where can I get the flight ticket ? 

Turn on the TV , please . 
 What's wrong with the TV ? It isn't clear and the color's not right . 
 Can you do something about it ? 
 That's better , but it's still not quite right . 
 Good idea . 
 I'm going to the movie theater with my friend . What are you going to do ? 
 How about you see a movie with me and my friend ? 
 Not sure . Is there a movie out that catches your eye ? 
 Have you decided whether or not you would like to go ? 
 For sure another day . 
 Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? 
 I wasn't done talking to you . 
 I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking . 
 That's not nice . 
 Okay . 
 I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine . What about you ? 
 Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend ? 
 I don't know , but was there a certain movie you wanted to see ? 
 Well , would you like to go ? 
 All right . Another time then . 
 Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice ! 
 I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd . 
 Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ? 
 I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ? 
 Nine is good . See you on Saturday ! 
 Todd , I am so happy you called ! 
 Boy , Todd , that was one great movie you picked out ! Thanks for asking me to go with you ! 
 A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ? 
 I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ? 
 Nine is a great time to get started . I'll see you on Saturday ! 
 It was nice talking to you too . 
 That would be fun . 
 I think we should go out to eat . 
 All right , so I'll see you then . 
 Okay , I'll talk to you later then . 
 Bye . 
 What's the rush ? 
 I'm not ready to get off the phone with you . 
 What is it that you need to do ? 
 I'm not being nosey , it's just a question . 
 That was mean to say . 
 I guess . 
 I enjoyed talking to you too . 
 I think that would be nice . 
 Do you want to go out to eat ? 
 So I'll see you next time . 
 I'll talk to you later . 
 Goodbye . 
 Todd , good to hear from you ! 
 Me too , Todd ! Thanks for suggesting that great movie . 
 I would love to join you on a hike . Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ? 
 Fine then , what time are we going to leave ? 
 Nine would be perfect . I'll see you then ! 
 I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend , Mark . 
 What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? 
 Really ? Who made that rule up ? 
 That works for me ! 
 I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ? 
 I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ? 
 OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ? 
 I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . 
 That's a chick flick ! 
 I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska . 
 You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? 
 I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? 
 I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! 
 Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun . 
 They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . 
 Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . 
 My date may not be my type . 
 I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type . 
 Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes . 
 I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . 
 Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . 
 Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . 
 Whatever you say ! 
 Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? 
 Want to go see a movie tonight ? 
 Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? 
 There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . 
 Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! 
 Hi Mike , how are you doing ? 
 Everything is going great . 
 Mike , I had a good time too , but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now . 
 Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening . 
 Mike ! Good to hear from you . How are you ? 
 Things are going well with me . 
 Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home . 
 I can't really deal with any distractions right now , but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together . 
 I am doing well . How about you , Mary ? 
 There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ? 
 I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ? 
 I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . 
 Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! 
 Nothing much , what's going on ? 
 Oh , really ? That's nice . 
 This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans . 
 I'm going to dinner with my family . 
 Yeah , maybe next time . 
 Sounds like a plan . 
 Nothing really , you ? 
 Is that right ? 
 I'm sorry , I can't . 
 I don't really want to . 
 I hate going to parties . 
 Yeah , sorry . 
 Nothing really . How about you ? 
 Well , that's cool . 
 I'm busy this Friday . I'm sorry . 
 I'm having dinner with my family 
 I'll make sure and come to your next party . 
 I'll be there . 
 Not a lot . What about you ? 
 That sounds like fun . 
 I'm sorry . I'm already doing something this Friday . 
 My family and I are going to dinner . 
 I'll definitely try to make it the next time . 
 All right . I'll see you next time . 
 It was really nice talking to you also . 
 That should be loads of fun . 
 Would you like to go to dinner or something ? 
 Okay , until next time then . 
 Talk to you then . 
 See you . 
 Nothing . What's going on with you ? 
 I had no idea . 
 I didn't hear anything about it . 
 What time ? 
 I'll go . 
 No doubt . 
 Nothing , how about you ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 Probably not . 
 I don't feel like going . 
 I really can't stand going to parties . 
 Sorry about that . 
 I enjoy listening to all kinds of music . 
 I like to listen to Rock and R & B . 
 I like the kinds of instruments that they use . 
 Thanks , I feel the same way . 
 I like listening to different kinds of music . 
 I enjoy Rock and R & B . 
 I like the different instruments that they use . 
 Yeah , I think so too . 
 I listen to various types of music . 
 I enjoy listening to both Rock and R & B . 
 I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use . 
 That's exactly what I think too . 
 My favorite movie is Superbad . 
 It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen . 
 You've seen it before ? 
 Didn't you laugh through the whole movie ? I did . 
 Mine too . 
 Sure , let's go . 
 I have to say , my favorite movie is Superbad . 
 Honestly , it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time . 
 I didn't think you saw that movie . 
 I was laughing through the whole movie . 
 Same here . 
 Of course . 
 I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever . 
 Well , Superbad is super funny . 
 I didn't know that you saw Superbad before . 
 I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie . 
 That's exactly how I felt . 
 I would love to . 
 I've always liked to draw and paint . 
 I do it every once in a while . 
 I first learned how to do it in high school . 
 That was my favorite class . 
 Thanks . 
 You have a talent . You just don't know what it is yet . 
 When I have time , I sometimes draw and paint . 
 Every so often , I do . 
 I was taught in high school how to draw and paint . 
 Exactly , it was my favorite class . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Everyone has a talent . They just need to find it . 
 I enjoy drawing and painting . 
 Yes , I do . 
 I learned back in high school . 
 Yeah , I loved that art class . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm sure you have a talent . It's just hidden . 
 That sounds like fun . What's the weather going to be like ? 
 Is it going to be perfect beach weather ? 
 Good . I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend . 
 But you know that California weather is really unpredictable . 
 I really wish the weather would just stay the same . 
 Yeah , that would make things a lot easier . 
 A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? 
 So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? 
 I really hope it doesn't get cold . 
 The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . 
 It would be nice if the weather would never change . 
 True . Predictable weather would make life easier . 
 I'm doing well . How about you ? 
 So how have you been lately ? 
 I'm actually in school right now . 
 I'm attending PCC right now . 
 It's not bad . There are a lot of people there . 
 Thanks . 
 I wasn't feeling really well . 
 My stomach was upset . 
 I don't really feel too well yet . 
 No , thanks . I already took some medicine . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm fine . How about yourself ? 
 No problem . So how have you been ? 
 I've been good . I'm in school right now . 
 I go to PCC . 
 It's okay . It's a really big campus . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Go to Gate 56 , the plane is now boarding , you must hurry . 
 Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . 
 No , I will call the attendants at the gate . I'll tell them you are on your way . 
 You're welcome , have a safe trip . 
 I'm doing great . What about you ? 
 Everything's been good with you ? 
 I started school recently . 
 I'm going to PCC . 
 I like it so far . My classes are pretty good right now . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I was sick . 
 I had a stomachache . 
 I'm still feeling under the weather . 
 I took something earlier . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Well , it depends on what you have . 
 It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city , I don't think you would like to miss it . 
 50 dollars per person . 
 Of course . Please take it easy . 
 Why not ? 
 I'm going to Disneyland . 

Hello , it's my first time in Egypt . What would you advise me to see here ? 
 But I'm going to stay here only for two days . 
 What shall I do then ? 
 It's really worth seeing . By the way , I'd like to buy some souvenirs . 
 OK . I know what to do now . Thank you . 
 Good morning . I would like to make a reservation to Hong Kong for August 2 . 
 May I inquire about the departure time ? 
 When will the plane reach Hong Kong for the morning flight ? 
 OK . I would like to book a ticket for that one . 
 Yes , I know . What's the fare ? 
 I see . Will it be doubled for the round trip ? 
 I won't . 
 I have a reservation . My name is Rodgers . 
 Yes . 
 0h , good . I have a long day and it's good to get here . 
 My credit card , please . 
 Thank you . I have an 8 o ' clock appointment tomorrow morning , I would like a wake-up call . 
 7 a . m . 
 OK , I'll do that . 

I'm calling to confirm your booking . 
 You are booked on the A943 on 16/11 at 17:30 pm to Hong Kong with Cathy Pacific . 

How much does it cost to hire a motorbike ? 
 Good . I think I'll hire one for 7 days . 

Did you go to the basketball game on Friday ? 
 You missed a really good game . 
 Our school did . They played really well . 
 Yeah , you should have . It was really exciting . 
 The score was 101-98 . 
 That's what made it so great . 

Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ? 
 You should have been there . It was intense . 
 Our team was victorious . 
 It was a great game . 
 Our team won 101-98 . 
 That's the reason it was such a great game . 

I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday . 
 It was a great game . 
 Our team played hard and won . 
 It was the best game ever . 
 The other team lost by three points , 101-98 . 
 It really was . You should've gone . 

It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend . 
 The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm . 
 I think it will be . 
 I want this trip to be perfect , I hope it stays warm . 
 I know . Every day the weather seems different . 
 That would make it easier for us to make plans . 

It's an ugly day today . 
 It's the middle of summer , it shouldn't rain today . 
 Yeah , especially since it's ninety degrees outside . 
 Yes , it would be . 
 Me too . I can't wait until winter . 
 I'd rather be cold than hot . 

Hello , may I speak to Alice please ? 
 I've been trying to call you all day . 
 It's okay . 
 Oh , I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow . 
 Maybe we can go see a movie or something . 
 I'll see you tomorrow then . 

Hi , how are you . Is Alice there ? 
 Why haven't you answered the phone ? 
 That's all right . 
 I want to do something tomorrow with you . 
 I was thinking about seeing a movie . 
 Until then . 

Is Alice available ? 
 I've called you a hundred times today . 
 No problem . 
 Did you want to do something tomorrow ? 
 How about a movie ? 
 Call me tomorrow then . 

It doesn't look very nice outside today . 
 In the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining . 
 Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird . 
 I know , you're absolutely right . 
 That's how I feel , I want winter to come soon . 
 I know what you mean , but I'd rather be cold than hot . 

Have you attended school today ? 
 I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill . 
 I would really appreciate that , thanks . 
 If you get sick , I'll return the favor . 

I wish it was a nicer day today . 
 It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . 
 It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . 
 That's right , it really would be . 
 I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . 
 I would rather deal with the winter than the summer . 
 I wish it was a nicer day today . 
 It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . 
 It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . 
 That's right , it really would be . 
 I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . 
 I would rather deal with the winter than the summer . 

Did you hear the good news ? 
 I got a promotion at my job . 
 Seriously , I am so excited . 
 Thank you . 
 Really ? 
 You think so ? 

I haven't told you what happened yet , have I ? 
 My boss offered me a promotion , and I took it . 
 Yes , I am really excited . 
 I appreciate that . 
 For real ? 

Have you gone to school today ? 
 I couldn't go to school today , I was sick . 
 Thank you very much , that's kind of you . 
 When you miss a day of school , I'll be happy to give you the English assignments . 

Have you heard my good news ? 
 I got a promotion at work earlier this week . 
 It's the truth . I am really happy . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Are you really ? 
 Is that what you really think ? 

Did you hear the news ? 
 Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week . 
 I would've thought that somebody would have told you . 
 Well , she did , her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 Are you going to go and visit her and the baby ? 
 Good ! I just thought I'd let you know . 

Have you heard the news ? 
 Deborah had her baby last week . 
 I thought you heard . 
 She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . 
 I just wanted to let you know what happened . 

Have you heard what happened ? 
 Deborah already had her baby . 
 I thought you knew . 
 The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 Will you go and visit them ? 
 I just wanted to give you the good news . 

What a wonderful dinner ! 
 Where did you get your fantastic recipes ? 
 I especially like the wonderful chicken dish . 
 Is that shrimp in the soup ? 
 I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal . 

Hey George , how is your chicken ? 
 My fish is pretty dry too . 
 Yes , it seems that way to me also . 
 My vegetables are very soggy . 
 I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter . 

George , is your chicken OK ? 
 My fish is very dry . 
 That's exactly what I was thinking had happened . 
 The vegetables are kind of mushy . 
 The food here is usually good , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem . 

This is a great meal ! 
 Who taught you how to cook this well ? 
 Wow , what is in this chicken dish ? 
 Is the soup a shrimp soup ? 
 I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal . 

I really love this meal . 
 Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? 
 The chicken is out of this world ! 
 I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . 
 It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . 

Would you like some more coffee ? 
 Good luck finding the waitress ! 
 I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . 
 So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . 
 I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . 
 I think that we should leave 10 % . 

Do you want some dessert ? 
 Where is our waitress anyway ? 
 I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . 
 So the bill is $ 36.00 . 
 My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . 
 Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . 

Does your chicken taste all right ? 
 My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . 
 Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . 
 The vegetables seem to not be very fresh . 
 I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . 

You look really nice today . 
 Really , where did you get it ? 
 It's really nice . 
 Thank you . I just got these shoes today . 
 These are called All Star Chuck Taylors . 
 They were about forty dollars . 

Have you met the new girl ? 
 She's one of the prettiest girls at the school . 
 Well , she's quite short . 
 I would say she's only 5 feet . 
 She has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful . 
 Have you seen her ? 

Would you like to order anything else ? 
 Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ? 
 She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check . 
 Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . 
 I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . 
 I believe that 10 % is just about right amount . 

Have you seen the new girl in school ? 
 She's really pretty . 
 She's not too tall . 
 She's about 5 feet even . 
 She has pretty light brown eyes . 
 So you have seen her around ? 

I absolutely love what you're wearing today . 
 Seriously , it looks really nice on you . Where did you buy it from ? 
 I really like that outfit . 
 Thank you . I just bought these new shoes earlier today . 
 These are some Chucks . 
 I got them for forty . 

I think that you look very cute today . 
 What store did you get it from ? 
 I love your outfit right now . 
 Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .

There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? 
 I think that she is very pretty . 
 She's kind of short . 
 She's probably about five feet . 
 The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . 
 Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? 

Did you go to school today ? 
 I didn't want to , so I didn't . 
 That's a switch . 
 No , I haven't . Why ? 
 So go then . 
 Well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ? 

Did you make it to school today ? 
 No , I didn't . 
 That was an odd change of subject . 
 No , not recently . 
 What's stopping you then ? 
 So , will you be at school tomorrow ? 

Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ? 
 Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today . 
 Yeah , so are you planning on going ? 
 It really does , I can't wait . 
 It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many . 

Did you even bother to go to school today ? 
 No , I didn't feel like it . 
 No , but that was a random change of subject . 
 I haven't lately . 
 So then , why don't you just go ? 
 Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ? 

Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! 
 Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . 

My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . 

All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . 
 That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday . 

Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I ’ ll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . 
 Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . 

Have you met the new manager in customer service ? 
 She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy ! 

how are you ? 
 That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ? 

You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking . 
 I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ? 

Would you like some more coffee ? 
 The waitress is bringing the bill right now . 
 Yes , this waitress did a great job . 
 What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?

 The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls . 
 Sure . What's your room number , sir ? 
 A minute , please . It's 6215 yuan all together , tax included . 
 Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? 

Royal Hotel , can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have . What kind of room would you like ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 Not a bad idea ! 
 Well , let me see . I'd like to go to the Great Wall , the Summer Palace , the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven . 

Excuse me . Where can I buy some cigarettes ? 
 Can I also get some souvenirs there ? 
 By the way , where is the men's room ? 
 Thank you . 

Hello , this is Mr . Smith in Room 502 . Please send up a bellboy . I'm checking out . What time is checking out time ? 
 It's nearly 12:00 now . Will I be charged extra ? 
 Thank you very much . May I leave my baggage here until Thursday ? 
 Will there be any extra charge ? 
 I see . Please prepare my bill and I will be right down to pay it . 
 Will you be here long ? 
 There are many tourist attractions in Hong Kong . 
 Let me give you some brochures to look over . 
 Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . 
 Anyhow , I'd like to change my room . 
 All right . I hope I'll be able to enjoy my stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . 
 OK . Thank you . 

We're leaving now . 
 Right . And would you please forward our mail to this address ? 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 

Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 OK . In cash or by credit ? 
 Five hundred and thirty yuan altogether including charges for service . 
 Not at all . Welcome again . 
 I'm Mr . Bob , Room 309 . I'm checking out today . Can I have my bill now ? 
 What's the 30 yuan for ? 
 But I did't take any laundry service during my stay here . I think you have added someone else's . 
 I don't mind waiting as long as we get this straightened out . 
 It doesn't matter . Here is the money . 

Is there anything I can do for you , Mr . King ? 
 Is it all right for you to pay the bill this evening ? 
 At the Cashier's Counter of our hotel , right in the lobby downstairs . 
 All right . Is your companion leaving for Shanghai with you ? 
 Shall I make out a single bill or two separate bills ? 
 OK . I'll surely have the bill ready for this evening . 
 No problem . By the way , do you have any comment to make on our hotel ? 
 Thank you for your compliments . You're welcome to our hotel again . 

I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angels for next Monday . 
 I'll need an economy ticket with an open return . 
 I guess that's OK . What time should I check in ? 

What are my choices for lunch ? 
 Fish with noodles , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 May I have your ticket and passport please ? 
 No problem . Put your baggage on the scale , please . 
 OK . Here's your ticket , boarding pass , passport and baggage claim tag . You'll be boarding at Gate 8 . The boarding time is 9 a . m . 

After you 
 What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here . 
 We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade . 
 About freezing point , I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero . 
 It is considerate of your wife . 
 Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too . 
 Good , you are welcome . 
 I don't feel well . I need an airsickness bag . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , are you Mr James ? 
 That's right . 
 Of course not . My name is Li Ping . Is this all your baggage ? 
 Welcome to Hong Kong . I'll go and get the car . Could you please wait a few minutes ? 

Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour . 
 We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States . 

Good evening , ma'am . May I help you ? 
 Will the object fit into this size of box ? 
 Could you fill out this form , please , ma'am ? 
 Thank you , ma'am . Would you like to use it until May 20th ? 
 This way , please . Your box number is 522 . 
 If you would like to use the contents during the period of use , please come here in person . After confirming your signature , we will open the box . 

Good afternoon , ma'am . May I help you ? 
 Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it . 
 Thank you . Here is your tag . 
 Sure , madam . Only one dollar . 
 This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m . 
 We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , I'd like some information about the trains to Beijing . 
 On July 7 , I have to be there well before twelve o ’ clock . 
 And I have to get up early , too . Are there any non-stop trains to Beijing ? 

The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? 
 Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . 
 Let's put our suitcases on the rack . 
 All right . 
 Go to gate 18 . The plane is now boarding . You must hurry . 
 Instead of walking , you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . 
 No , I ’ ll call the attendants at the gate . I will tell them you ’ re on your way . 
 You are welcome . Have a safe trip . 
 Is it urgent ? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call . 
 All right , we'll come right away . 
 He's there in the room . He's very ill . 
 Carry him into the emergency ward . Here we are . 
 ( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor 
 May I send food for him ? 
 Can I come round to see him tomorrow ? 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 OK . 
 When could I take care of him ? 

I'm so glad we decided to go on a cruise for our vacation . 
 Ah , that's all part of the fun . What do you think of these shorts ? 
 They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too . 
 Wow . You look great . 

There's been a dramatic change in the weather pattern . 
 It has been delayed . 
 No , but probably until there is a break in the storm . 
 I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates . 

We are on our way . I think our first stop is Buckingham Palace . 
 And here is Buckingham Palace ! Look , isn't it beautiful ? It is much bigger than I imagined . 
 Yes we are going towards Westminster Abbey . I can see it now ! Look to your right . 
 This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ? 
 Yes . It is just round the corner . Oh , can you see the London Eye ? Look straight and to your right . 
 This is Lambeth Bridge . We will then loop back and cross the river again on Westminster Bridge . 

Why's the plane shaking ? 
 I'm scared . 

Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Certainly sir . May I have your room key , please ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry . 
 Not at all , sir . Here you are . 
 Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate . 
 How would you like to make the payment ? 
 Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay . 
 Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip . 
 Would you please fill out this registration 1 form ? 
 Did I ? Let me see that ... Oh , sorry ... here you are . 
 We're coming . 
 I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting . 
 The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m . 
 I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full . 
 Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type . 

This is your room . What do you think of it ? 
 We have the room color designed for our guest . 

Advance Reservations . Can I help you ? 
 Could you tell me your name , sir , please ? 

I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins . 
 Ah , where can I find old paper money and coins used before and after 1949 ? 
 Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss . 
 No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside . I think it is time to dinner . 

Would you mind helping us take a picture ? 
 Just focus on us and press the button . 

Welcome . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , here are what we have exclusively for our guests . 
 Sure . Take as much as you want . They are free gifts from this shop . 
 Please try the shop there . They might have them . 
 No , their cards are for sale . 
 Hello , Mr . Stern . This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency . I have made the plane reservations for you . 
 Okay . You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines , flight number 222 . 
 It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10 . 
 You want to fly first class . Is that correct , Mr . Stern ? 
 Well , I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats . Your seat numbers are 8A , 8B and 8C . 
 Yes , they are . I have charged the tickets to your credit card . They are 630 dollars each , so It is 1890 dollars for all three . 
 One more thing . Could you give me the names of the people you'll be travelling with ? 
 All right . You're all set . Have a nice flight . 

I'd like to have the film developed . 
 Yes . When can I get it back ? I can't wait to see the photos . 
 Fine , I'd like two enlargements from this negative . 

Where is Pamela ? 
 She told me she'd be here . 
 Are you rushing me ? 
 I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? 
 Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . 
 Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . 
 Thank you for being a friend of mine . 
 Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . 
 Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th . 
 Well , the express one , with air-conditioning . 
 When do they arrive in Beijing ? 
 In that case I think Train No . 14 will be better . We can do more sightseeing in Beijing . 
 In a cushioned sleeper , please . 
 Have you settled the bill ? 
 OK , 400 Yuan please . 
 Ok . 
 Thanks . 
 From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . 
 Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . 
 That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . 
 Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . 
 I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . 
 Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . 
 Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 . 
 You need to get a car tag first . There's a one hundred Yuan deposit for the car tag . 
 Thank you . We'll bring the receipt up to your room when we get it . 
 Just me . I'm traveling alone . 
 Just one carry-on and one that I want to check . 
 That's right . 
 I will have fun . 
 Really ? I'm glad to hear that . 
 Thank you again for your visit . We are looking forward to your reply . 
 We are happy that we have established business relations . I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other . 
 You are very nice and helpful . Hope to see you again . 
 OK , I think it's time for you to check in . If you run into any difficulty , we'll be here to assist you immediately . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , is there any vacant room for tomorrow ? 
 Well , is there any other hotel nearby ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm sorry but we are fully booked . 
 That's fine , but we have only a single room , is that OK ? 

Lucy , take my picture here , OK ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it broken ? 
 What is it ? 
 Where can we get batteries ? 
 OK . Let's take a walk and look for a shop that does . 
 Certainly . How do you like your room ? 
 $ 40 per night . 
 Let me see . Yes , we still have four left . 
 How long would you stay ? 

Are there any beds vacant ? 
 I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . 
 Well , that's fine . 
 Here you are . 
 Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? 
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . 
 But when does the plane take off ? 
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) . 
 ( The speaker in the airport says , ' Mr . Benjamin , we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ? 
 Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . 
 It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of presents do you want ? 
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 
 Just a hunch , sir . 
 $ 59.95 . 
 Sorry , sir . 
 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . 
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 
 It's $ 60 here . 
 Of course not , sir . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? 
 OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? 
 Mmm ... does it zip closed ? 
 OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? 
 So what's it , sir ? 
 OK , can you name the items in it ? 
 OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? 
 OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? 
 Mmm ... does it zip closed ?

 OK , can you name the items in it ? 
 OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now . 

Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . 
 Not many but these ones . They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls ! 
 Well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections . 
 No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . 
 Okey , Okey . We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House , a multi-folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there . 
 If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . 

Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . 
 what's interesting to see there ? 
 I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! 
 It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! 

What's the matter , sir ? You look pale . 
 Are you often traveling by plane ? 
 That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . 
 Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . 
 You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts . 
 Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? 
 So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well . 
 If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time . 
 You are welcome . Please press the button when you need any help . 
 Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . 
 Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? 
 Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? 
 Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear . 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense . 
 Zhouzhuang . 
 It's about two days . 
 It's about 300 yuan . 
 That's all right . May you have a good trip ! 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax . 
 I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible . 
 I don't think it will spoil our trip . 
 Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads . 

Good morning , sir . Are you checking out now ? 
 Fine . This is your bill , Mr . Smith . Four nights at 100 dollars each , and here are the meals that you had in our hotel . That makes a total of 660 dollars . 
 Certainly . May I have your card , please ? 
 Please sign your name here . 
 Yes , we'll keep it for you . How many pieces of your luggage ? 
 That's fine . Have a nice day ! 

Excuse me , are cameras allowed here ? 
 I see . What a pity . I have to appreciate it carefully . 

Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . Just as the sign says . How many ? 
 How many people are you paying the tax for ? 
 100 yuan each , so you owe me 200 yuan . 
 Here are your two receipts . 
 Just give these receipts to the lady at the door to immigration . Don't worry , she'll ask for them from you . 
 We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip . 

Excuse me , miss . I'm a transit passenger for Flight No . 207 . Can you tell me where to go ? 
 Where's Gate 12 ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 How tall is this building ? 
 I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ? 

I want to rent skis and boots . 
 Thank you . I am a learner so can you tell me where I can find a ski instructor ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Wonderful . That's a place famous for its arts . 
 Surely it will be . By the way , when will we get there ? 

Have you a bus tour round the city ? 
 Day tour . How much does that cost ? 
 Is lunch included ? 

Good morning , sir , where are you going ? 
 When is your flight ? 
 We are checking in . May I have your ticket ? And your health certificate and your luggage , please . 
 Are you keeping this small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ? 
 You must weigh that as well . 
 Your luggage is two pounds over , I am afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir . 
 It's 10 yuan . 
 This is your luggage check , which you must show when you disembark at your destination , and here is your boarding pass and your ticket . 
 Now please wait until your flight is called . There are about twenty-five minutes to go . 
 There is nothing at all to worry about . Once you're in the air , it's just like sitting in your own living room . It's going to be a very pleasant flight . 
 I'm going to check out tomorrow but will be back in a week's time . Can I leave my luggage here ? 
 About nine-thirty in the morning . 
 Sure . 
 1218 . 
 Thank you very much , bye ! 

Where can I enjoy the best local food ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Is it very far from here ? 

Hello . I'd like to change my reservation for March 19 . My name is Mary Chang . 
 Well , I'd like to change the date to March 20 , and make that for two singles , not one . 

Do you have a double room for tonight ? 
 Without is fine . 
 That's right . 
 By the way , what's the rate for a single room ? 
 Yes , you can . Please put your articles in this envelope and seal it . 
 How long would you like us to keep it ? 
 All right , ma'am . 
 Yes , I'd like to check in , please . M y name is Peter Wang . I have a reservation for three nights . 
 Yes , I'm with my wife and child . 

Finally we have a long holiday . 
 Good idea . Where shall we go ? 
 Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ? 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Would you please have a look at the table ? I think this one fits you . 
 We will lodge at the indigenes ' houses . It's interesting . 
 Yes , ma'am ? 
 Certainly . Just a moment . I'll be right back with one . Which do you prefer , one in English or in Chinese ? 
 All right , ma'am . 
 No , thank you . I don't need any . You see , I'm on a diet . 
 Yes , coffee , please . 
 I wanted to check rates and availability for your San Francisco location . 
 The waterfront location . 
 I'd like to check in on October 12th and check out the 15th . 
 One . And , if possible , I'm looking for a non-smoking room . 
 I'd like to book the standard room . 
 Rama . 
 Jeff . 
 A Visa . 
 It's 7388-2424- 3535-1818 and the expiration is 05/08 . 
 No , that's all . Thanks . 

How long are you staying ? 
 May I ask what brought you here ? 
 What line of business are you in ? 

Excuse me . 
 Could I have one more blanket ? 
 OK . I will . 
 Would you , please ? Thank you . 
 Yes . I'm a transit passenger for this flight . Can you tell me where to go ? 
 Really ? I hope it hasn ’ t left without me . 

Excuse me . Are you Mr . Smith ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . 

May I see your ticket , please ? 
 How far are you going ? 
 Where did you begin your journey ? 
 I see . Do you remember how much you paid for your ticket ? 

Excuse me . May I have a bus map , please ? 
 Yes , within New York . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , could you put me in the non-smoking section ? 
 If one's available , please . But not over the wing . 
 Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale . 
 Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ? 

Excuse me . What's the actual flight time from here to San Francisco ? 
 Can you tell me what time we're arriving ? 
 I see . 

Hi , I'm checking in . The last name is Rama . 
 Actually , no . It should be a suite . I had booked a non-smoking king . 
 That's okay . I'm here a little early . Is it possible to check in right now ? 
 Here it is . 
 Oh , just one . 
 No , I'm fine . Thanks . 

Excuse me . What's the time difference between Beijing and San Francisco ? 
 Are we losing or gaining a day on the way to America ? 
 So does it mean we're arriving on the same day ? 

Excuse me . Would you mind trading seats with me ? 
 Oh , thank you . That ’ s very kind of you . 
 Oh , you do ? Good . Looking out of the window sometimes scares me . So I prefer to be the man in the middle . 
 I feel sick . 
 Thank you . 
 No , thank you . I'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence . 
 I'm afraid this seat is taken . 
 You're welcome . If you ask the conductor when he comes by , he should help you find one . 

If you'd like further information on this , there ’ s a guidebook in several languages on sale at the information desk . 
 I'm afraid we don't . Won't an English edition do ? 

Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? 
 What would you like to see in Beijing ? 
 I'll pick you up here tomorrow . 
 Sure . 
 You mean the seventy seventh ? It's not far from here . You can walk there . 
 Bus No . 12 . 

May I help you ? 
 Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ? 
 Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful . 
 What kind of room do you have in mind ? 
 Hold on , please . I'm afraid we're fully booked.The only room available at the moment is a suite . 

May I help you ? 
 Of course . How many people are there in your party ? 
 OK , I will arrange it for you . 

Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 What kind of car do you have in mind ? 
 I see . How long will you need it ? 
 Just a moment , please . 
 I am sorry , sir , there are still 5 minutes remaining ... OK , it's time . We will take a roll call before starting the fantasy sightseeing . 
 For about 3 hours . Enjoy your trip . 
 It's huge . 
 Yes , of course . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 That's a good place to go at this time . How about this route ? 
 No , sir , you have to deal with your own meal since we charge you only $ 80 for the trip . 
 Yes . This is Mr . Wang in Room 1305 . Please send up a boy to help me with my luggage . 
 Well , two big suitcases and two small bags . 

Good evening , sir . 
 Certainly . Oh , you have a message here . 
 No , there isn't at the moment . 
 Can you recommend some popular tour ? 
 Two weeks and I would like to go abroad . 
 Yes , of course . I will book the tour . 
 Yes . I am thinking of a tour to Australia . 
 That's really cheap . What are the fees included ? 
 OK , I will take the tour . 
 Oh , thank you . 
 Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . 

Have you a full-day trip ? 
 Do I have to book the tour right now ? 

I need your help . 
 I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ? 

Reception . May I help you ? 
 Certainly . Where are you now ? 
 OK . Just wait where you are . I'll send someone up to help you . 
 All right . One moment , please ... No , Mr . Smith checked out this morning . 
 I ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one . 
 Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White . 
 Mr . J . Smith . 
 To the front desk . 

Operator . 
 I'll be happy to try . 
 May I have your name and room number , please ? 

May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course . Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy . 
 2 weeks . Is that OK ? 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Have you decided which city you want to go ? 
 That's $ 400 and we will visit 4 cities . 
 I want an American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up . 
 Grapefruit juice and please make my coffee very strong . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 No , that's all . 
 Just put it on the table , please .

 Alright , hanks .

 Yes , there is a 10 percent discount . 

Good morning . May I help you ? 
 One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?

 Right , but the negotiation has been postponed until 5th to 7th of April . Do you think it's possible for us to change the reservation ? 

Hello , I hope to get a room for the night . 
 Sorry , I don't . 
 I only need a single room . 
 Smoking if possible . 
 I am very grateful . How much will it be ? 
 Oh dear . I don't have it with me . Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash ? 

My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers . 
 We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake . 
 It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake . 
 Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake . 
 Wang , what's that building over there ? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion . 

What date would you like to depart , sir ? 
 Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th . 
 And what date will you be returning ? 
 Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6 

The channel boats are quite fast , aren't they ? 
 I hope we shan't have a rough passage . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Yes , unfortunately . I'm very much subject to it . 
 Yes , this little boat gets up a fine speed , and I think we'll soon get to the land . 

Fair-Priced Fares , how may I help you ? 
 When did you plan to go , sir ? 
 The second week of September is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . The high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper . 
 Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines . 

Excuse me , sir .

 Where will we call at ? 
 Dalian is my hometown .

 Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible . 
 I'm sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder . 
 The choice of destination is very important . It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains . But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun . 
 That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves . 
 It's some medicine the doctor recommends . If you leave it at home , you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure . 
 You'd better have all a light schedule . You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired 。 
 Yes , that's right . Having an enjoyable time together is the goal .

 That's ok . I'm expecting a lift from my friend . 
 We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . 
 There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting . 
 Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working . 
 I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! 
 We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . 
 It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! 
 Yes , the lift is just around the corner.You can go up first , and your luggage will be brought up straight away .

 Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . 
 Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . 
 Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? 
 Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . 
 Here you are . 
 Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? 
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . 
 But when does the plane take off ?

 Is that me ? 
 Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . 
 I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . 
 No , this is the second time . 
 Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . 
 What should I do about it ? 
 OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . 
 Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . 
 I am not used to wearing that . Thanks . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Before 12 a . m . 

Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? 
 I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . 
 Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? 

Excuse me ? Do you have anything for a carsickness ? 
 Oh , it's for my brother . The little boy over there . He is getting a carsickness . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Sorry to interrupt , but my brother is still sleeping . 
 Yes . It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills . 
 What ? 
 I see . 
 I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . 
 Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . 
 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? 

Could I make a reservation for Flight 10 to Tokyo ? 
 How about the next flight-tomorrow at two o'clock ? 

So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor . 
 I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ? 

Madison Suites , how may I help you ? 
 OK ma'am , can you tell me the date you expect to check in ? 
 We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates . 
 The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed , while the superior suite has a double bed and mini-bar . 
 Yes , a buffet breakfast is served every morning . I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation . 

I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning . 
 Thank you . 
 I want to book a tour with adventure sports . 
 I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? 
 What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next ! 
 I ’ m thinking something exciting but . safer . 
 That ’ s more like it ! 
 Here you are . 
 China . 
 I just work there . 
 I'm here on vacation . 
 Almost three weeks . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States , so I wasn't sure what to put . 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Yes . I have some travellers cheques and two credit cards . 
 Nope . I only have my clothes and camera !

I have to check out now . My name is Ruth Carson . Can I have my bill , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Which room are you in ? 
 I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . ( After checking ) I ’ ll turn to it right away . I do apologize . We ’ ll change your room to 2002 . 
 It ’ s my pleasure , Madam . 
 I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . 
 No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . 
 It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . 
 There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . 
 Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . 
 No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . 
 I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . 
 How long is it altogether ? 
 That sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . 
 Then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . 
 This path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ? 
 Then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . 
 How long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? 
 That ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? 

Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? 
 Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . 
 What kind of documents did you need to present ? 
 Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? 
 Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? 

Good morning ! The Inland hotel . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . What kind of room would you like ? 
 A single room ? That ’ s fine . In whose name shall I make the booking ? 
 We offer a 20 % discount for guests staying of Friday and Saturday . The total cost will be $ 80 , including breakfast . 
 Could I just take your credit card number please ? I should mention that there is a cancellation charge of $ 20 . 

Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? 
 Will you be checking any bags today . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . 
 I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . 
 Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . 

Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
 We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . 
 That ’ s true , but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
 So , which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 Ok them . We ’ ll go by train . I ’ m sure we ’ ll have a good journey . Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? 
 We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . 
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed , we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . 
 Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ? 
 You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? 
 Well , let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! 
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . 

I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ? 
 Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . 
 And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . 
 But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train . 

May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ? 
 Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? 
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight . You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage .

 Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ? 
 Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ? 
 Ah , a set of keys . 
 That's all right . Enjoy your flight . 

Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
 No , these are all my personal effects . 
 Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
 Thank you . 
 Good morning.Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . 
 It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself . 
 I have a suit that needs cleaning . 

Can I help you ?

 OK.Here is your change.The train leaves on platform 8 . 
 Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation . 
 Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room . 
 How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning . 
 No , it's just the two of us . 
 Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips . 
 Thank you very much . 

Excuse me , when is the next train to Los Angeles ? 
 Can I get the ticket here ? 
 Thank you . 
 One bottle of perfume and a watch . 
 In Boston . 
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . 
 Nearly ten years . 
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere.Would you like to see it ? 
 Yes.Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? 
 Ok.Here you are.Is that all right now ? 
 Yes , I did . I had a fine time . 
 Just a minute , please.It ' s in my bag.Here it is . 
 All right.Shall I enter all my belongings ? 

Good morning , Passport , please . 
 Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . 
 It's just a regular inspection.Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one . 
 Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there . 
 Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America . 

Good afternoon . Welcome to China . May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ? 
 Thank you . What's your occupation , Mr . Smith ? 
 You are here on business , aren't you ? 
 I see . Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in . 

Excuse me.Does this train go to Brooklyn ? 
 Do you know when it leaves ? 

Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? 
 His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? 
 Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . 
 OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . 
 I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? 
 Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? 
 Just like the pattern dragon , right ? 
 Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . 

Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! 
 Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . 
 In the van . 
 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? 
 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! 
 As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . 

Hello miss . Can I see your ticket number ? 
 Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . 
 The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa . Why is that ? 
 I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days . 
 Yes . You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa . 

Put all baggage on the conveyor belt.Walk through the detector gate one at a time , please . 
 What for ? 
 Really ? I'm in a hurry.All right . 
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . 
 Thank you . 
 Here you are . 
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself . 
 Well , then , how much do I owe you ? 

Yes , sir.May I help you ? 
 For today ? 
 We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok ? 
 I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . 
 How about afternoon ? 

Have you bought a lot of new clothes for your vacation ? 
 What does travel light mean ? 

Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 

I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week.Would you like to come ? 
 Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . 
 And I've got to drive.You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . 
 But very much quicker.But I know we'll never agree on this subject.You prefer the car . I prefer the train .

 $ 79 a night . 
 What date would you check in , Ma ’ am ?

 Very good . Your reservation confirmation number is NB13579 . Thank you for booking in our hotel . Can I help you with anything else today ? 

Good afternoon.Welcome to China.May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ?

 You are here on business , aren't you ? 
 I see.Do you have anything to declare ?

Hello , reservation desk . Can I help you ?

 I ’ ll give you their phone number . It ’ s 601 789 5634 . 
 Good morning.Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the seven fifty-nine get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is it ? 
 Return , please . 
 Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 
 Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . 
 Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! 
 Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ? 
 Yeah , I think so . 
 Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . 
 Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . 
 Let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle . 
 That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . 
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . 
 Don't forget to keep the seat belt on . 
 Yes ! 
 Oh , you have too wild of an imagination . 
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . 
 We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air . 
 Tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? 
 No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . 
 Great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . 
 Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to with us . 
 Thanks . Dad , but I can manage it myself . 
 Yes , I know . The problem is that I can't find it . Where did you put it ? 
 Oh , yes , here it is . 
 What's up ? 
 No . Dad . We have a tour guide . 
 No , I won't get sick . I promise . Ok . I've finished . Bye , Dad . See you ! 
 Dad , that's all right . I don't think it will rain . And it doesn't make any sense to take that many things on a trip . Besides I like to travel light . Bye ! 
 Yeah.There ' s an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 

I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card . 
 We only need to verify your information against our records . 
 Please show me your passport and Residence Permit . 
 How long have you been living here ? 
 May I know your occupation ? 
 Is that right ? Which university , if you don't mind my asking ? 
 Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time . 
 Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? 
 Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? 

What's the admission charge ? 
 Two adult passes , please . 

Next , please . 
 Let's see . Yes , here are your passports back . Did you pack your luggage yourselves ? 
 Did anyone approach you to ask you to carry anything for them ? 
 Are these four pieces all your luggage ? 
 You'd better attach these stickers to your carry-ons . 
 Here are your baggage claim stubs , miss . And here are your boarding passes . Your seats are 29K and 29J . Your flight leaves at Gate 7 , and we'll be boarding in about an hour and a half . 
 Have a nice flight . 
 It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper . 
 Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here . 
 Really ? I didn't expect that . 
 I should have booked the tickets in advance . 

Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler's check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That's very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That's very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don't mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 

I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order . 
 World Airlines , Flight 201 . 
 John Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m not sure yet . I may take the train but then again I might take the bus . 
 Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then . 
 Ok . Thanks for that ! 
 Yes . I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday . But I ’ m sorry to say that I have to cancel it . My wife is very sick now . I don ’ t think she ’ ll be able to travel by this Friday . 
 Thank you . Can I cancel my reservation ? 
 My name is Tom Smith . 
 Thank you very much .

 It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ? 
 Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . 
 Good evening . Could you let us have a double room ? 
 A week or ten days . We'd like to have a quiet room , if possible-not too near the street . 
 What's the price per day ' ? And are the meals included or extra ? 
 All right , we'll take it . 
 OK . 

Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up . 
 I must've missed it . 
 Yes . I'm going to San Francisco . 
 Hey , I'm feeling much better already . 
 Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary . 

Good evening .

 I reserved a non-smoking room , but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that I can ’ t endure it . 
 That ’ s ok . Thanks .

 Is it possible to change to another room ? 
 My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Thank you . 
 That ’ s fine . Can I move now ? 
 Oh , thank you kindly .

 Thank you . 
 One bottle of perfume and a watch . 
 In Boston . 
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . 
 Nearly ten years . 
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere . Would you like to see it ? 
 Yes . Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? 
 Ok . Here you are . Is that all right now ? 
 Yes , I did . I had a fine time . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a room reservation . 
 Two weeks from Thursday , for three nights . 
 Right . 
 Robert Hamlin . 
 Double . 

Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
 No , these are all my personal effects . 
 Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , do you need some help ? 
 Yes , sure . You need to put your card in the slot . 
 That ’ s right . Then wait for the green light and turn the handle . 

Hello , Does my room have internet access ? 
 How do I use it ? 
 Ok . 
 Ok , thank you .

 I ’ m actually travelling around Asia . 
 Probably another week . 
 Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind . 
 I want to check in . 
 No , I want a double room . By the way , is there any discount for children ? 
 Ok , please have me arrange one . 
 Can we have two a joining double room , sir ? 
 I ’ m afraid not . 
 We prefer they are on same floor because we have a problem check late that night . 
 what ’ s it like ? 
 That ’ s great . How much is it ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Alright . thanks . 
 Do you take traveller ’ s check ? 

Excuse me , have you got any laundry ? The laundryman is here to collect it . 
 Anything else ? 
 Are they to be dry-cleaned ? 
 Yes , but not too stiff , right ? 
 There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days . 
 In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . 
 By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday . 
 The laundry has sewed on a new button for you . 
 I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . 
 If you have any more laundry , please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door . The laundryman comes to collect it every morning . 
 Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ? 
 I am afraid , Ma'am , you have to pay 100 US dollars since you lost the key . 
 I am afraid no . It is not covered by this insurance . 
 Yes , Madam , may I help you ? 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , yes . Madam , we'll come right away then . Your room number and your name , please ? 
 Thank you , would you hang up and wait ? 
 Sure , here they are . 
 Just this suitcase . 
 No problem . What about this carry-on ? 
 Can I have an aisle seat , PLS . 
 Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ? 
 Thank you very much ! 

Good afternoon , is there a vacant room here ? 
 A single room , preferably with a bath . 
 For a week or so . 
 I hope it's quiet . I hate noise at night . 
 What is the rate , please ? 
 What services come with that ? 
 That sounds good . Well , do you give discount for a week or more ? 
 All right . I will take a room for a week . 
 Can I get dinner here ? 
 I see . 
 I ’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline . 
 I ’ d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return . 
 Economy , please . How much is it ? 
 Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ’ m always afraid of losing my tickets . 
 Bank of American card . The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 . 
 An aisle seat , please . I ’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often . 
 What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ? 
 What happens if I can ’ t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ? 
 That ’ s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ? 
 That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help . 

So , are we all ready to go ? 
 Did you get the camera ? 
 Yup , it ’ s all set . 
 I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . 
 Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ? 
 I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . 
 I feel kind of stupid . 
 We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . 
 No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . 
 I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . 
 Guess where we ended up . 
 When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . 
 I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . 
 I know it is . I don't know how it happened . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Oh , that's what you think , huh ? 
 You know what , Trish ? 
 I hope so . I really hope so . 
 No , I wasn't . It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel . 
 I am Tim Green in Room 1021 and I want a wake-up call at five thirty AM tomorrow . 
 I want to change my wake-up time . 
 Tim , in Room 1021 . 
 At six thirty AM tomorrow . 

Do you think we can get to the airport by 8 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 

You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? 
 Like what ? 
 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 
 I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . 
 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . 
 Tell you what , I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I ’ ll mention it to him then . 

I need to know why I'm being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
 Monday night ? Monday night I was at a great concert . 
 Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly . 
 Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? 
 Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? 

Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to ? 
 My date is quite sophisticated . She would expect nothing less than the best . 
 That's a good idea , except I want to go out , not stay in . Something else , maybe ? 
 That sounds good ! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation ? 

I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan . 
 My date's very sophisticated , so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best . 
 No , thank you , I want to go out on the town . What other ideas do you have ? 
 That sounds like a good place to take a date . Can you make a reservation for me ? 

Could I order dinner ? 
 I want a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay . 
 Not tonight , thank you . 
 Charge it to whatever account you like . 

Hi , I need broadband for my computer . 
 That's a problem . My laptop has no Ethernet port , it's wireless only . 
 Go ahead . I'm all ears . 
 That's great ! How much is it ? 
 Okay . What about the other alternatives ? 
 Yes , that's the ticket ! And if I need to print something there ? 

Could you bring me some food , please ? 
 Can I have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ? 
 Oh , no filet ? Okay , porterhouse will be fine then . 
 Not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion . 
 No problem . 

I'd like you to bring me some food . 
 Please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 Sure , I love porterhouse , too . 
 I'd love to , but I'm allergic to strawberries . 
 Go right ahead . 

Hello ! I'd like to get busy on my computer , but I need some broadband . 
 Uh-oh ! I can't use Ethernet . My computer is wireless only . 
 Any alternative that works will be great . 
 That sounds good . What's the charge ? 
 That sounds good . Now , how about the other alternatives ? 
 Use my laptop in the lobby ? That's great ! Now , if I need to print something there ? 

Hi . I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup . 
 That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only . 
 Anything to get me up and running . 
 Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ? 
 That's fine . Now tell me about the other alternatives . 
 Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? 

I need something to eat , please . 
 I feel like champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too . 
 Just the champagne will be fine , thank you . 
 That's fine . 

Hello ! How do I get online with my laptop ? 
 Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only . 
 Yes , I'd love to hear what the alternatives are . 
 Great ! But is it free ? 
 You said there were other alternatives ? 
 Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ? 

I'd like to order dinner . 
 I'd like to order a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 I'd prefer the filet , but the porterhouse will do . 
 Normally , I would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight . 
 That's fine . 

I need to copy a document immediately . 
 Great ! How much is it for a copy ? 
 That sounds reasonable . I'll be down there immediately . 

Can I order something from the kitchen ? 
 A bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot . 
 Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger ! 
 Thank you , but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries . 
 Not a problem . 

Hi . I need more amenities , please . 
 Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo . 
 Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here . 
 I need souvenirs ! 
 Yes , yes . Souvenirs . 
 That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value . 

Yes , I need more amenities . 
 You know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo . 
 No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . 
 I need to take home some souvenirs ! 
 Yes , souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection . 
 Are you kidding ? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ? 

Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? 
 I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . 
 No , no . I've got plenty left . 
 What am I going to do about souvenirs ? 
 Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . 
 Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . 

Hi , I need to copy something right now . 
 Great ! How much per copy ? 
 Okay , I'll be down there shortly . 

I need some more amenities , please . 
 Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . 
 No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . 
 What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? 
 There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs . 
 I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life , and I don't intend to start now . 

I'd like to request some more amenities . 
 Well , the free stuff ! You know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc . 
 Not at all . I still have enough for the next few days . 
 I need some to keep as souvenirs ! 
 Yes , souvenirs . Trinkets to remember my trip by ! 
 Oh , that's not the same . I never pay for hotel souvenirs ! 

Hello ! I need to make a copy of something at once . 
 Fantastic ! Is there a charge ? 
 Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it . 

Hi , can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now ? 
 That's great . I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests ? 
 In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . I'll be right down . 

Hi , I want to check out . Here is my room key . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course . 

I am checking out . Here is the key to my room . 
 Thanks . 
 This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful . 

Hi , I'm out of here . Here's my key . 
 Thank you . 
 I only had nine little problems here . Other than that , I enjoyed my stay , and I loved the city . 

I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible . 
 Very good . How much does each copy cost ? 
 A dime ? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel . 

This visit is over for me . Here's your room key . 
 And thanks to you . 
 I'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches . 

Hello . I'm leaving . Here is my key . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic . 

My stay is over . Here's the key to my room . 
 Many thanks . 
 This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . 

My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . 
 That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . 
 Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple . 
 Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? 
 This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! 

You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw . 
 Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . 
 I knew you'd see it my way . 
 Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? 
 This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police ! 

I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ? 
 She deserves nothing but the best , of course . 
 I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant . Do you have another one in mind ? 
 Great food and lots of patrons ? What more could I want ? Please reserve a table for me . 

I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
 That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . 
 Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word . 
 You can 
 Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . 

So , now I need your help again , if you don't mind . I'm taking a date to a restaurant . 
 She strikes me as being very sophisticated . Only the best will do for her . 
 I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ? 
 Yes , that sounds like a winner . Would you please call them to reserve a table ? 

I'm taking my date to a restaurant . Could you tell me about one or two good ones ? 
 She will want an excellent restaurant , of course . 
 I wanted to go out somewhere , not stay here . Do you know of another good restaurant ? 
 I like that ! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ? 

Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? 
 Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . 
 Thank you for taking care of it so quickly . 
 You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! 
 Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! 

Well , I've got a date . Now I need to find a restaurant . Can you help me ? 
 Nothing but the best for a pretty woman ! 
 Well , I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town . Do you have another suggestion ? 
 Gramercy Tavern , eh ? I think I've heard of that before . Call to get us a table , okay ? 

I'm checking out in about half an hour . 
 Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . 
 Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags . 
 My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ? 
 Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment . 

I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes . 
 Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York . 
 I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ? 
 A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ? 
 Okay . Let me think about this . 

Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes ? 
 Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . 
 I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage . 
 Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ? 
 Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second . 

In case you didn't know , I'm checking out in half an hour . 
 That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me . 
 I still have time to explore more of New York , but I need a place to secure my baggage . 
 A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit . 
 That deposit bothers me . Give me a minute . 

I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes . 
 Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . 
 What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ? 
 Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? 
 It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . 

I need to get a taxi . 
 No , that won't be necessary . I just need a taxi . 
 Just a taxi , please . 
 I'm going to Rockefeller Center . 
 I want to leave as soon as possible . 
 Thank you , I'm coming down now . 

I need a taxi , please . 
 No , thanks . A taxi is just fine . 
 I don't want anything except a taxi , thank you . 
 Rockefeller Center . 
 The sooner the better . 
 Great ! And remember , a taxi , not a limo . 

I'm going to need a taxi . 
 A private vehicle , huh ? No , a taxi is okay . 
 No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo . 
 I'm headed to Rockefeller Center . 
 Right now . 
 Good , I'm leaving my room in about one minute . 

Can you get me a taxi ? 
 Thanks , but no thanks . A taxi will do just fine . 
 No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers . 
 My destination is Rockefeller Center . 
 As soon as possible . 
 Okay , I'm coming downstairs now . 

Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ?

 Unfortunately not . 
 yes , breakfast is included and parking is available . 
 you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions . 
 Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking ? 
 Even better than a private vehicle is a limo . How does that sound ? 
 A taxi it is . Where will you be headed ? 
 A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir . 
 The taxi will be ready when you are , sir . 
 We could easily provide you with a private vehicle , if you'd prefer . 
 Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine . 
 No private vehicle , no limo . Got it . Where are you going ? 
 What time should the taxi be here to pick you up ? 
 I'll have a taxi for you momentarily , sir . 
 You'll enjoy our new , clean taxis , sir . 
 Alright and what is your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes , here you are Ms . Gleason . You reserved a single , right ? 
 Do you mind being next to the elevator ? 

May I see your passport please ? 
 What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ? 
 This visa is good for two weeks . Do you intend to stay longer than that ? 
 And you will do some traveling while you are here ? 
 What do you have in the bag , Mr . Lee ? 
 You're not carrying any food with you today ? 
 Okay , Mr . Lee . This is just a routine check . Would you mind opening the bag for me ? 

Excuse me . 
 Do you have any information about the city sights ? 
 Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ? 
 You ’ Ve been very helpful . 

Can I help you ? 
 A single ? 
 Please fill out this form , sir . 
 Here are your keys . Check out time is noon . 
 No . 
 Here you are . 
 Just this one . 
 Aisle , please . 
 What ’ s the gate number ? 

Hmm . You have three cameras . Are you a photographer ? 
 I see . And what's in this bag ? 
 I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today . 
 I'm sorry , Mr . Lee . Egg tarts are food too . We will have to confiscate these . 
 Yes , we will have to dispose of them . 
 I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands . 
 No , not today at least . Enjoy your visit to the United States , Mr . Lee . 

Good afternoon ! Trans Pacific Airline . How can I help you ? 
 What ’ s your name , please ? 
 How do you spell your name , please ? 
 Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation . 
 At the airport . OK , Miss . Wang , your Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis is canceled . Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9 thirty a . m . on August 2 . 
 That ’ s correct . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 

Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! 
 Great ! I ’ ll take it . 
 I understand . Thank you very much ! 

this is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . 
 it ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about the kilometers . 
 right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . 
 we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . 
 yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . 
 that ’ s right . 
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . 
 yes , there are . They tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk . 
 Yes , I agree . We can see the scenery better . In a bus , all you see are the roads . 
 I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . 
 Beautiful . 
 I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry . 
 I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . 
 you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas . 
 ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? 
 I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . 
 we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . 
 There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go . 
 No . Do we need tickets ? 
 Outside or inside ? 
 Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait . 
 MYOMA ? What's that ? 
 I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ? 
 How can we get up there ? 
 But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous . 
 there ’ s branch on new street . Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights . Then turn right at the traffic lights . 
 not far . About 150 meters perhaps . 
 then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . 
 you ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . 

Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ? 
 Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you

 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 

Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours . How can I help you ? 
 Very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend . 
 Perfect ! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick - up is included . Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger 
 That is the best part.Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests.You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this 
 Of course ! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . You can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard . 

Some places aren't good to go.But I can show you the right bus to take . It will be no problem . 
 I have never done that myself . But I hear it is very interesting . You two should go . 
 Yes , but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . 

It sure is hot . Why don't we go in the Haunted House ? At least it will be air conditioned . 
 Well . Maybe I'll go alone then . I really don't want to miss it . 
 It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know . 
 Thanks . 
 I'm sorry it took so long . 

Hmm . Let me try something.Wait . I have a reservation for someone named Sang here . But it's spelled J - A - N - G . It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G . It's for a Mr . C Sang . 
 Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience . 
 Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes . 
 Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am . 

I hope the food here is good . 
 But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star . 
 Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ? 
 I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? 

Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in . 
 Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it . 
 But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different . 
 I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ? 
 Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ? 
 I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . 
 Alright , let's go . 
 Yes , I would like to check in . 
 Yes , my name is Carol Tiang . That's spelled J - I - A - N - G . 
 No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month . 
 C - A - R - O - L . Carol . 
 No , that's not me . My name is Tiang , not Larson . My husband reserved for me . 
 His name is Lin , L - I - N . 
 Miss , I know he made this reservation for me . 
 Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . 
 I really think we should take a tour of the White House . 
 Of course . But today I feel like seeing the White House.We should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . 
 Boring ? How can it be boring ? It sounds very interesting to me . 
 The Queen Street , I guess . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction . 
 No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . 
 I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . 
 Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . 
 You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! 
 No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . 
 I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . 
 First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . 
 No , I'm fine . 
 Yes , I need to check-in for the eleven 20 flight to New York , please . 
 Here you are . 
 I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please . 
 No , I just have this one small bag . 
 Thank you .

 Excuse me , Miss.What did the announcement say ? 
 No kidding ! We'll miss the connecting flight .

Good afternoon . Lotus Catering Company . Lilian speaking . May I help you ? 
 I see , Mr . Baker . How many people are you planning to invite and how much would you like to spend per person ? 

pompous . How may I help you ? 
 How large a group are you expecting ? 
 Would you like to reserve a private dining room ? 
 All right . May I have your name , Sir ? 

Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ? 
 I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ? 

I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . 
 My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 . 
 It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . 
 Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ? 
 Yes , madam . May I help you ? 
 Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ? 
 Yes , sir . Did you call the airline ? 
 Certainly , sir . What is the flight number and when are you leaving ? 
 Oh , I see , sir . We have the airline office inside the hotel . They have an English-speaking staff . Just dial 35 , please . 
 Sure . We try our best . 
 Mr.Chen , are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo ? 
 I'm afraid this flight is all booked up . 
 I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers . 
 Is that so ? I didn't know it . can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ? 
 Then we'll return to the hotel and come back , will you change the appointment ? 
 At 7 , please . 
 A party of 13 . 

Can I help you , madam ? 
 Are you all our guests ? 
 Please fill in this form . 
 So you're leaving this evening , we ’ ll keep your bags until 6pm , here is you tag . 

Hello , I set up my laundry yesterday , are they being ready ? 
 Oh , no . I ’ m leaving for Japan at eleven this morning . 
 I thought it the same day service . Anyway , please do a hurry . 
 Well , then . Would you send to Japan , please ? 

Well , we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it , I ’ m sure . 
 Yes , please . 
 We paid for the room service already in our room . 
 No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot ! 
 Oh , is there ? Which room is it ? 
 You mean the room 1818 ? 
 All right madam , I'll check and tell them to be quiet . 

Hello , Is this room service ? 
 This is the room 1425 , we asked for the room service an hour ago . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it really going to take that long , will you rush the order ? 
 ha , well , we have no choice . 
 Hold on a minute , please . 
 I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you . 
 I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment . 
 OK , we wait for you . 
 Would you turn off the tap ? 
 Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door . 
 I will have our housekeeper come right away . 
 When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ? 

Hello ! I ’ m now trying to take a bath , but there are too many buttons , would tell me how to use them ? 
 I read it , but I couldn ’ t understand it . Would you come to my room and tell me how to use them ? 
 And also tell me how to use other switches . 
 I see , sir . Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . 
 I am afraid we have no extra key . So I will send somebody to your room . 
 Please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel . 
 We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied . 
 Then how about this room , with just shower ? 
 No , sir . The tax is included . 
 What kind of bag is it ? 
 What are your room number and your name , please ? 
 Well , let me check . We delivered four bags to room 1106 , you friend's room about an hour ago . 
 You're quite welcome . 
 Yes . Hi , what's up ? 
 I'm afraid not . I'm sick . I have a fever but I'm cold , and I threw up earlier . 
 I would feel better if you came over and took care of me . 
 ( after a while ... ) Walter ! Where are you ? 
 What took you so long ? 
 It's not so bad . 
 It's just that you have to be patient and try to relax . 
 Why not ? Oh well , I'm ready to eat . No need call the doctor . If we run to the restaurant , I can make it to the restroom and you can order . 
 To the restroom ? I have no choice . 
 We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym . 
 It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against . 
 As a guest , sir , you pay nothing . 
 If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . 
 I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations . 
 If you want to live much longer you have to give up smoking . 
 Maybe with the choice of life or death before you , you will find it easier . 
 See all these black areas ? That's tar built up in your Lungs . 
 Look at it this way , when you quit , you will save money , time and your life ! 
 Everything in that minibar has been consumed , sir ? 
 Is there anything special you'd like ? 
 Okay , sir . Three of each . Would you like anything else ? 
 Perrier , Jim Beam , and apples . Is that it for now ? 
 Your order will be brought to you momentarily , sir . 
 Of course . When would you like the call ? 
 No problem . We'll give you both calls . 
 No problem . Anything else , sir ? 
 Let me know if you do need anything . 
 What time do you want the call ? 
 We can certainly do that . Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen . 
 I can certainly do that . Is there anything else ? 
 Okay . Good night , sir . 
 How long have you felt like this ? 
 It sounds as if you have a virus . 
 I'll give you something . I want you to take it easy and come back in a couple of days . 
 Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest . 

Good morning . This is Dr . Mustn ’ s Office . Can I help you ? 
 Is it urgent ( an emergency ) ? 
 How about this afternoon at 2:00 ? 
 Don ’ t forget to bring your health card with you . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It's your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . 
 Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . 
 You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . 
 Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . 
 She had a sudden heart attack . 
 Don ’ t worry . She is much better now . But you are not permitted to disturb her at the moment . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 My pleasure . 
 I'd like to get this prescription filled . 
 Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ? 
 Oh , I see it . Do you have multi-vitamins ? 
 ( The customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . ) That'll be $ 16.00 . 
 Here's your change . Thank you . 
 I've got a headache . 
 No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . 
 I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . 
 I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as I usually do . 
 Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . 
 Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . 
 I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 
 Yes . But I don't know the exact time . 
 Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much . 
 Yes , of course . I am going to have my appendix removed . 
 Yes . Here it is . 
 Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . 
 Then we'll put you in a cast . 
 Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes more intense when I walk too much . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , it does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . 
 Yes , I do . 
 By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? 
 Yes.Let ' s start today . 
 When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
 Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points . 
 Good.Now the other eye . 
 Never mind , just read as far as you can . 

Good Morning.What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have a registration card ? 
 Then you need to register as a new patient.Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . 
 Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? 
 All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please . 
 Please wait till your name is called . 
 Here you are . 
 No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . 
 Thanks a lot . 

How is the result of your lab test ? 
 Then say it . 
 That ’ s just what I want to know . 

Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
 Yes , I need to refill it today . 
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 

What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious . 
 Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two . 
 Of course not . You need a good rest . 

Well , what's the matter with you ? 
 Have you got a headache ? 
 Are you coughing much ? 
 Now , let me listen to your chest . Ah , you have a temperature . Breathe deeply . That's right . Well , don't worry , it's only a throat infection . There's nothing wrong with your lungs . And how is your appetite ? 
 Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . 
 Yes . You'll be better in a few days , I'm sure . 
 Goodbye . 
 Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . 
 Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . 
 You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . 
 Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . 
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
 I think so . I feel very hot . 
 I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How often must I take it ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye . 
 Hello , doctor . 
 I've got a backache . 
 No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before . 
 About four days ago . 
 Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful . 

Excuse me , doc . I am not feeling well . Can you help me ? 
 No , I haven't . Where do I go for that ? 
 Yes . 
 No , I'm here all by myself . 
 But I don't know where the registration office is . 
 Do I have to come back here after getting registered ? 
 Gynecology ? 

Is this the registration office ? 
 I don't know exactly . 
 I've got a sore throat , a runny nose , and a headache . 
 Medical department ? Are you sure ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 

What seems to be the problem , kid ? 
 Ah ... How long have you been like this ? 
 Do you have any stomachache ? 
 Open your mouth and say ah ... God , you are suffering from the swelling of tonsils . 
 Yes , I am sure that you got the flu . You need a shot . 
 Yes , that's for sure . But it is not that bad . It's gonna be all right . 
 Be brave , young man . Only girls cry when given an injection . 

How are you feeling ? 
 You said you never went to hospital . 
 The good thing is you don't need to go to school . 
 And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for . 
 I really envy you , Danny . 
 Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection . 
 No matter what , you are still my hero , Daniel . 
 OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ? 

Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . 
 All right , doctor . But it really hurts . 
 I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . 
 I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do . 
 Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . 
 Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . 
 I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 What did he say ? 
 Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? 
 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? 

Well , what's the matter with you ? 
 Have you got a headache ? 
 Are you coughing much ? 
 Now , let me listen to your chest . Ah , you have a temperature . Breathe deeply . That's right . Well , don't worry , it's only a throat infection . There's nothing wrong with your lungs . And how is your appetite ? 
 Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . 
 Yes . You'll be better in a few days , I'm sure . 
 Goodbye . 
 I need some medicine . 
 My younger brother . He suffers from a bad cold . 
 Fever and a bad cough . 
 What kind of medicine does he need ? 
 How many pills for each time ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Here you are . You left the medicine here . 
 I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . 
 Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . 
 It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . 
 Better now . We are just back from the hospital . We were lucky to meet a well-known doctor . 
 He said that he had a really bad cold . 
 The dispensary closed . Here is the given prescription . 
 Probably not . Some medicine we need is ethical drug which you can't buy without a prescription . 
 I'll go back home with Danny . You go to the pharmacy again . 
 What ? How come ? The third time ? 
 Be careful . 
 Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . 
 I don't know , but I feel terrible . 
 Do you think I should lie in bed ? 
 OK.Do you think I can play football tomorrow ? 
 OK , I'll listen to you . 
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
 I think so . I feel very hot . 
 I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How often must I take it ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . 
 Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . 

Good afternoon , Miss Qi . 
 How are you feeling today ? 
 That's good.Well , these are for you . I hope you will like them . 
 I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital . 
 It's time for me to leave . I hope you will recover soon.See you later . 

Have you got the medicine yet ? 
 Well , these are for internal use.You take a packet each time.Four times a day . 
 They're painkillers.You take one tablet when you feel a pain , but not more than once within four hours . 

Doctor , I feel much better now . Will I be albe to go home some time this week ? 
 Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Should I take some medicine ? 
 It's very kind of you . 

Have you been registered yet , sir ? 
 Are you a medical or surgical case ? 
 Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? 
 Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ? 
 But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then . 
 Certainly . See you in the afternoon . 
 Hello , doctor . 
 I've got a backache . 
 No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before . 
 About four days ago . 
 Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful . 

Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ? 
 I see . When did it start ? 
 Have you got a temperature ? 
 Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature . 
 Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu . 
 No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . 
 Three times a day after meals . 

Hello , what can I do for you today ? 
 I see . Well , with those symptoms maybe you ’ Ve got food poisoning . What have you eaten recently ? 
 Hmm . It may be those then , especially if they were raw . Well , I ’ ll give you these tablets and you should feel fine by tomorrow . 

What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious . 
 Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two . 
 Of course not . You need a good rest . 

My , it looks too queer ! 
 Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? 
 That sounds very interesting ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn . 
 Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow . 
 In the morning , if possible . 
 That would be fine . 

Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat . 
 Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription . 
 Goodbye , Randy . Take care . 
 No problem at all . Could I have your full name , please ? 
 Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ? 
 We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ? 
 It's $ 308 a night . 
 Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ? 
 Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number . 
 Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you ! 
 Not a problem . May I have your name , please ? 
 Hi , sir . My name is Michelle . Could you tell me when you need the room ? 
 Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates . Do you find that acceptable , sir ? 
 The price per night is $ 308 . 
 Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 
 That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , sir . Your reservation is all set except for your phone number . 
 626-555-1739 . Thank you for doing business with us , Mr . Sandals . 
 That won't be a problem . Could you please tell me your name ? 
 Sir , I'm Michelle , and I run the front desk . Please tell me the days you'll be here . 
 We recently changed many things here , sir , including our prices . Do you mind , sir ? 
 The price will be $ 308 a night . 
 Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ? 
 One more second , sir . Your reservation is now verified , so all I need is your phone number . 
 Let me repeat that 626-555-1739 . Okay , sir , we look forward to seeing you in April ! 
 I assure you , that's not a problem . What is your full name , please ? 
 It's a pleasure to assist you . Please tell me when you'll be needing the room , sir . 
 Sir , our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought . Will that be okay ? 
 Only $ 308 per night , before taxes , of course . 
 Now , as for the room , sir , do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Nonsmoking . Now , sir , does a single queen-size bed meet your approval ? 
 Queen , nonsmoking . Okay , sir , your room is reserved . Now if you'll just give me your phone number . 
 Thank you for making a reservation with us . We look forward to seeing you in April ! 
 That's no problem at all . May I have your name , please ? 
 It's a pleasure , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days will you need a room ? 
 One minor problem , sir . Our prices are now slightly higher . Is that acceptable , sir ? 
 It'll be $ 308 nightly . 
 Good ! Now , sir , do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 I hear you , sir . Nonsmoking . Now , about the bed , is a queen-size okay ? 
 Okay , sir , let me reserve those dates , there . Now , if you'll just tell me your phone number . 
 That's 626-555-1739 . Thank you so much for choosing our hotel , sir ! 
 That's not a problem . Just give me your name , phone number , and date of visit . 
 I see your info here on the screen . I'll hit just one button , sir , and you're cancelled . 
 It's a pleasure .

 You're welcome . 
 No problem , sir . Just tell me your name , phone number , and date of reservation . 
 Okay , sir , let me hit the delete button , and your reservation will be cancelled . 
 Not at all . 
 All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date . 
 Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled . 
 It's been my pleasure to help you . 
 Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ? 
 You have to try at least . 
 That's nothing . 
 I'm afraid I've got a terrible cold . What should I do ? 
 Yes , but I'm not feeling very better now . Actually I'm feeling even worse . 

Steven , have you got better now ? 
 I guess you miss your wife and children very much . 
 If necessary , I can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged . 
 You are my best friend . That's what I should do . Please don ’ t be a stranger . 
 If you'll just give me your name , phone , and date of visit , I can cancel your reservation . 
 Mr . Randolph . Okay , one second , sir , and there you go . Your reservation is now cancelled . 
 Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future . 
 Do you have Chinese medicine here ? 
 Can I have this prescription filled here ? 

You're looking rather pale , why ? 
 You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard . 
 You shan't drink more wine in the evening . 
 And you'd take some exercise every day . 

I guess you should know that you need to be hospitalized . 
 Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures . 
 It's hard to say . It depends on your recovery condition . But you need to stay for at least one day for observation . 
 Bye ! 
 The doctor has examined your current situation . Since you are recovering so well , you will be discharged tomorrow . 
 First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered . 

Doctor Ruth's office , may I help you ? 
 Let's see , Mr . Horn ... The doctor's schedule is full today . Would tomorrow be all right ? 
 Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ? 
 The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then . 
 Okay , Mr . Horn , see you tomorrow at 10:30 . 
 I'd like to get this prescription filled . 
 Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ? 
 Oh , I see it . Do you have multi-vitamins ? 
 ( The customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . ) That'll be $ 16.00 . 
 Here's your change . Thank you . 
 Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ? 
 Okay . 

Hello , how are you today . Here for your six month check-up ? 
 Oh , fine . Let's take a look . 
 Okay , I'll do that , but my crown was just put on last year . Will my dental insurance cover the work ? 
 Thanks , doctor . 
 Which tooth is it ? 
 Ah , yes . There's big cavity . 
 I'm afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . It'll have to be taken out . 
 You'd better wait . The gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . 
 I'm in pretty bad shape , Dr . Ford . 
 No appetite , always on edge , and I can't sleep well . 
 Yes , I have lost quite a few pounds since last month . 
 About two month ago . 
 Well , Mr . Brown , I'm happy to say it's nothing serious . 
 What am I supposed to do ? 
 Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest . 

What's wrong with you ? You look pale . 
 When did the trouble start ? 
 It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . 
 Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? 
 Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - ' 
 Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests . 
 The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . 
 I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription . 
 Why do you think so ? 
 How do you sleep ? 
 Are you worried about anything ? 
 Well , there's nothing much wrong with you . You're under too much pressure . 
 Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? 
 Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . 
 Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . 
 How long have you had it ? 
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it about . 
 Take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two . 
 Yes , here you are . These tablets are very effective . 
 Take two tablets every six hours . 
 And take a good rest for a few days . 

What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 I see . You've got a cold . 
 Take this medicine three times a day . 
 Drink a lot of water and have a good rest . You'll be well soon . 

What's wrong with you ? 
 How long has it been like this ? 
 Do you have a sleeping problem ? 
 I think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . It will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well . 
 When the result comes out , I will tell you about it . Remember , never be afraid or be too tired . 

Now tell me , what's your problem ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Certainly not . Take one of these white pills three times a day . 
 After the meals . And do not forget to take two sleeping pills before going to bed . 
 Good morning . 
 I'm running a high fever and feeling terribly bad . 
 Since last night . 
 Fine . But can you tell me how to get to the Medical Department , please ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Have you taken your temperature ? 
 Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . When you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath . 

Doctor , save my baby , please 
 He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . 
 About 3 minutes . 
 Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . 
 It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . 
 Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ? 
 Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? 
 Thank you very much , doctor . 
 I have had a low fever these days . 
 Thank you , doctor . 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it going around . 
 Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed . 
 I need some remedies for an upset stomach . 
 Yes , and I also have the runs 
 When should I take them ? 
 How long should I continue taking them ? 
 Thank you for your advice . 
 I ’ m afraid not . He will be not free until 11:30 . 
 Let me check . 
 It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . 
 Yes , I never seem to have any energy . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . 
 Yeah , I will . 
 I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . 
 I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired . 
 Yes . I can't seem to drink enough . 
 No , just soda . 
 That seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill . 
 No , but my girlfriend has mono . 
 Thanks . 
 Do you have any other symptoms ? 
 Just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
 How about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 
 How did you get that burn again ? 
 You haven't had much luck lately , have you ? 
 When's the last time you took your tablets ? 
 I think it's time you took another dose of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 
 Sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? 
 soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Galas . Could you arrange it for me ? 
 I ’ m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ? 
 That ’ s fine . Thanks . 
 Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 . 
 Thank you very much . 

Would Dr.Black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ? 
 Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ? 

Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
 Nothing works with my toothache now . 
 I hate dentists . 
 It always hurts . I hate going . 
 OK , OK , I ’ ll go . 

I wonder if the dentist could fit me in early tomorrow . 
 How about 12:45 ? 

Doctor , may I ask my mother ’ s condition ? 
 Oh my god . Please save her life . 
 I see , D . But I plead you to help her . 
 How long do you expect her to live ? 

Where shall I register , please ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 OK . How much do I need to pay for the registration ? 
 Here is my money . 
 Yes , I will . But can you tell me how to get to the consulting room ? 

Good morning . What's the matter with you ? 
 All right , young man . Tell me how it got started . 
 Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' . 
 Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza . 
 A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription . 

What can I do for you ? 
 For whom ? 
 What symptoms does she have ? 
 I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . 
 Patulin will be enough . 
 Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Let me have a look . Can you see there's a stone in your kidney ? 
 No , but it's painful . 
 No , it's not necessary since the stone is not big . 
 Yes , you're lucky . But you should go to the Ultrasonic Department to disperse the stone . Meanwhile , I'll give you some herbal medicine . 

Good afternoon , doctor . 
 I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here . 
 Let me have a look . You're very lucky because the cut is not deep . 
 Must I stop all my training ? Will I be able to attend the games ? 
 Don't do strenuous exercises until your wound is healed . 
 Not at all . You'll be OK soon . 
 How long have you been feeling this way ? 
 You seem to have picked up some kind of infection . 
 Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out . 
 How long have you been sick ? 

Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know . 
 Is what you said really true ? 
 Thank you . 
 You should go to the dentist . 
 Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
 Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . 
 Good . You'll feel better after you do . 
 Thank you . I was operated on for gastric ulcer . 
 Yes . I hope so . 
 I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
 I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? 
 O . K . 
 Yes . 
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . 
 O . K . , thanks , doctor . 
 This is a special adhesive for easing the pain . Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days . 
 Apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin . 
 Not at all . 
 Please take 2 tablets each time , 4 times a day . 
 Please put one under your tongue , do not swallow it . 
 Please dissolve one pill in water before taking it . 
 You're welcome . 
 I think I caught a cold . 
 Runny nose and coughing . 
 I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so . 
 Are you sure ? 
 What should I do ? 

There are prescriptions . 
 Thank you ! 

How do I use the powder ? 
 How do I use the eye-drop and ointment ? 
 Well , I see . Thanks . 

Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 . 
 Thank you . 
 Open your mouth , please . Which one ? 
 I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out . 
 I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain . 

Good morning ! What's wrong with you ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me take your temperature first . 
 I want to see a dentist . 
 OK , thank you . 
 Your throat is inflamed . 
 Don't worry , it's not serious . You will get better soon . 
 What time would you like your wake-up call ? 
 That is no problem at all , of course . You'll get a call at 7 o'colock and another at 7 fifteen . 
 So , that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7 thirty.Do you have any other requests ? 
 Okay , sir . Sleep well . 
 Certainly . What time would you like us to call you ? 
 Not a problem . We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7 , and again at 7 fifteen .

 Well , give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with . 
 Not a problem . What time shall we call you ? 
 It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen . 
 No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ? 
 Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening . 
 Of course . We can give you a call anytime you like . 
 Your wish is our command . Expect a call at 7 , and another one at 7 fifteen . 
 The second call is now changed to 7 thirty . Is there anything else we can help you with ? 
 We're here all night long if you need anything . 
 You finished everything in there , sir ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Uh-huh . What else do you want ? 
 No problem . Is there anything else I can get for you ? 
 I'll get all of that for you right away . Someone should be up shortly 
 You already finished off everything , sir ? 
 Would you like anything in particular ? 
 Beam and Perrier . Anything else , sir ? 
 Sure thing . Might there by anything else ? 
 Perrier , Jim Beam , apples , and grape juice . It will all be there shortly , sir . 
 Everything is gone , sir ? 
 Is there anything in particular you want ? 
 Got it . Anything else ? 
 Not a problem . Anything else ? 
 Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir . 
 You've drunk everything , sir ? 
 Do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ? 
 That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers . Anything else , sir ? 
 Okay . Are you sure there isn't anything else ? 
 Be patient for just a few minutes , sir , and someone will be at your door . 
 Would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ? 
 Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir . 
 Sir , you haven't been drinking by any chance , have you ? 
 Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor . 
 What exactly seems to be the problem , Mr . Sandals ? 
 Cockroaches , sir ? That's unbelievable . 
 Sir , are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times ? 
 I apologize . One moment , please , while I transfer you to my supervisor . 
 What is that problem , sir ? 
 Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ? 
 Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor . 
 And the problem is , sir ? 
 My apologies , sir . We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room . 
 We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible . 
 I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir . 
 Perhaps you could look again , sir , to double-check . 
 Mr . Sandals , I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach . 
 You're right , sir . Please let me transfer you to my supervisor 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Please tell me the exact problem . 
 There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir . 
 Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors . 
 I apologize , sir . Just a second , while I transfer you to my supervisor . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Exactly what is the problem ? 
 I'm so sorry , sir . We'll give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also . 
 Sir , we always try to please our guests . 
 Problems are what we're here for , sir . Please tell me your problem . 
 Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ? 
 Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ? 
 Forgive me , sir , I haven't been told what the problem is . 
 My apologies , sir . We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund . 
 Sir , we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy . 
 We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . 
 You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . 
 The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . 
 The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . 
 Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . 
 This hotel has no full-size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym . 
 You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill . 
 The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge . 
 They're available anytime between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . , seven days a week . 
 The swim stations are very popular , sir . I hope you don't find a line down there .

 That's too bad . But there are several alternatives , if you want to hear them . 
 We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor . 
 The service is free to hotel patrons . However , printing costs ten cents per page . 
 Alternatively , we do offer wireless in our lobby . You can bring your laptop down here . 
 You would have to use the computer lab . I'm sorry for the inconvenience . 
 Yes . Come with me to the vitamin section . 
 You're looking for a multi though , right ? 
 Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age . 
 That's my job ! Is there anything else I can assist you with ? 
 That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ? 
 Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ? 
 Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ? 
 Each night will be $ 308 . 
 Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 
 Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ? 
 Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number . 
 Thank you , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you in New York ! 
 You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? 
 I never have seasonal allergies . 
 What are all the symptoms ? 
 That doesn't sound good . 
 Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . 
 I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . 
 But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . 
 I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts . 

Doctor Lin's Office . 
 How about 2 o'clock this afternoon ? 

Being a diabetic , you're not allowed to eat certain foods . 
 I'm afraid not . 

Well , what is your trouble ? 
 Have you any aches and pains ? 
 I'll take your temperature . How long have you been feeling ill ? 
 You have a temperature , but it's nothing serious . It's probably just the flu . I'll give you a prescription . Take this to the chemist's . Take one tablet every four hours . You should stay in bed tomorrow , and drink plenty of lemon juice . 
 It's this cold weather we're having . 
 Would you please tell me the exact problem , sir ? 
 Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . 
 Sir , our guests are our reason for being . 
 I have a sore throat and headache . 
 Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible . 
 Ok , go ahead . 

This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . 
 In a word , cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars . 

I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! 
 Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! 
 Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence . 

Excuse me . Does this hotel have a fitness facility ? 
 Where is your fitness facility located ? 
 Is there an additional surcharge for the gym ? 
 What time is the gym open , and what time does it close ? 
 Do you offer trainer services along with the gym ? 

Pardon me . Does your hotel have a fitness facility ? 
 Great ! Where is it ? 
 Do I have to pay extra ? 
 What are the gym hours ? 
 Great ! Is a trainer available ? 

Hi ! Does this hotel have an exercise facility ? 
 Good . Now exactly where is it ? 
 Is this going to cost me anything ? 
 When does the gym open and close ? 
 Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ? 

Hello ! Do you have a place where I can exercise ? 
 I'm happy to hear that . Now , would you tell me where it is ? 
 Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use ? 
 And the gym hours are ? 
 One more question , Do you have a trainer ? 

Excuse me . Do you happen to have a gym here ? 
 So , where do I go to exercise ? 
 Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym ? 
 Great ! Now tell me , what are the hours of this gym ? 
 Okay . Do you have a trainer to help me work out ? 

Does this hotel have a pool ? 
 I'm not sure I understand . 
 Cool . What will they think of next ? How much are they ? 
 Excellent ! Now what are the hours ? 
 I'm going to change into my trunks right now ! 

Is there a swimming pool in this hotel ? 
 What exactly does that mean ? 
 That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ? 
 Are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ? 
 I'll go down there as soon as I can ! 

Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! 
 Just get over here ! Come in ! Quickly ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . 
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . 
 You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! 
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . 
 Ahhhhhhhh 
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . 
 Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? 
 Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! 
 Thanks doc , bye ! 
 Yes , I need this prescription please . 
 Capsules are fine . 
 Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! 
 Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ? 
 Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . 

Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . 
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 
 Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! 
 Is that why you missed work today ? 
 Www ! 
 Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . 

Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? 
 Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . 
 No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . 
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . 
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . 
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . 
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . 
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
 Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . 
 Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . 
 Having a good diet is probably the most important thing . 
 You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains . 
 You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food . 
 You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day . 
 As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK . 
 Well , first of all , you need to make sure that you eat the right foods . 
 You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables , along with whole grains and protein . 
 You need to avoid highly fatty and greasy foods . You should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine . 
 You need to get plenty of exercise every day . If you smoke , you need to stop . 
 Actually , studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don ’ t drink . 
 You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods . 
 Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains . 
 You don ’ t want to eat food that is high in fat . You need to avoid caffeine and sugar . 
 Getting 30 minutes of exercise a day is important . If you smoke , you need to stop . 
 Less than a serving of alcohol a day can actually be good for you . Do not overdo it ! 
 I know , it's not as I had planned . 
 I'll speak to Bob , he'll be able to help us . 
 I'm happy with that price . 
 Okay , let's shake on it . 
 No . 
 It involves a lot of travel . 
 Yes . Who is speaking ? 
 Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine . 
 Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ? 
 Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you . 
 Goodbye . 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 
 This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor ! 
 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . 
 What ’ s special about a thai massage ? 
 Sounds painful ! 
 I see what you mean . 
 Let me handle it . 
 Your doctor has requested a urine sample . 
 We want what we call a clean sample . Urinate a drop or so into the toilet , and then stop the flow and urinate into the cup . 
 You put the cup in the little cubby in the restroom and close the door to the cubby . 
 He is looking to see if you have a bladder or urinary tract infection . 
 Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results . 
 Why , what's the problem ? 
 Okay . 
 That cup is for a urine sample . 
 This particular test calls for you to urinate into the cup after you have urinated a little into the toilet . 
 You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom , and the lab tech will get it from the other side . 
 If there are bacteria in your urine , it could mean an infection somewhere . 
 Your doctor will be contacting you with the results . 
 Your doctor wants to test your urine and needs a sample . 
 We need you to urinate like you normally would , and then stop and finish into the cup . 
 Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . Just close the cubby door and walk away . 
 He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine , which could signal an infection . 
 We will send your doctor the results , and he will contact you . 
 I didn ’ t see anything out of the ordinary , but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details . 
 If there were any major problems , I would always notify you by phone to come in . 
 A description of each test is given on the site . 
 The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are . 
 Your entire test history is on the site . You can compare your results from other years . 
 There are various choices of blood pressure medication that we can try . 
 We could start with Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . 
 There really are not many side effects . You need to drink a lot of water when you take this pill . 
 It might be , but for a while I also want you to take an ACE inhibitor , Lisinopril . 
 You may have a little bit of a dry cough , but you will feel much better . 
 That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ? 
 The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream . 
 The cream form is very popular . 
 You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker . 
 Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask . 
 Your results are posted on the website . Just put in your password and you can see the exact numbers . 
 We always contact you by phone to come in if there is a need for follow-up . 
 The purpose of each test is given on the site . 
 The website will give you your results and then tell you what the normal range is . 
 Yes , you can see every test for the past five years . You can compare them . 
 If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . 
 I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . 
 Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . 
 You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . 
 We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . 
 For your high blood pressure , we have several choices of medications . 
 Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention . 
 Most people have no side effects . You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication . 
 I am going to add a second drug for now , Lisinopril , which is an ACE inhibitor . 
 You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough . 
 Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . 
 Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count . 
 Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection . 
 It is only a little pin stick . I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up . 
 There we go ! I got the blood that I needed . 
 There are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure . 
 For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . 
 You need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . 
 For now I want you to take a second drug , Lisinopril , an ACE inhibitor . 
 The most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won ’ t experience anything negative . 
 I can help you with that . Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . 
 Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count . 
 If your white blood cell count is off , it could signal an infection somewhere in your body . 
 I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein . It will only feel like a little pin prick . 
 That was it ! Thank you for coming in today . 
 No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked . 
 No , I have never been told that I have high blood pressure . 
 How do you check for high blood pressure ? 
 What do the numbers mean ? 
 Good . That will help me know how I am doing . 
 You are in the right place . Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat . 
 Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is . 
 Usually if your white count is off , the doctor suspects an infection . 
 It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find . 
 That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed . Thanks for coming in ! 
 I ’ Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately . 
 If I have high blood pressure , it is news to me . 
 What do you use to check for high blood pressure ? 
 What does the reading tell you ? 
 I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy . 
 I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out . 
 No , I have been pretty healthy . I just have trouble taking a really deep breath . 
 Peaches make me break out , but I don ’ t have any other allergies . 
 I ’ Ve noticed that it is worse when I am under stress , like during finals week . 
 I appreciate the referral , doctor . 
 I ’ Ve been having trouble breathing lately . 
 No , I haven ’ t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe . 
 No , I don ’ t have any allergies that I know of . 
 It happens a lot when I work out . 
 Thank you for your help , doctor . 
 My coach wants you to check my blood pressure . 
 I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure . 
 What test do you do for high blood pressure ? 
 When you get the reading , what information does it give you ? 
 I am hoping that this test goes well for me . 
 I haven ’ t been able to take a deep breath lately , and I need to know why . 
 No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe . 
 No one has ever checked me for allergies . 
 When the weather gets really cold , it gets worse . 
 Thank you for pursuing this . I appreciate your help . 
 I am very active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the happier I am . 
 Yes , I would call three of my former classmates really close friends . We often get together and talk with each other . Whenever I counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand . 
 People who are honest , dedicated to their work and have integrity . 
 Slacker and those who violate working principles . 
 I'm thinking about that idea we talked about . 
 I'm not sure . 
 How long have you had this pain ? 
 Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ? 
 What kind of toothbrush do you use ? 
 Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? 

Can you work over tonight ? 
 Okay , I'll ask Bob to cover it . 

I thought about what you said . 
 I decided that you're right . 

Hello , Bob . Can you give me an update of the situation ? 
 Is everything under control ? 

Is it okay to have a day off next week ? 
 I need to go to the dentist . 

I'm going to let Bob know about the merger . 
 Why ? 

I'm tired . 

Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner . 
 Maybe I will be around later . 

Bob was late for work this morning . 
 Yes , once last week . 

Maybe you should have told me first ? 
 Because we're partners . 

May I help you ? 
 He's in a meeting with Phil . 

What is this for ? 
 Okay , thanks . 

We're having trouble with Bob . 
 He's been late for work twice . 

John , do you have a minute ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . 
 That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . 
 No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . 
 No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . 
 Oh , that would be too small . 
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . 

Mrs . Phoebe , here are your ordered goods . Please inspect the goods now . 
 Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation . 
 I realize that now . I will do that after a while . 
 Of course , let me help you . 
 You know , we are superior to other clothes companies . 
 OK . We will manage it later . 
 I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today . 
 I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . 
 I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . 
 That will be fine . 
 Not yet , Mr . Wang . But I'm working on it . 
 I just keep getting a busy signal . 
 All right , I'll let you know when I get through . 
 Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . 
 That ’ s great . Thanks for the ride . I really appreciate 1 it . You know my car is still in the shop . 
 It's very nice of you . 
 Please feel free to stay as long as you want . You know you ’ re always welcome here . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave ? 
 Don ’ t mention it . I ’ Ve really enjoyed your company . 
 OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . 
 Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . 
 Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . 
 Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . 
 They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . 
 A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct . 
 That's true . You need to take some time off to relax . 
 When are you going to take your vacation ? 
 I really envy you . You know I'm not taking my vacation until December . 
 Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade . 
 Yes , I often do business through internet now . 
 Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . 
 Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . 
 The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . 
 Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website . 

Mr . Wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? 
 We ’ Ve all enjoyed being with you . When will you come back ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . Take care . 

I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM ’ s China Head quarters . 
 You did a good job for the company . So , this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? 
 I believe you are cut out for this position . 

Hello , Fred . What are you doing ? 
 Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me . 
 What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ? 
 What are the benefits of e-commerce ? 
 How things have changed now ! 
 We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . 
 Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? 
 Well , we'll consider your proposal . 
 Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery . 
 We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ? 
 Do you take special orders ? That is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ? 
 How long does it usually take you to make delivery ? 
 Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis . 

Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . 
 Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . 
 We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . 
 If you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you . 
 How long will it take to make five hundred ? 
 Good . 
 I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . 
 But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? 
 To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . 

I am here to get my prescription filled . 
 Do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail ? 
 How should I take this medication ? 
 Should I avoid alcohol with this medication ?

 If I couldn ’ t wait , could the prescription be mailed to me ? 
 When should I take this medication ? 
 Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ? 
 What are the side effects of this medication ? 

Excuse me , could you help me pick out a lotion ? 
 I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching . 
 Which do you prefer ? 
 Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ? 
 Thank you so much for all of the information . 

I need to get my prescription filled . 
 If I wanted to , could I have it mailed to me ? 
 Are there any special instructions about this medication ? 
 Can I take it with food ? 
 Are there any side effects with this medication ? 

How have you been doing ? 
 How long have you had this toothache ? 
 Is there anything that you ’ Ve done to your tooth that might have caused the pain ? 
 When you brush your teeth , what do you use ? 
 Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot ? 

I need help picking out a lotion . 
 I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching . 
 Do you find that one works better than the other ? 
 Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ? 
 Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak . 

So what brings you to my office today ? 
 How long has your tooth been bothering you ? 
 Have you injured your tooth in any way ? 
 Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use ? 
 Does it bother you when you eat something really sweet ? 

I was told to come to you to get a chest X-ray . 
 Then what should I do ? 
 Should I just stand naturally ? 
 Is this all right ? 
 Where will you be going ? 
 Is that it ? 

I came here to get a chest X-ray . 
 What comes next ? 
 Should I do anything else ? 
 Is this OK ? 
 How come you are walking away ? 
 Will I be finished then ? 

You look kind of green . 
 Have you had anything to eat lately ? 
 Perhaps the food was bad . 
 Has anything been upsetting you lately ? 
 Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ? 

Are you feeling OK ? 
 What have you been eating ? 
 Maybe the food had something wrong with it . 
 Have you been under a lot of pressure lately ? 
 Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around . 

My doctor said that I need a chest X-ray . 
 What should I do after that ? 
 Am I standing the right way ? 
 Am I doing this the right way ? 
 Are you going to leave ? 
 Is that all there is to it ? 

You don ’ t look so good . 
 Did you eat something strange ? 
 Maybe you have food poisoning . 
 Are you under a lot of stress ? 
 Maybe you have a touch of the flu . 

You don ’ t look so good . 
 Do you know who you got it from ? 
 Did you take any cold medication ? 
 I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . 
 A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . 

You look a bit under the weather . 
 I know that it ’ s going around the dorms . 
 I have some cold tablets if you would like one . 
 Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold . 
 You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . 

Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? 
 I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? 
 When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? 
 What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? 
 So I need plenty of space for this exercise . 
 Great . Thanks for you advice ! 
 not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well .. over the last few days . 
 that ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted .

good morning . What seems to be the problem ? 
 I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? 
 good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . 
 have you been working hard recently ? 
 good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other Sy 
 don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use an 

Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . 
 You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
 It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
 Does it hurt ? 
 Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .

 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .

 I want the best one . 
 After this dye job , it feels I look younger .

 The dentist is very busy at the moment . Can you come at 2 PM ? 
 I'm afraid that he can't , Mr Croft . Can't you wait till this afternoon ? 

What's wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel tired ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you . 
 Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . 
 I'm not feeling well , doctor . I have a sore throat . 
 Yes , my back aches . 
 It began the night before last . 
 Lots of people are ill at the moment . 

Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ? 
 what are your symptoms ? 
 it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? 
 have you been drinking plenty of water ? 
 ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . 
 is anyone else sick in your home ? 
 I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The burse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us 

Ow ! 
 I slipped and fell downstairs . 
 Yes , I have . I think that I've hurt my back . 
 I'm sorry , Lucy . I'm afraid that I can't get up . 

Sorry sir . But you can ’ t go into the OR . 
 It was touching girl for a while . 
 She will be OK . She is a tough cookie . 
 In my opinion she will up about soon . 
 I believe it . Well , I ’ Ve got to go back in . 
 All right . Just relax , OK ? Go and got a cup of coffee . 

Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
 Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . 
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
 Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . 

What is the matter with you ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 I think you've got a flu.Take this prescription to the chemist's and then go back and sleep . 
 Don't worry about your flu . You will be OK soon . 

I feel chilly and I've got a pain in my abdomen . 
 Almost a week . 
 What should I do ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I don't feel well today . 
 Since the day before yesterday . 
 It began with a shiver then I perspired a great deal . 
 Thank you . Doctor . 
 Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ? 
 How much longer will Mr . Schmidt be up in the mountains ? 

What is your temperature now ? 
 How high was your temperature yesterday ? 
 Will you open your mouth ? Your throat is swollen . 
 You seem to have a cold . I'll give your an injection and let me write down your prescription . 
 I don't feel so good , Mom . 
 No , Mom . I'm really sick . 

You two are so health-conscious ! 
 Why not ! Before you know it , I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head ! 
 Thanks for the carrot juice , Mrs . Schmidt . I've got to run to class ! 

What seems to be the problem ? 
 Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain . 
 First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . 
 It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! 
 I know , sweetie . Just open wide . Don't talk . 
 Oh , you've got a fever . One-oh-one ... time to break out the children's Tylenol . 
 We're not turning on the heater in May ! You need to take a bath . We'll heat you up and see if you can sweat this thing out . 
 yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . 
 it's important to do proper exercises . 
 the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . 
 we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . 
 surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . 
 yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . 
 you bet it ! 
 well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . 
 one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . 
 the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . 
 and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . 
 nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! 
 yeah , I guess so . 
 hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . 
 well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . 

You hoo , anybody here ? 
 Hi , Rock Sam ! Hey , I am surprised to see you doing so well . 
 No way . Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas . 
 Darling found out he was having a fling , and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too . 
 Ya . And now I can break this to you . Fanny is moving . 
 Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK .

Hi ! Good morning , Sarah ! 
 I have not seen you for a long time . How are you ? 
 What are your symptoms ? 
 Where is the pain ? Could you show me please ? 
 What kind of pain ? Sharp pain , dull pain or severe pain ? 
 Is the pain continuous ? 
 Please lie down over there . 
 Does it hurt when I push here ? 
 What about here ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 How about your appetite ? 
 How about your bowel movements ? 

Hello , so how are we feeling today ? 
 Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical ? 
 Your basic physical exam will include lungs , heart , blood levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . 
 We can do an allergy test , and later I can send you for an asthma test . 
 I am going to check your cholesterol , blood sugar , and white blood cell count . 

Good morning . How are you ? 
 Oh ? What are you worried about ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ? 
 How do you sleep ? 
 Do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? 
 Are you worried about anything ? 
 I see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch . 
 Well , there's nothing very much wrong with you , I'm glad to say.You ' re working too hard and worrying too much.Do you take much exercise ? 
 I can , but I'm not going to . You don't need medicine . You need advice . Don't work so hard . Too much work is bad for you . Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise . 
 Then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . Which would you rather have , health or wealth ? 
 Come and see me again in a month's time . I think you'll be a different man ! 
 I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache . 
 Well , Doctor , I . . . 
 Yes , I ate some cake . 
 Well , yes , I did . I ate some ice cream . 
 Well , yes , I did . I ate some candy . 
 weki , Doctor . I went to a birthday party . 
 Three , Doctor . 
 Gosh , Doctor . I had only three plates of ice cream.John had four . 
 No . 
 Yes . . . a bit . . . ouch ! 
 Yes , that hurts quite a lot . 
 NO , nothing . 

What seems to be the problem ? 
 Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain 
 First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . 
 It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! 
 This is Ryan . How may I help you ? 
 Do you know what the problem is ? 
 Have you had it a long time ? 
 Have you been using anything for it ? 
 That will probably take care of your symptoms . I ’ ll see you tomorrow . 
 This is Professor Clark speaking . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 My goodness ! Are you OK ? 
 How long will you be out of class ? 
 Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon . 
 I have been feeling great , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don ’ t have any problems . 
 I ’ Ve been having trouble with congestion in my chest . Can you give me some tests for that ? 
 That would be great . What is the blood test for ? 
 I have been feeling great . I don ’ t imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly . 
 You are speaking with Ryan . How can I help you ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 When did you get that ? 
 What are you doing for it ? 
 Good . You probably should be much better by tomorrow . 
 This is Ryan you are speaking with . What can I do for you ? 
 What is wrong with you ? 
 How long have you had it ? 
 How have you been treating it ? 
 That should work . I ’ ll see you tomorrow when you return to work . 
 You are speaking with Professor Clark . 
 Yes , how can I help you ? 
 Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right . 
 How much school will you miss ? 
 I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ’ t be in class . See you next week ! 
 Yes , I am Professor Clark . 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 That sounds painful . Are you going to be OK ? 
 How many days will you be out of school ? 
 I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class . Get well ! 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 What is bothering you ? 
 Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center ? 
 Do you need a ride home ? 
 OK , then , hope you feel better soon . Check your e-mail for missed assignments . 
 I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well . 
 I have enough time . I just can ’ t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep . 
 I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . 
 I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . 
 I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea . 
 Is everything OK ? 
 What exactly seems to be the matter ? 
 Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center ? 
 Do you need someone to drive you home ? 
 Well , go home and rest up . Make sure you check the website for your assignments . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t been sleeping well . I am kind of out of it . 
 I go to bed , but I just can ’ t get comfortable enough to stay asleep . 
 I usually try to go to bed around 11 
 My mother is ill with cancer , and I think about her a lot . 
 I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed . Maybe I should try something else to help me quiet down . 
 I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted ! 
 I try to go to sleep , but I just can ’ t stay asleep . 
 I go to bed when I finish my work . 
 I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . 
 Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan . 
 Have you been having these headaches for a long time ? 
 Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? 
 Have you been getting enough sleep lately ? 
 Have you had any head injuries lately ? 
 I am going to send you for a CT scan , and I will see you again when we see the results . 
 Yes , I would like to schedule an appointment for you to come in and talk with me . 
 No , sometimes the test results aren ’ t clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture . 
 I would if I knew anything for sure , but I want to take a second look . 
 You can come in this afternoon . If you would feel better , bring your husband with you . 
 Just relax . We will talk about it this afternoon . 
 I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run . 
 I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run . 
 I don ’ t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question . 
 You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along . 
 Don ’ t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking . 
 Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ? 
 Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ? 
 I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ? 
 Have you bumped your head or fallen lately ? 
 I am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests . 
 I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run . 
 For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned . 
 If there is any question about test results , we always do a recheck . 
 I would be happy to see you this afternoon . If you are feeling upset , please bring a friend or relative along . 
 Come on in this afternoon and we will talk . It will be fine ! 
 How long have your headaches been going on ? 
 Any unusual amounts of stress in your life going on right now ? 
 Have you been able to sleep regular hours ? 
 Has anything hit you in the head lately ? 
 Let ’ s have you come back in a few days and see how you feel . 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 

No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
 Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . 
 349-95- 8821 . 
 Yes , I do . Blue Cross . 
 No , I don't . 
 Can I sit down now ? 

Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
 Yes , I need to refill it today . 
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 

Good morning , how are you doing today ? 
 So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . 
 We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . 
 Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . 
 We will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count . 

I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
 No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . 
 Let me see a doctor . 
 I thought this was the emergency room . 
 No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
 My left arm . 
 No , I can't . I'm left-handed . 
 Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 

Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
 Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . 
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
 Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . 

Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 

My wife is in labor ! 
 Is Doctor Hawkins here ? She ’ s our doctor . We called her from the car . 
 Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks . 
 About fifteen minutes . 
 Yes . 

Well , Mr . Smith . That ’ s a nasty infection you have . 
 I ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning . 
 The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic . 
 The fourth . I ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out . 

Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there . 
 Sir ... sir ? Are you all right ? Sir ? 
 Oh , no . He ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 . 

Can you tell me where it hurts ? 
 Does it hurt when I push here ? 
 Have you been feeling this way for awhile ? 
 Have you eaten anything unusual lately ? 
 We are going to take you to an emergency room right now . 

What seems to be the problem ? 
 Where does it hurt the most ? 
 How long has it felt like this ? 
 Do you have a history of stomach pain ? 
 Well , I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away . 

Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
 I hate dentists . 
 It always hurts . I hate going . 
 O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . 

Where are you feeling the pain ? 
 Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? 
 Did this just come on suddenly ? 
 Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? 
 We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . 

Good morning , I would like to make a doctor ’ s appointment . 
 I have been having skin problems that aren ’ t going away . 
 No . Except for the rash , I feel fine . 
 I would like to come in on Tuesday . 
 I would like to see Dr . Smith . 

Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . 
 I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at . 
 No , it just itches a lot . 
 I need an appointment on Tuesday . 
 I would like to see Dr . Jones . 

Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor . 
 I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at . 
 No , but I have a low fever . 
 I want to come in on Wednesday . 
 I would prefer Dr . Smith . 

I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today . 
 I don ’ t feel so good . 
 I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach . 
 I have some medicine at home that I could take . 
 Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home . 

Hi , I have a doctor ’ s appointment scheduled with Dr . Smith , and I need to change it . 
 My appointment was on Tuesday . 
 It was for two o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 I would like to switch it to next Friday . 
 I would like to come in at 10 

Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? 
 Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” . 
 Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? 
 Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! 
 Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies ! 
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . 

Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it . 
 My appointment was on Wednesday . 
 It was for 4 
 I want to change to next Tuesday . 
 I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon . 

I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
 No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . 
 Let me see a doctor . 
 I thought this was the emergency room . 
 No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
 My left arm . 
 No , I can't . I'm left-handed . 
 Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
 No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
 Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . 
 349-95- 8821 . 
 Yes , I do . Blue Cross . 
 No , I don't . 
 Can I sit down now ? 

What are you doing ? 
 Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! 
 I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are 25 , stop being ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ’ t look natural . 
 I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing . 
 You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! 
 Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 
 What day was your appointment on ? 
 What time had you chosen ? 
 I am looking at your appointment right now . What day would you prefer ? 
 What time would be best for you ? 
 I am writing you down for that time . We look forward to seeing you . 
 Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . 
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . 
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . 
 Thanks doc ! 

Have you been registered yet , sir ? 
 Are you a medical or surgical case ? 
 Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? 
 Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ? 
 But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then . 
 Certainly . See you in the afternoon . 
 Yes , I need this prescription please . 
 Capsules are fine . 
 Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! 
 Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ? 
 Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . 

Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . 
 Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! 
 Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . 
 Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . 
 Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . 
 Is it gonna hurt ? 
 Ok , spit . 
 Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . 
 Yes , I do . 
 By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? 
 Yes . Let's start today . 
 That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . 
 Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks . 
 You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while . 
 Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks , please . 
 You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye . 
 Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . 
 Then we'll put you in a cast . 
 Well , we apply tape and plaster to from a solid enclosure to protect the bones from moving . In this way they will heal properly . Take it easy . It won't hurt you . Let me see . The X-ray picture indicates that your humerus is broken in two places . And you'll have to wear the cast for three weeks . You'll need to come back in two weeks , so I can have another look . 
 When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
 Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can telling me which way the “ E ” points . 
 Good . Now the other eye . 
 Never mind , just read as far as you can . 

Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . 
 I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . 
 Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? 
 Will it take long ? 
 Is it out ? 
 Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . 
 Any other discomfort ? 
 Does it occur seasonally or all year round ? 
 Are you sensitive to other things ? 
 OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis . 
 I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy . 
 My stomach hurts , Doctor . 
 Yes . 
 I have had it on and off for the past three years . It's just gotten much worse these past two weeks . 
 After I've eaten , it goes away for a while . 
 Yes , occasionally . 
 I think so . 
 Is it serious ? 

What's the problem ? 
 Let me have a look . How did this happen ? 
 Was there much bleeding afterward ? 
 Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? 
 Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ? 
 You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long . 

Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ? 
 How long have you been like that ? 
 Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " . 
 And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ? 
 Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ? 
 Do I have a temperature , doctor ? 

Could you make up this prescription for me , please ? 
 What can I do ? 
 Could I ? 
 Great . I'll take this brand . And how do I take these medicines ? 
 Thank you . 

Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . 
 You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
 It ’ s a rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
 Does it hurt ? 
 Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . 
 If you are better , but I doubt you will be . 
 Hello , may I make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ? 
 Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . 
 Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six . 
 No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled . 
 You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine . 
 How kind of you ! Good-bye . 
 Please wait till your name is called . OK . Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . 
 Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? 
 In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . 
 Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . 
 Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . 
 Here you are . 
 I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing . 

I have a terrible toothache . 
 This one here . 
 Can you fill it ? 
 Then I might as well have it done now . 

Dental clinic . This is Mr . Adams . 
 All right , David . Is this for a checkup or a cleaning ? 
 What tooth is giving you pain ? 
 Let me see ... We can see you this afternoon if you can come in at four thirty . 
 Good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve god a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ? 
 Yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . 
 OK . I can afford to take a few days off work . 
 Yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . 
 I have a bad headache , but ... 
 Thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . 
 Here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair . 
 The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . 
 Name , age and date of birth , please . 
 Health insurance company and policy number ? 
 What ? 
 Well , this is going to be a very expensive broken leg , Mr . Taylor . 

What wrong with you ? You look pale ? 
 When did the trouble start ? 
 It sounds like you ’ re coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . 
 Yes . Thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chestache or throat pain ? 
 Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A . 
 Yes , It does look a bit sore.Let ’ s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests . 
 The tests showed nothing wrong . a slight by infection . 
 I ’ m giving you some antibiotic and aspirin . Taking aspirin when you ’ Ve got a fever and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home lie in bed for two days . Take some water then you feel better . 
 I ’ m in pretty bad shape , Doctor Ford . 
 No appetite , always unaged and I can ’ t sleep well . 
 YES . I ’ Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month . 
 About two month ago . 
 What am I suppose to do ? 
 Thank you , doctor . I ’ ll do what you say . 
 Good morning , Miss Mandy . How are you today ? 
 Have you got a sore throat , too ? 
 Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours . 

Well , Mr . Smith . That's a nasty infection you have . 
 I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning . 
 The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic . 
 The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out . 

Oh , I think I broke my leg . 
 Thanks . 
 All right . 
 James Taylor , 23 , March 30,1982 . 
 I don't have it . 
 I don't have health insurance . 
 Oh ! 
 Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? 
 How long has this been going on ? 
 How was your appetite ? 
 You haven't lost any weight , have you ? 
 Unbutton your shirt , please . 
 You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure . 
 A blood test and during test . You can come back next week , say 4 pm to see the results . 
 Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? 
 That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . 

Mr . Chen , I have a Marry from realty world on line one . 
 OK , I'll take a message . 

Mr . Wilson . We very regret the mistakes in goods . I am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake . 
 The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . 
 I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods . 
 Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ’ t think we will work overtime everyday . 
 No , I don ’ t like regular work . I am interested in different projects with new opportunities and new challenges , but I can do regular work if the company needs me to do so . 
 Speaking . 
 May I ask how much I can get every month ? 
 I thought the starting salary is too low . 
 I hope to make 4,000 yuan a month for supporting my family . 
 No problem . Thank you for hiring me , I am very proud to be employed by your company and I will come in at eight o ’ clock sharp Monday . 
 My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? 
 Thank you . Miss Kelly . 
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . 
 Yes , I would . ( After testing ) 
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . 

What's wrong with you ? 
 Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . 
 It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . 
 It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . 
 There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . 
 You can divide it into several documents to mail . Or you can download the mentioned software from the warning . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mr . Richard ? 
 Mr . Richard , this is Henry . I was interviewed by you last Tuesday . 
 I ’ m just calling to follow up on the situation of the salesman position . 
 Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . 

What post have you held before ? 
 How many places have you worked altogether ? 
 I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number . 
 OK . Hold on , please . 
 Mr.Cook is on Line Six . I'll put you through . 
 You are welcome . 
 It's my honor , Mr . Mike . By the way , how can I know whether I am accepted or not ? 
 Yes . Thank you very much . I am looking forward to hearing from you . 
 Good-bye . 
 Yes , of course . What is it ? 
 Leave ? Why ? 
 What do you mean by something different ? 
 I'm really sorry . But I understand . 

I fired Mr . Li today . 

... So what I think we need to do is ( XXXXXXXXXX ) finish on time . 
 Oh , OK , I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time . 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) but I don ’ t think you can hear us . ( XXXXXXXXXX ) Hello ? ( XXXXXXXXXX ) 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) OK ( XXXXXXXXXX ) . 
 It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . 
 Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule . 
 Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me . 
 I will start my work at the beginning of next month . 
 Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . 
 Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . 
 Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? 

Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment . 
 Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you . 
 Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . 
 The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ? 
 Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . 

Our benefits usually include medical insurance , public accumulation fund and allowances . 
 If you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . It is 200 yuan per day . 
 As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave . 
 Of course . In spring and autumn , we will hold some sports actives . And in movie seasons , we bulk purchase film tickets . 
 I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ? 
 It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? 
 I will leave a memo for you , sir . 
 What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints . 
 I see . And the quantities . 
 How many rolls altogether ? 
 Six weeks , did you say ? 
 We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks . 
 That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid . 
 What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . 
 Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? 
 When can we expect your confirmation of the order ? 
 All right . 
 That will be no problem . We never use any kind of inferior packaging . Your goods will be safe . 
 We always do that , but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important . 
 We don't usually do that unless we are asked to . I'lI tell my staff to take care of this for you . 

What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? 
 I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . 
 In that case , I guess I can rest assured . 
 You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? 
 It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . 

Could I have a word with you , Madam ? 
 I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . 
 I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . 
 Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . 
 I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not . 

Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . 
 I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? 
 But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . 

Can you effect shipment during September ? 
 Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? 
 It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season . 
 Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? 
 Oh , that's very considerate of you . I'lI take your word for it . 
 Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? 
 Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? 
 Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents . 
 Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . 
 But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . 
 Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? 

What do you think about the equipment in our company ? 
 I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential . 
 Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management . 
 You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment . 
 I was nervous at that time . What about you ? 
 We can have a rest now after this tough interview . 
 Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? 
 I am getting to know your meaning . 
 Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . 
 After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . 
 And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . 
 The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . 
 Maybe we should call its after-service man . 
 We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . 
 We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . 
 I can agree to that . 
 Right . 
 Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . 
 Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . 
 Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . 
 I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . 
 Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . 
 Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? 
 So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . 

I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . 
 What about a draft at 120 days sight ? 
 A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . 
 I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . 

How many do you intend to order for our shirts ? 
 We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . 
 Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . 
 Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . 

We like your product , and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible . 
 That's all right . We will send you a purchase order in one week . I hope you will be able to take care of it . 
 Thanks . We need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . By the way , will payment against delivery be OK ? 

We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . 
 Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . 
 I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . 
 OK , I agree . But the repeat order can't have the same terms . 
 Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . 
 Great idea . 
 Let it be ! Time will tell . 

To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ? 
 Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . 
 Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . 
 Good . Now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month . 
 OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 When do you want me to come ? 
 That's fine . I can make it . 
 Sure , what's the matter ? 
 What do you think we can do about this ? 
 Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . 
 OK ! I will try this . 
 Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . 
 Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? 
 If you have any further questions , just ask me . 
 You are welcome . Have a nice day . 
 I've worked in the Production Department for two years . 
 Working with my colleagues , we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 % . 
 Yes . I got a bachelor's degree in English from Beijing University . 
 I can get more promotion in your company . 
 Thank you . 
 I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . 
 I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . 
 I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . 
 Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? 
 I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . 
 Thanks for your praise , Madam . 
 What's wrong ? We have been working overtime recently . 
 Must we finish our task before the holiday ? 
 OK . I know . But Bob wanted to change shifts with me tonight . 
 He said he would celebrate his girlfriend's birthday . 
 It is convenient for me to work overtime tonight . 

OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . 
 Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . 
 Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . 
 OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . 
 Go ahead . 
 Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . 
 Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . 
 Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? 
 Really ? When will she come back ? 
 Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back . 
 The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible . 

Madam , what can I do for you ? 
 I get it . And ... ? 
 How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? 
 OK , I will prepare it right now . 
 Please trust me . I will finish it very well . 
 How long would I wait ? 
 Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible . 
 OK , good-bye . 
 Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ? 
 I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . 
 Well , let me check again under a different heading . 
 Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' . 
 This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? 
 We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . 
 Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 Hi , Jimmy , good morning . 
 I see . 
 Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . 
 Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? 
 Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know . 

Ladies and gentlemen , dear Mr . Simpson . Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company , we established steady cooperation . And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr . Simpson with us . Mr . Simpson is well-known for his success and his career . So first of all , let me , on the behalf of all present here , extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest . Now let's invite Mr . Simpson to give us his speech . 
 Well , I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending . Thank you again . 
 Yes . I have given all the designers notice of meeting by telephone . 
 Yes , I have prepared . I have also prepared a meeting memo . 
 I have also got them ready for the lecture . 
 Sure . 
 I have prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for everyone to sit by . What time would you like to provide the refreshment ? 

Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ? 
 Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . 
 My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . 
 It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . 

George , I heard our eighth generation computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contract with our company . You have done a good job . We are so proud of you . 
 Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best . 
 Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 
 But the sales number is close to the predicted amount . 
 Take it easy . Be confident of yourself . I'm sure you can do it . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ? 
 It sucks . But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience . 
 How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . 
 But I lost the chance . 

Bell Computers Limited , can I help you ? 
 Hold on please . 
 Yes , can you please let him know I called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? My name's Mary , and I'm calling from Happy Travel . My number is 123 456 789 . 
 Yes , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . Have you got that ? 
 Great . Thanks . 
 No , that's it . Thanks . Bye . 

So awful ! I never fancy my salary is so little . 
 Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . 
 I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . 

Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down . 
 I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . 
 The first is why you choose our company ? 
 Why do you want to quit your present company ? 
 Well , when do you think you can come over to work ? 
 When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month . 

Why are you leaving your present job ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 Why are you interested in working with this company ? 

Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ? 
 I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 Have you applied for work with any other companies ? 
 If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ? 

Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? 
 Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? 
 Yes , ' One customer--one file ' is essential . And remember to update them timely . 
 Correct . 
 Yes , prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office . 
 Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago . 
 I took Accounting as my major . 
 I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue . 
 There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible . 
 Yes , madam . I know that I'll be expected , first of all , to work hard if I'm hired . 
 Not yet . I seem to move my house to that place . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this trip . 
 Correct ! I have three-day visit to Shanghai on December 10th . 
 I would like a single room with a bath for two nights . Can you help me to reserve a hotel room for me ? 

Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done . 
 You ’ re welcome . I appreciate your coming . 
 We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not . 
 Well , I really appreciate your coming today . 
 Good-bye . 
 Thank you . So pleasant to meet you here ! 
 Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you . 
 That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . 
 Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ? 
 Sounds like we have the same idea . 
 Good morning . Yes , I am . But I ’ m sorry I don ’ t think I know you . 
 Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? 
 Could you tell me about your work experience ? 
 Do you enjoy your work ? 
 Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain . 
 Good . Go on , please . 
 Anything else ? 
 Good . The work includes keeping the files . Have you got any practical experience with that ? 

Is this the first time you've come to our city , Mr . Ross ? 
 I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ? 
 We intend to establish business relationship with your company on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . 
 Thank you very much for offering me this opportunity . 
 I have enjoyed talking with you too . Thank you . 
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 367 - 1314 . You can call me between four and six in the afternoon . 
 Thank you for your interview . 
 Pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . 
 That ’ s what I understand . 
 Exactly my understanding . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Just one . I noticed an item about flextime . Is that a possibility for me ? 
 Good . Now , if you ’ ll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . 
 I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . 
 I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . 
 Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm . 
 Thank you . 

Here I raise a question for you . Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan . Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ? 
 Well , that's right . How about on a formal occasion ? What should I say to show my gratitude ? 
 And then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ? 
 That sounds good , Fred ! 
 I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . 
 Well , I understand . 

Dear fellows . As you know , Mr . Ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company . 
 Just as what I said in my welcome speech , Mr . Ross's visit to our company is meaningful for both our two companies . Thank you very much for your visiting . We will miss you all the time . 
 That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please . 

What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? 
 Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future . 
 Definitely ! Thank you ! 
 Yes , they notify me to work next week . 
 It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop . 
 My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours . 
 But it matches my major . 
 My wage depends on production results . 
 The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy . 
 There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management . 
 I will . 
 How many workers are there on the lines ? 
 Oh , it's highly efficient . 
 How do you control the quality of the products ? 
 Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . 

Hello , the International Hotel . May I help you ? 
 What time would you like your table ? 
 Would you like to sit in the hall or in the private room ? 
 Wait for a moment , please . Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem . 
 OK . A reservation for eight at7 : 30 , Room 208 . Please don't be more than half hour late , or we will have to give it to other guests . 
 Good morning , Mr . Yang . Thank you very much . Can I work now ? 
 I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? 
 Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview . 
 Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? 
 Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? 
 OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? 
 Can we add up this item to the agreement ? 
 No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ? 
 Thank you . I'll work hard . 
 Yes , sir . Shall I explain the details of the plan now ? 
 According to your schedule , you will visit the Times Company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11 

What is your salary now ? 
 What's your expected salary ? 
 I can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . Raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . Is this satisfactory ? 
 Any question about the work ? 
 The general manager of your section . 
 We'll offer that on holidays . 
 Yes , we have inspection abroad . 
 Okay . 
 Is there anything special they would like to do ? 
 That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ? 
 I will set it up . 

Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . 
 First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . 
 The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . 
 As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . 

Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . 
 Do you have some points to bring up ? 
 Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ? 
 It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? 
 As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . 
 Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . 
 If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . 
 Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . 
 That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . 

Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 This is our new brand . I can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards . 
 With pleasure . It's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . Besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on . 
 The hard drive has 260 G and the RAM is 4 G . 
 Yes . The price differs depending on how many you want . 
 Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount . 
 Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company . 
 I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? 
 Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? 
 We're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes . We should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want . 
 How long would it take you to deliver the orders ? 
 Good . I'll send your catalogues to those who are interested . Meanwhile , may I have an indication of price ? Can I have your price-sheet ? 

Hi , Bob , this is John Lin . 
 I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . 

I'm afraid I've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week . 
 I will explain the problem briefly . We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged . 
 Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau . According to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases . 
 Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately . 

Any questions ? 
 Can we get in touch with you by e-mail ? Is this convenient for you ? 
 Thank you for your interest in our company . 

Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ? 
 Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 

What course did you like best ? 
 Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? 

What ’ s your major weak point ? 
 What are you greatest strength ? 
 Does your present employer know you are looking for another job ? 

Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? 
 It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . 
 Definitely ! 

How do you spend your spare time ? Are you interested in sports ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 

Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning . 
 That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . 
 Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . 
 Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years . 
 To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . 
 Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? 
 Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . 

You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? 
 If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? 
 I'm afraid that's too much for us . 
 All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . 
 You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . 
 Oh , that's pitiful . 
 No . I'm still working on it . 
 Give me one more day . 
 Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . 
 All these say a lot for their characters . 

John , you have done a good job . Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contracts with our company . You really did a good job . 
 Hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best . 
 Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 
 But the sale number is close to the predicted amount . 
 Take it easy . Be confident . I'm sure you can do it . 
 Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ? 
 My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? 
 What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . 
 It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . 

Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . 
 It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . 
 Well , can you explain it to me ? 
 Can you reduce more ? 
 In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . 
 If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . 

Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ? 
 Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets . 
 That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets . 
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? 
 What are your terms of payment ? 
 Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ? 
 Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor . 

I've come to hear about your offer . 
 I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . 
 I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . 
 I agree that yours are of the top . 
 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . 
 Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . 
 Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . 
 In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . 
 But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . 

We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ? 
 I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ? 
 What about the cost of delivery ? 

How about the repair fee ? 
 Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ? 
 I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? 
 To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time . 

Mrs . Lin . Please hold all of my calls for the next hour . 
 Yes , I'll talk to her . 

Why are you quitting ? 

Tom . Please do not disturb me for the next hour . 
 Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted . 

Look at this fair . This is my first chance to be involved in the fair . It is so gorgeous and amazing ! 
 Now we should design our booth . Do you know the number for our booth , B ? 
 Lucky number . Find its location now . 
 Here it is . Well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from . 
 Yes , they should be put in the most attractive place , and this can appeal to passers-by's attention . 
 These are your products ? 
 May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer . 
 Thank you . 
 OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? 

Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ? 
 I'll put the call through then . 

Marry Wang's Office , this is Marry . 
 How can I help you ? 

Do you want to talk with John with tongue ? 
 When should I tell him to call back ? 
 All right . 

Marry Lin's Office , this is Linda . 
 Hi , Mr . Wang , what can I help you with ? 
 Certainly , hold on . 

Dodge Automobiles , may I help you ? 
 No , I'm the operator . 
 One moment and I'll check . 
 Is Mr Li in ? 
 Ok . 
 I need to speak with David Lin . 
 Thank you , I'll try again later . 
 Is Dan in ? 
 Yes , this is Tom White . 
 Thank you . 
 Marry Lin please . 
 All right , could I leave a message ? 
 Please ask her to call John . 
 We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior . 
 I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas . 
 Yes , Mary ? 
 Oh . I'm sorry but I just accepted another offer which I feel is better suited to my needs . 
 I really appreciate the offer , but I must decline it . 
 I will , good luck . 
 Well , Let's get down to business ( shall we ? ) Now is probably a good time to start our discussion , the main purpose of this meeting is to talk about the benefits and disadvantages of our new project . 

Hi , is this Sue ? 
 Sue , this is Tom Lin from Allied Trust and I'm calling to offer you a position with our firm . 
 Senior account rep . 
 It starts at $ 30,000 . S 

You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? 
 That's not as complicated as you suppose . 
 It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . 
 Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . 
 Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . 
 I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work 
 Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . 
 I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . 
 The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . 
 Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department . 
 15 years . 
 Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . 
 Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . 
 Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . 
 She's in a meeting until noon . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Say it . 
 That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . 
 Could you put it in detail ? 
 I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . 
 I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . 
 I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . 
 I like it very much . 
 No , I don ’ t mind at all . I receive 3,000 RIB a month , after tax . 
 I ’ m afraid there isn ’ t . My boss only pays lip service . 
 My expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 RIB range . That ’ s the take-home pay . 
 OK . Have you seen the samples ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . We are trying to give you a favourable one . 
 150 yuan for each piece . 
 How about 130 yuan ? 
 That's too little . Well , I'll come down to 120 yuan . 
 If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . 
 Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe . 
 I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . 
 Dishonesty . It ’ s unacceptable . 
 Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job . 
 I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . 
 Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . 
 In a couple of days , I was told . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . What's your date of delivery ? 
 What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? 
 Can you deliver them earlier ? 
 Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . 
 I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . 
 Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . 
 I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . 
 Yes , in most circumstances . 
 Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently . 
 Yes , Marry ? 
 I see . 
 Maybe so . But I'm fast learner and I'm willing to work overtime to learn the business . 
 I must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance . 
 We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off . 
 I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed . 

I'd like to speak to Robert . 
 Hello , Robert . This is Frank . I'm coming to Guangzhou on the the 7th and I'd like to call in to discuss the project plan . 
 Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ? 
 Oh , yes . That's fine with me . Maybe we can have lunch together . 

All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ? 
 I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00 
 Perhaps one year , I'm not sure . 
 I'm afraid not . Why don't you call the Help Desk ? Someone there will be able to help you . 

Good morning , Textile Import & Export Company . 
 That's all right . Maybe we can make another arrangement . 
 I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . In fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . 
 I'm terribly sorry , Mr Miller , but Mr . Zhang is really busy this week . 
 Please let me check . Tomorrow afternoon - Yes , he'll be free from 2:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ? 

Hello . Mr . Zhang . It's Mary . 
 I'm afraid we're really staffed this week , Mr . Li . I'd like to meet you , but I'm sorry I really can't . 
 Not at all , sir . I'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , I'll have time at the beginning of next week . 
 How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ? 

I see there are some workmen on the site . When is the building work due to start ? 
 How long will the sub contractors be on site ? 
 I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers . 
 I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ? 
 Are you sure that's high enough ? 

How's the building work going ? 
 What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget . 
 OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time . 
 We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ? 

I'm phoning about the factory visit next Friday . What should I do when I arrive ? 
 OK , thanks . Look forward to seeing you on Friday , then . 
 That's excellent . How have you managed that ? 
 What does that mean exactly ? 
 What other sources of energy do you use ? 

Have you always been on this site ? 
 Why did you move ? 

Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . 
 Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . 
 We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . 
 No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract . 
 Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . 
 I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer . 
 It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! 
 Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . 
 I'm nervous . I have to make a big presentation in the meeting . 

Rose , is this you ? 
 This is Susan . Would you mind taking charge of decorating the office for our Christmas party ? 
 You can get your supplies upstairs from Mrs . Horn . 
 You can ask Frank and Cathy to help you . 
 You flatter me . 
 Yes . I have a great team working with me . 
 Many thanks . 
 Well , as I know this company is one of the largest and best in this field of business . It mainly produces toys for children . It employs more than 10,000 people throughout the world . The president now is Mr . Jackson . The Shanghai branch was founded five years ago with a staff of more than 2,000 . 
 May I work in sales department ? 
 I ’ m paid 2,000 yuan per month plus some allowances and bonus as that come to about 3,000 yuan a month . How much will you pay me ? 
 Do you have any fringe benefits ? 
 How about insurance and full health insurance ? 
 That sounds good . 
 I told you so . I kept having problems with it yesterday . I don't know what's wrong . 

Hello , this is Lucy . May I speak to Mr . Smith ? 
 I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith . 
 I've got a fever and a very sore throat . 
 Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow . 
 Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye . 

Thank you for seeing me . Did you look over my letter and resume ? 
 Yes , I think it is possible more important than the salary . 
 Good , about the essential living conditions ? 
 I see . I'm a female . Are there any special benefits for me ? 
 I think it is very necessary for us . I wonder whether I am on holiday with payment every year . 
 Right . How about the unemployment compensation and the retirement pension ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ? 

Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? 
 That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? 

Mr . Tang , we have decided to hire you . How much do you expect to get a month ? 
 I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary . 
 Maybe , but there are many fringe benefits here . 
 Additional to medical benefits , we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car . 
 OK , 4000 yuan a month . 
 Not at all , it's reasonable . 
 The reason for my application for this position is simple . My educational background and professional experience make me qualified for the job . 
 Oh , just one thing , could you give me some ideas of the pay ? 
 2,000 RIB per month . 
 3,000 RIB per month . 
 No , that's all . 
 We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ? 
 No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . 
 Really ? Wow , it is great . 
 I suppose so . It's great . 
 Yes , is there a coffee machine around here ? 
 Where is the break room ? 
 Got it . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I got $ 3,000 per month . 
 Yes , I think so . That would be more than I have wished . 
 What about early next week ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you very much . Mr . George . As a newcomer , I understand that you have your consideration and I am satisfied with the raise . 
 Thank you again . I'll keep doing my best . 
 I'm paid on a salary . 
 At present I get 1,800 yuan per month . 
 That's not the problem I care about . You can decide on my capacity and experience . 
 Thank you , Mr . Brown . I really appreciate your assistance . 
 Can I ask what the position pays ? 
 My current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan . 
 Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well . 
 I have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so I'd like to commence at HAD 2,500 a month . 
 I see . 
 I'm glad to meet you , Sue . Please have a seat . 
 We've looked over your letter and resume and I'm very satisfied with them . Today I want to invite you talk about insurance you're interested in . 
 Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek . 
 Yes . All the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy . 

Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration ? 
 All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ? 
 Well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . It's a pleasure to talk to you , Mr . Liu . 

Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our firm to take into consideration ? 
 No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room . 
 You ’ ll get bonuses at the end of each year according to your achievements . Besides , we offer you 1 % commission on all your sales . 
 You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . In addition , you may have a paid month vacation every year . But when it is necessary , we do expect you to work overtime . Does it suit you ? 
 If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me . 

What is my schedule for today , Miss Liu ? 
 Do you have the meeting report ready ? 

Kenvir ? Hi , it's Alice . I'm very sorry that I have a big favor to ask you again . 
 Well , I've got a huge load of typing and Mr . Brown has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon . Could you help me to type half of it ? 
 Thank you , Kenvir . You're so kind . 
 Yes . I once worked in a small company for one year . 
 My reason for leaving is that I wish to get into the advertising business . 
 I've learnt a lot about business knowhow . I got to know what kind of knowledge was needed in my future work . 
 I'm in a bit of a hurry , Miss Liu . Can you wait for a minute ? 
 All right . What's the problem ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Take good care of your husband . I'll find another one to replace you . 
 We work in teams . There are about four to six people in each team . I'm training to be a team leader . Each team member is responsible for the quality of the goods we produce . We are multi-skilled so we can rotate jobs . I like that . It stops the work getting boring . 
 I've noticed you've been working overtime a lot . 

What does your job involve ? 

Could you tell me something about your previous job ? 
 Didn't you like it ? 
 Why do you choose our company ? 
 What do you know about our company ? 

How many hours do you work a week ? 
 And how many weeks holiday do you get a year ? 
 Do you do overtime ? 

What sort of shift-system do you operate ? 
 Do you ever have to do the night shift ? 

Good evening , Mr . Taylor . I'm so glad you were able to come . 
 Now dinner's ready . Let go over to the dinner table . Would you like to use the chopsticks or the fork and knife , Mr . Taylor ? 
 Yes , hope you like it . Do you need beer or wine ? 
 I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . 

So , who do you work for ? 
 And which side of the business do you work in ? 
 Where are DAK headquarters ? 

Would you mind answering a few personal questions ? 
 OK . Does your present employer know that you are going to leave ? 
 Will she let you leave your present job ? 
 Why do you want to leave your present job ? 
 I appreciate you frankness . Do you know anything about our company ? 

How do you get along with your co-workers ? 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 
 I think you ’ re right , but it does seem that there are always a few coworkers that are harder to work with than others . 
 He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . 
 I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . 
 It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy . 
 Yes , I agree with you . 
 We design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals , hotels anc small factories . We specialise in medium-sized generators but we're hoping to diversify into larger models next year . 
 We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . 
 I have been a salesman . 
 I am in charge of the trading department . 
 I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . 
 I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . 
 I'm very much interested in the position . 
 I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours . 
 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00 
 Yes . That ’ s right . 
 Well , I ’ ll wait . 
 Thank you . Coffee , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 You don't make any prior appointment , do you ? 
 Please tell your name , company and the nature of your business . 
 I see . Wait a minute , please . 

It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? 
 But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a job right now . 
 I've been fed up with study . 
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? 

How many people does your company employ ? 
 What's your annual turnover ? 

Well , Miss Li , it's time for us to say good-bye to each other . 
 I'm glad you could come to see us off . I have enjoyed your interpreting . You have done a wonderful job . I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here . 
 It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon . 
 Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon . 

How long has the company been in business ? 
 When did it become CABS ? 
 What does CABS stand for ? 

Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . 
 On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation . 
 On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide . 

Mr . Jackson , I've drafted a schedule for your business trip next week . You may have a look . 
 You're leaving on Tuesday morning . 
 Your flight takes off at 8 
 Yes , you're seeing him on Thursday . You're inspecting the factory in the morning and having dinner with him in the evening . 
 Oh , that's not everything . You're free on Friday and then on Saturday you're catching the 9 o'clock plane back to Guangzhou . 
 Hey , that's not fair . I did as much work as you . 

Amy , could you help me with this work ? 
 Okay . 
 Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier . 
 I'm free . What's up ? 
 Oh , I just remembered I've got a report to write . 
 Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? 
 I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March . 
 Don't worry about the cost . Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this . We need those parts urgently . Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ? 
 My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . 
 Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
 Good . Anything else ? 

Good morning , Mr . Chu . Would you like me to brief your schedule for today ? 
 You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference . 
 All right . Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you ? 
 The proposal is being repaired right now and I think it will be ready by tomorrow morning . 
 Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? 
 Only three days ? 
 What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ? 
 It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ’ d be different . 
 Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . 
 I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year . 
 No , thanks . 
 I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . 

Where are you employed ? 
 What do you think of your present job ? 
 How do you get to office ? 
 What does your work consist of exactly ? 
 Would you mind working overtime at night ? 
 How much money are you making a month ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 

You have worked in your present company for five years . 
 Why do you want to resign ? 
 What kind of work are you interested in ? 
 So you are interested in our company . 

Hi , Paulo . How are things going ? 
 That's good news . What stage are you at now ? 

We're going to have to postpone the meeting . 
 Mr . Chen can't make it today . 
 Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year . 

Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? 
 Have all the operators been trained on it ? 

We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend . 
 We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday . 

How many places have you worked altogether ? 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 
 What time do you go to work ? 
 What time does the office close ? 
 Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 

Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers . 
 When was it serviced ? 
 What's actually wrong with it ? 
 I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . 
 Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . 
 That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . 
 Is there anything you don't do in-house ? 
 Is that more expensive ? 

Are you doing the job the way I suggested ? 
 Well , have it your way . 
 Let's have a look . Oh yes , you need a 10 mm ring spanner . Here you are . Just leave it on the workbench when you finish . 
 No problem . 
 What size do you need ? 
 They're at the back of the stores , second shelf up on the right-hand side . 
 They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ? 
 I ’ ll need to check . Sorry , we don ’ t have any in stock . But I can order some and send through the order today . How many do you need ? 
 Fine . They should be here the day after tomorrow . 
 It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate . 
 Sure , but I have to finish this report first . 

I've just taken a spanner set from the stores . 
 Sorry , what do you mean ? 

Hi , Sven , can you help me ? Could you hold the end of the tape measure , please ? 
 Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . 
 Tell me what size you want and I'll order the wood . 
 Sure . So let's see . We need a piece of wood 3.5 m long by 1 m wide . I'll order it right away and I'll be able to install it next Tuesday . 
 I'm not sure . What does it look like ? 
 There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet . It might be in there . 
 What's going on over there ? 
 How long does that usually take ? 
 What's happening at the far end ? 

I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . 

Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit ? It's a clever design . 
 It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system . 
 Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . 
 This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . 
 What's the running speed of the machine ? 
 And what's the maximum output ? 

Is the factory fully-automated ? 
 What about supply of parts to the production line ? 
 What about the smaller components ? 

Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? 
 So , is it actually paper at this stage ? 

How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? 
 What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? 
 But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? 

Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? 
 What about your use of raw materials ? 
 What happens if you exceed the limits ? 

Hello , ABC Company . 
 I am sorry . He's out in a meeting now . Could I ask who is calling ? 
 He'll be back at about five in the afternoon . Could I take a message ? 
 All right , Mr . Smith . I'll be sure he gets your message . 
 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . 
 But Could you tell me when he will be back ? 
 well , do you think I could leave a message for him ? 

Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? 
 Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . 
 If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip . 
 When do you leave ? 

Good morning , Mr . Smith . Welcome to Wuhan . 
 Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ? 
 You must take a rest today . 
 We welcome good business . Anyhow , we know you must get tired by the flight , so we arrange a meeting tomorrow . Today you can have a good rest . 
 We hope your stay here a pleasant one ! 

Good afternoon . 
 Speaking . 
 Let me check my diary . Er . I'm afraid I can't make Tuesday . I've got to go to Beijing for a conference . I'll come back on Thursday . 
 Yeah , that would be fine . What time ? 
 Yeah , that's fine . Next Friday at 12 at Garden Hotel . I'll look forward to it . 
 Yes , I am . 
 How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you . 
 Thank you very much . 
 On the whole , not too bad . 
 Yes , I am , rather . But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to . Let's go . 

Anne , would you please come in for a while ? Please also bring along the minutes of yesterday's management meeting . 
 How long did the meeting last ? 
 Did the chairman ask for me ? 
 All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? 
 Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? 

Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? 
 What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? 
 I see , and how about the documents and the information ? 
 And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? 
 And after the meeting ? 
 It's seriously good . 
 Certainly , Mr . Baker . 
 Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ? 

Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . 
 Thank you . 
 For wood or for metal ? 
 Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? 
 Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . 
 Take your time , sir . I can wait . 
 So fast ! Thank you . 
 Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . 
 By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . 
 OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do . 
 Of course , Mr . Green . 
 No problem . I will do it immediately . 
 OK . Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style ? 
 I see . Anything else ? 

Owl ! I've twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I don't think it's broken but it really hurts . 

Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ? 

You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? 
 What about the packaging ? 

Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ? 
 I'll get the first aid box . There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there . 
 They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . 
 Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . 
 Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . 
 Yes , it's definitely a growing business . 
 Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . 
 Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . 
 No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . 
 By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . 
 Could I speak to Diana Curzon ? 
 This is John Laing from Dantons . 
 Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . 
 She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . 
 455623 . 
 That's right . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to speak to someone in your Accounts Department , please . 
 Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments . 
 No , it's Caxton . 
 Rosedale Investments . 
 It's R , O , S , E , D , A , L , E . 
 It's about an invoice which is wrong . 
 Um ... yes ... it's 856674 / ros . 
 That's right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 How do you spell that ? 
 Right . Got that . 
 Could you put me through to Dan Aykroyd ? 
 Could you leave him a message ? 
 Could you tell him that Horst Weissmuller phoned . 
 Of course . It's H , O , R , S , T , then W , E , I , S , S , M , U umlaut , L , L , E , R . 
 Just tell him I'll call him when I get back from Australia . That's it . 
 Thanks . Bye . 
 Could you spell that please ? 
 Cygnet . OK , I've got that . 
 How often do you service the vans ? 
 I see . What does the service involve ? 
 Can you carry out major repairs here ? 

Dentale Associates . I'm afraid there's nobody available to answer your call . Please leave your name and telephone number and we'll call you back . Please speak clearly after the beep . 

There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . 
 We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . 
 We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . 
 Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! 
 It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . 
 I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . 
 There's no power . 
 Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out . 

What's wrong with the photocopier ? 
 I need to make six copies of this report for the Board Meeting tomorrow . Ring Office Supplies and ask if they have any in stock . If they can't deliver this afternoon , I'll go and collect it . 
 I think the gears have seized up 

Are you looking for part time or full time employment ? 
 So you are interested in being with a company for the long term ? 
 Here is an application . Please fill it out to the best of your ability . Did you bring a resume and references ? 
 Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once . 

I have some great news ! I was able to switch to the night shift ! 
 I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start . 
 Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow . 
 Yes , I'll be managing the guys on the dock . 

Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ... 
 Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while . 
 Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ? 
 Well , that's kind of obvious . 
 Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? 
 Thank you . I'm from America . Here is my business card . 
 Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? 
 What about your company ? 
 My firm has high standing in my country . My bank is the City Bank , New York . You may refer to it for my status . 
 Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? 
 I'm in the electrical appliances . 
 Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . 
 Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . 
 That would be great . 
 That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry . 
 Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need . 
 Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority . 
 If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms . 
 Yes , surely . We hope to do some substantial business with you . 
 Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . 
 Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . 
 Good luck to us . 
 Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . 
 Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . 

I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there . 
 I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . 
 Actually , I am afraid I will be stuck in the job forever , if I choose a bad one . 

We're interested in your Drawn Works . What about the supply position ? 
 Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there . 
 I don't need to remind you that the market has become very competitive . 
 That's fine . By the way , do you quote FOB or CIF ? 
 Then would you please make your prices CIF including five percent ? 

We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list . 
 This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction . 
 Then what ’ s your counter-offer ? 
 We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . 
 How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? 

What do you think of our price ? 
 Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
 I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
 I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
 We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
 Yes , this is the best we can do . 

I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting A-l quality . 
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits . 
 Great , I'm glad we'll be able to do business together . I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning . 

How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? 
 But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . 
 Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? 

What are you doing here ? How about your resume now ? 
 Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ? 
 There is no need to do like this . We can surf the net and find some templates for resume . 
 You said it . We can also find some helpful advice from some experts . 

How's everything , Janice ? 
 Which company ? 
 Yep ! I got some , in which I am interested . But ... 
 YOU GET ME ! 
 Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow . 

Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do . 
 No . It isn't . 
 But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? 
 Yes , but nothing's happened . 
 I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ? 

I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me . 
 Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . 

The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database . 

Is that a no-smoking sign ? 
 What does that sign mean ? 

I ’ Ve been having problems getting onto the Internet . 
 Yes , they're fine . I suppose.the server might be down again . 

Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? 
 Should we use the stairs ? 

What should I do if I notice a fire ? 
 Should I try to put the fire out ? 

It's so earlier this morning , Mr . Li ! You just came back yesterday , you should have rest much more . 
 How about this post-trip ? 
 Really ? 
 OK , it's no problem . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 OK , please don't worry about it . You should set your mind at rest . 
 Thanks your flatter . 
 I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice . 
 Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? 
 I did clerical stuff and ran errands . 
 May I know about the office hours ? 
 Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ? 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime . 
 Good-bye . 
 I'll give you mine too . 
 Not bad , but I'm a little tired . 
 Could you arrange a meeting with your boss ? 
 Well , shall we get down to business ' . 
 Yes , we finished the evaluation of it . If the price is acceptable we would like to order now . 
 What's your best price for that item ? 
 I think the price is a little high , can't you reduce it 
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units . 
 The pleasure is ours . Can you deliver the goods by March 31 ? 

What is your strongest trait ? 
 How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? 
 What personality traits do you admire ? 
 What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrative personnel ? 
 How do you normally handle criticism ? 
 What do you find frustrating in a work situation ? 
 How do you handle your conflict with your colleagues in your work ? 
 To secure employment hopefully with your company . 
 I will stay as long as I can continue to learn and to grow in my field . 
 I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better . 
 People who are honest , dedicate to their work and have integrity . 
 Slacker and those who violate working procedures and ignoring deadlines . 
 Sorry , Mr . Smith agenda is full today . 
 I ’ m not sure , but I will arrange for you and inform you as well . 
 What problems are you having exactly ? 
 That is high . 
 But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market . 
 That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . 
 Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . 
 I was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions , training them in speech and organism , carrying our massage and physiotherapy , taking care of patients ' nutrition and diet . 
 They are sense of post , mentality quality , first aid ability , emergency adjustment , and law consciousness . 
 We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . 
 We can borrow as much as we can . 
 How much loan capital can we safely raise then ? 

Good morning . Elly company . 
 Hold on , please . 

I am glad to meet you , Mr.Joey . 
 That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ? 

What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How did your previous employers treat you ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs your have had ? 
 When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? 

You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you could manage ? 
 Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ? 
 Do you think you can speak English quite fluently ? Tell me about your English education . 

How many foreign languages can you speak ? 
 What do you think of your English ? 
 Can you speak English fluently ? 
 Did you take TOEFL or GRE ? 
 When did you begin to learn English ? 
 Do you think your English is good enough to do office work ? 

Are you familiar with American-styled accounting ? 
 What are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ? 

Your prices seem a little high . 
 We make a counter-offer to you of $ 150 per metric ton F . O . B . London . 
 OK . We will increase our order . 
 I'm glad that we've settled the price . 
 We think the price is too high . 
 We'll have to discuss it with my boss . 

In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . 
 Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . 
 That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . 
 Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . 

After probation , you'll find that our silk products feels more comfortable than others . 
 It's selling like hot cakes , and we have lots of regulars now . Would you like to place a trial order ? 
 Yes , we have the free samples for customers . And you can have a try . 
 Please wait a moment and fill out the order form . And we'll send you our sample . 

In foreign trade , language differences are very important . 
 Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . 
 In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . 
 Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . 
 So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . 
 Well , they consider some distinct but related problems , such as seeking for a target market or locating the promising customer . An exporter needs to know about the social characteristics of people he is dealing with . 
 Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow . Especially you need to know how they behave , their habits and their way of life , the things that they are used to . Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious . 

I am here to tell you that the clothes are very much to taste of our market and the customers are quite satisfied with the excellent quality . 
 Well , we have an extensive sales organization and a thorough knowledge of Asian market . Your products would sell very well here . We are prepared to do more business with you . We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you . 
 No problem . 
 My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company . 
 Oh , I'm sorry about that . 
 Don't worry , we'll soon fix them . 
 I'll certainly look into that . 

Come in and sit down . 
 Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . 
 I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too . 
 You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it . 

Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ? 
 What are the purposes of contract ? 
 When we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ? 

Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ? 
 You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . 
 I understand . 
 I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . 
 Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . 
 Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . 

May I come in ? 
 Hello , Mr . Liang . I've done with the work . My report is here so please give me new instructions . 
 Would you please have a look at my report ? I hope the project meets your demand . 
 If you have any questions about it , please don't hesitate to tell me . I'll go . Bye . 

We are very interested in your printed pure silk scarves , so could you introduce us your prices ? 
 Please send us your best offer and state payment terms and time of shipment . 
 I'm waiting . Your early offer will be highly appreciated . 

Good morning , Family . We'll have our board meeting this afternoon . Can you write the agenda on the notice board ? 
 We'll talk about the financial report for the first half of the year . 
 We'll also discuss the personnel plan for the second half of the year . 
 Yes . Please write them down on the notice board . I want everybody to see them . 

Were you a leader when you were in college ? 
 Did you get any honors or awards at your university ? 
 Were you involved in any club activities at your university ? 
 What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ? 

Would you mind telling me your grades in high school ? 
 Very good . What was your favorite subject in middle school ? 
 How were your scores in university ? 

What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 Why are you qualified for this position ? 
 What can you contribute to the position of a market analyst ? 
 What job-related skills do you have ? 

How about your grades of study ? 
 Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? 
 Have you ever been a student leader ? 
 Did it affect you much ? 

I see you just graduated from college . What was your GPA ? 
 Why do you think it wasn ’ t higher than that ? 
 Wo , wo , that certainly is a lot for a young man to take on . 
 Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you . 
 Thank you , they are beautiful . 
 OK . Would you like to file them according to dates ? 
 Yes , I will . 
 When do you expect it to be finished ? 
 All right . 
 Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . 
 I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability . 
 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm . When I get them involved with something constructive , some of them change their attitude later . 

We have been here for about five days and I have to leave now . 
 Yes , we have a very pleasant time . Thank you for being so nice for us . 
 No , thanks . You've done a lot for us . Thank you for everything . 
 Oh ! Thank you ! It's very kind of you . 
 We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you . 

The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . 
 But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . 
 Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . 

Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . 
 Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges . 
 Sure , Just push the button , like ... 
 I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today . 

Hi , Steven , take a seat ! How are things at work ? 
 Can you finish it on time ? 
 OK , I will send Beker to help you . We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay . 

Hi , Boss ! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day . 
 I think it's going very well , actually . We had a long meeting with them . After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer . 
 We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow , just to sort out some final details . 
 OK . I never forget it . 
 I have accumulated a wealth of practical experience in work as a chief advertisement designer . Moreover , I realized teamwork is the key to success . 
 I think building team spirit among the coworkers is very important . I believe we can accomplish a miracle if we stick together . 
 My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility . But I lack patience . 
 I will listen and learn more when I start my new job . I plan to become more professional in my field . 
 Thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn . 
 Great . Send it to me by FedEx tomorrow morning . Or better , call Federal Express for a pick-up . That way I'll get it even earlier . 
 Don't worry about that . I'll reimburse you as soon as I receive the package . 
 OK . 
 An exporter needs to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with . 
 What do they like or dislike . What languages do they speak , what religions do they follow . 
 Especially he needs to know their behavior , their habits , their way of life and the things they are used to . 

Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? 
 Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? 
 Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . 
 I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . 

Good morning ! May I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment with Mr . Smith ? 
 Wait a moment , please . I'll tell his secretary that you are here . 
 I'm sorry . He is holding a meeting until ten o'clock . 

This is Manager Liang's office , what can I do for you ? 
 OK ! I'll tell him . 
 Ok ! Thanks for calling . 
 Bye ! 
 Yes . There are several data documents about this contract . Please advise me which one I should give up . 
 I see . Thanks for your instruction . 

Susan , can you give me a hand ? 
 I want to create a password for this document . Please tell me how to do it . 
 What do I do after I've typed in my password ? 

There's a car waiting for you just outside the door . Right this way , please . 
 Let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back . 
 How was your flight ? 
 We'll reach the Beijing hotel in another ten minutes . When we arrived there , you can go up and have a rest . The hotel has very good service , and it's considered as one of the best hotels here . 
 If it's convenient for you , Mr . Wu would like to invite you to the banquet in honor of you in the evening . 
 At six o'clock in the International Hotel . We'll pick you up this afternoon . Besides , if you care for visiting , we'll arrange some sightseeing for you . 

Good morning , Helen . 
 So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? 
 What style will the ads be ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? 

What's your products ' competitive edge ? 
 We need your detail explanation . 
 It sounds good , and how about its quality ? We only look for the best . 
 OK ! How long dose it take you to deliver if we order 1000 pieces of silk ? 

Would you be willing to meet the extra cost if we meet your additional requirements ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet . 
 We never fail to meet our client's expectation . 

Hello , this is Than Hua's office . Can I help you ? 
 Speaking . 
 That's right . What can I do for you ? 

Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters . 
 That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me . 
 There are two shifts now in total . 
 We established the strict QC standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results . 
 Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift . 

I'm here to sign the agreement . 
 Can you speed it up and let us have it today ? 
 Let me have a look.Well , it contains basically all we have agreed upon . 
 I don't think so . 
 That's fine . 
 You know Mr . Forster , this is a really large purchase . I am afraid we can't pay off at one time . We have to pay by installment . 
 Yes , Mr.Forester . 
 We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments . 
 All right . 
 Ok , let's sign it . 
 I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations . 
 But what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ? 
 That's great . 
 I'd like to look it over before I sign it . 
 I am fully satisfied with the terms of this contract . 
 OK . Where do you want me to sign ? 
 OK . ( Sign ) Once a contract is signed , it has legal effect . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Mr . Thomas , this is a standard size . 
 Yes , we have plenty on hand right now . 
 OK , thanks for the order . 
 Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon . 
 We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery . 
 Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . 
 Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then . 

Why do you want to work in our company ? 
 Can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ? 

What qualities do you think a business manager should possess ? 
 If a client complains about the service of your department , what will you do ? 

Why did you choose Applied Sociology as your major ? 
 Have you taken the course in Public Relations when you are in college ? 

Is the room ready for the meeting , Miss Chen ? 
 How about the microphone and speakers ? 
 Good . Have you prepared some paper and pencils for the participants ? 

Mr . Li , I come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning . 
 By the way , the meeting will be held in your office . 
 Not at all . That's what I should do . 
 Yes , I worked as a doctor at Beijing People's Hospital . 
 A little over 3 years . 
 I worked in the Infection Medicine Division . 
 Fine . I have your letter and I've made some notes . 
 We have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population , consumption , production , and foreign exchange reserves . 
 But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . You can get much information about environment of investment . 
 Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . 
 The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . 
 Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 . 
 I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . 
 Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . 
 You're welcome . 
 I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . 
 I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . 
 I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . 
 Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . 
 There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . 
 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . 
 I can write computer programs , I have a good command of secretarial skills . 
 I have a doctor license and a driving license . 
 I passed both the Cambridge Examinations ( First Certificate and the Certificate of Proficiency in English ); and studied for a year in London at the Lucas Secretarial College , ending with speeds of 120 words per minute in English shorthand and 50 words per minute in typing . I was also trained in office procedure . 
 I ’ Ve received some special training in typing , shorthand and operating a fax machine , etc .. I ’ m experienced in IBM-PC . I can operate familiarly a word-processor , a fax machine , a photo and other office equipment . 
 Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton . 
 We're going to pay by check . 
 If you think it is necessary . 
 OK , no problem . 
 As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . 
 Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . 
 We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption . 
 Well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy . 
 She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills . 
 He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified . 
 Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . 
 Send it by the fastest way . 
 How much ? 
 OK . 
 Okay . What time is the meeting tomorrow ? 

We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break . 

Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ? 

Your definition on success ? 
 What ’ s your ideal job ? 
 How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? 
 How would your present boss describe you ? 
 What would your colleagues say about you ? 

What's your ideal boss ? 

And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? 
 Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? 
 What's your strong points ? 
 What do you dislike most about your job ? 
 What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? 
 Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? 
 How do you feel about overtime work ? 
 What is most important to you in a job ? 
 Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? 
 OK . What are your strong points ? 
 And your weaknesses ? 

Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to tonight's fashion show . 
 How very appropriate , because tonight we have a most dazzling show for you ! 
 Some of tonight's highlights are dressed in the latest straight from Shanghai . 
 So , sit back and relax and get your order forms ready . 

How do you get along with your boss ? 
 What do you think is important in your work ? 

I've heard that you are going to call for a tender . What kind of goods would you like to buy ? 
 When do you open the tender ? And where ? 
 And when is the closing date ? 
 Could you please tell me something more about the conditions for the tender ? 
 Thank you for your information . 
 I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time . 
 Okay , bye ! 

Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ? 
 Thank you , Mr . White . 

This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project , the cost and so on . 
 What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ? 
 Should we pay earnest money ? 
 Where do we submit the tender ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , is tender-opening done publicly ? 
 And are the prices stated in the US dollar ? 
 OK ! We will . Bye ! 

Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ? 
 How many years have you had the drivers license ? 
 That ’ s good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? 
 What computer languages have you learned ? 
 Have you gotten any special training in programming ? 

When you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? 
 Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . 
 That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . 

Steven , what's your idea of price ? 
 I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . 
 Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . 
 Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . 

How is your English ability ? 
 Could you tell me something about your English education ? 
 Have you passed College English Test Band 4 or Band 6 ? 
 Great . Can you file in English ? 
 You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ? 
 Excellent . How is your English ability in reading and writing ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 My mother is an English teacher in a college , so I began learning English when I could speak , and I took English as my minor subject at university . 
 Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . 
 And please let white color dominate . 
 Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . 
 Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . 
 Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . 
 Bye ! 
 Just what are you proposing ? 
 That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? 
 Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . 
 I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . 
 Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . 

What do you think of the project ? 
 Are you interested in making this investment ? 

What exactly is the problem with the latest lot ? 
 But we can't accept your damage claim . 
 You didn't note the damage on the bill of lading . 
 I need to think it over . 
 All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . 
 I suppose so , but don't rush . I've got to tell you how to do it . 

Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? 
 I am all ears . 
 Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . 
 A very good question . It's very honorable for me to tell you that our business relations cover all over the world and they all have very good business reputation . 
 We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it . 
 As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . 
 For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . 
 Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . 
 I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . 
 Sure , please hold on . 
 Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . 
 You are welcome . Bye ! 
 I ’ Ve only find a few openings in my field . 
 Unfortunately not . If I can ’ t find anything in that field , then I could also work in the marketing field . 
 Yes . 
 Really ? What is it ? 
 Do you think they'd hire me ? 

China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? 
 We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? 

Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . 
 In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 
 How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? 
 As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? 
 Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . 

What do you think of our price ? 
 Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
 I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
 I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
 We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
 Yes this is the best we can do . 

Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . 
 The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . 
 Thank you . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Agreed . 
 I understand your position . 
 I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account . 
 Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account . 
 The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year , so I ’ m very pleased . And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years . 
 Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on . 
 How do you do ? 
 OK . What's your working experience ? 
 How do your experiences benefit our company ? 
 Are you aware of the aspects of this position and do you feel you are qualified ? 
 If you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ? 
 Then , what starting salary do you expect ? 

Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . 

How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? 
 It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . 
 Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? 
 Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . 
 Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . 
 Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . 
 It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . 
 Why ? This is a fair market price . 
 Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . 
 We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . 
 But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . 

Are you Liu Yan ? 
 Have you brought your credentials ? 
 Let me have a look . 
 Your resume says you worked at DK Company for two years . What were you responsible for ? 
 Have you received any honorable title personally ? 
 Well , considering your qualifications , we believe you would be a suitable candidate . 
 All right . In my first teaching position I received the ' Excellent Teaching ' award the past two years in succession . 
 Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Prominent Youths of Beijing ' 
 Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Young Writer's Collection . 
 It is because of the quality . 
 I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? 
 The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . 
 I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . 
 Certainly . 
 It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . 
 Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . 
 Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . 
 Do not mention it . 
 It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ? 
 Yes , sir . Will there be anything else ? 
 Your document will be ready in about ten minutes . 
 Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . 
 For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . 
 This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives . 
 Technical barriers are set for imported goods . 
 Yes , some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food . 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 OK . But which size should I use ? 
 I see . Should I have it bound ? 
 That is all right . 
 How should I know ? It's not my responsibility . 
 Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well . 
 Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm ! 
 Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company . 
 Well , a working relationship . I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important . But I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss . 
 I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . 
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
 For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . 
 Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . 
 I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . 
 I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . 
 Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . 
 I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . 
 Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . 
 So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . 
 It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . 
 I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . 
 I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . 
 Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go . 
 Let me check - - oh , here it is . It just arrived a few minutes ago . 
 Is it important ? 
 Here it is , sir . 
 Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . 
 No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . 

Mr . Smith , while you're out , the sales department called and asked you to lunch next Wednesday . 
 Oh , yes , Miss Chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to July 11 and I've marked your diary accordingly . 
 Here is the agenda for the meeting and that's all for the messages . 
 I allocate different patients with their consent to different nurses . And I supervise the primary nurses and help nurses carry out their work . 
 To maintain a high standard of nursing , we should take experience and education into consideration while considering a nurse's level of expertise in caring for various patients . 
 Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . 
 I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . 
 Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . 
 Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent . 
 Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . 
 Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . 
 Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . 
 I can handle them without any trouble 
 Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . 

Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? 
 What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? 

I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? 
 Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? 
 We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? 
 We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? 
 Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? 
 That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . 
 How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . 
 Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . 
 That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . 
 I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? 
 All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . 

Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? 
 I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . 
 What's your proposal then ? 
 We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? 
 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . 
 What's your counter-offer then ? 
 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . 
 How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . 
 Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . 

We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . 
 This is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . 
 Then , what's your countr-offer ? 
 We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . 
 How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? 

I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses . 
 Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you . 
 Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies . 
 That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer . 
 So do I . 
 That is what I want to say . 
 Thank you ! 
 Shall I come to your office this afternoon ? 

Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . 
 Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... 
 Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... 
 You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . 
 Oh , how do you to Mr . White ? My name is Li Ming , here is my card . 
 We share the same desire . Have you seen the display of our products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? 
 Sure , we can . You know , we are been in the line for more than twenty years , and I think our price are competitive comparing with those in the world market . 
 Thank you for your information , we can hold more talks later on business details . 

Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting . 
 Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . 

Linda , have you prepared fully for tomorrow's meeting ? 
 Great , we don't expect any big problems to happen . 

Welcome to our company Mr white . My name is Yan Hua , the secretary of Mr Wang . 
 Would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? 
 We also hope to expand our business with you . 
 I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . 
 Right . Seeing is believing . 

Actually , I was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract ? 
 I got it , but nevertheless . what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ? 
 That sounds perfect for us . 
 I know how to use the telex machine , the photocopier , and the word processor . By the way , I took a computer course in university . 
 I want to be a manager . 
 Nothing . I think I'll take the job . 
 Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person . 
 I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
 It's the most important thing to me . 
 I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss . 
 Goodbye . 
 I want to be in a higher managerial position in the field of international marketing . I ’ m very interested in the European market hopefully , in Brussels . 
 It ’ s truly exciting to work in newly emerging unified market . Brussels will be center of the new market in the continent . 
 My experience in my last job showed that I have the talent to motivate people . It could be seen from the low absentee rate in my team . I want to continue that kind of contribution and to further develop this potential . 
 I want to apply my knowledge and experience to a challenging position and finally move on to management level . 
 I think the most important thing is the nature of the job . One should never do anything one is not interested in . To me , pleasant working conditions with co-operative staff are also important . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing . 
 Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years . 
 Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time . 
 To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day . 
 Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing . 
 I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future . 
 Fine . Thank you very much . 
 I would like to be in a managerial role , ideally working do6ely with external clients . I have worked in client-facing roles for more than two years and I enjoy the challenge of keeping the customer satisfied . I think Ifs something I ’ m good at . Finally , I ’ d like to be on the right career path towards eventually becoming a senior manger within the company . I ’ m very aware that these are ambitious goals , however I fell through hard work and dedication they achievable . 
 Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! 
 Nice to meet you too ! I am George Williams . 
 Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! 
 I will try my best to assist you if you need any help . 
 You are welcome . 
 Let me see , I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours . 
 What would a typical day be like for me here ? 
 Oh , yes , I do . My present job is similar in that respect , and I think I ’ m doing a good job . 
 Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short . 
 I wish to work in the planning department . 
 I expect to operate computers . 
 I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . 
 It's a twenty-minute bus ride . 
 I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . 
 I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . 
 I think so . 
 Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . 
 I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail . 
 People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . 
 Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . 
 I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . 
 I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back . 
 So ? 
 All right ! 
 Which ad would that be ? 
 Good , which job is that ? We advertised several openings . 
 Yes , it is . But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . Why don't you come in and fill out an application ? 
 We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application . 
 I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . 
 We're an Employment Agency . 
 They turned me down . 
 I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . 
 It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . 
 On the Internet ? I've never heard of it . 
 Is that safe ? 
 Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try . 
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . 
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . 
 Buy a decent suit . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . 
 Not much make up . 
 For the construction site manager ? 
 What happened ? 
 Well , no surprise there . 
 Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? 
 Great . Good luck . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English . 
 My name is B . How are you , Miss Kelly ? 
 Thank you , Miss Kelly . 
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . 
 Yes , I would . 
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . 

Is Betty Sue in her office ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . 
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? 

Do you have a free moment ? 
 I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? 
 Silly me . 
 Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? 

Good morning , Kate . Long time no see . 
 Kate , I know you ’ Ve been a stewardess for more than one year . And I ’ ll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow . Can you tell me some etiquette about the interview ? 
 Is there anything else I should pay attention to ? 
 Thank you , I've learned so much from you . 

Come in , please . 
 Good morning , please make yourself comfortable . 
 Your name and examination number , please . 
 Pardon ? 
 Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Can you leave me your phone number ? 

I'd like to start by talking about prices . 
 Your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high . 
 I know , but we want 1000 pieces . This is a very large order . So , can you give us a 25 percent discount ? 
 I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically . 
 I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute . 
 There are 3 secretarial categories here . One is receptionist , one is junior secretary , and the other is senior secretary . 
 I would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences , taking phone calls , and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs . 
 You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help . 
 I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun . 
 Actually I do . 
 Cooke & Co . does a lot of placements in your field . 
 Not at the moment , but I ’ ll let you know . 
 Yes , I'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education . 
 That's very generous . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the time you've given to me . 
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . 
 When will we get one of those ? 

How can we get in touch with you ? 
 About one week . 

What ’ s up ? 
 Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? 
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . 
 You can send a compressed one . 
 Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English . They say my English is quite good . 
 Oh , more than ten years . I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher . 
 Certainly . 
 I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . 
 I try to adapt myself . 
 I'll go and quit my job in the ABC Company . 
 I'm afraid not , but can you make it Thursday afternoon ? 
 Yes . See you then . 
 Hi , I am sorry to say that your experience doesn't fit the job at all . 
 I have to say your education and experience are very outstanding , but it seems that you are not good at working in a team which we attach great importance to . 
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . 
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . 
 Good idea . 
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 Yes , it will print immediately . 
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . 
 Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 

I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 
 Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ? 
 Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go . 

Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 

Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry . 
 Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . 

I am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company . 
 It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager . 

I am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company . 
 You are welcome , Please call me if you change your mind . 

Hello , is that Miss Lan ? This is Nina with Huawei Corp . 
 I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us . 
 I see . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 

Sit down , please . Mr . Tang , do you bring any paper or certificate with you ? 
 Are you still working in Youth International Travel Agency ? 
 How many foreign languages can you speak ? 

Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . 
 Yes . I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist . 
 As a journalist , I have strong communication skills . I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence . 
 We have a team to make itineraries of the tour , evaluate the value of it for one tourist and recommend the routine for different tourists . 
 Yes . There are selected itineraries for rich and high-tasted people , common routine for people who are on trade observation tour , and excursion routine for people who have limited time for sightseeing . 
 I'm Lui , I'd like to Speak to Mr . Smiths . 
 I'd like to speak to Mr Robert Smith . 

What qualifications should a reporter have ? 
 Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper . 

How do I make a good impression in the interview ? 
 Anything else ? 
 What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . 
 I see . 
 You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . 

Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! 
 Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . 
 No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? 
 Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? 
 Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . 
 Yes , I ’ m here for an interview as requested . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Thank you , madam . 
 It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview . 
 Yes , here they are . This is my ID card . This is my diploma . And this is my certificate for nurse qualifications . 
 I'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone . 
 I'm quite outgoing , I think . 
 I don't agree with someone else's opinion if I think he's wrong , but when I understand his thinking and see he has some good ideas , then I'm very happy to go along with him . 
 I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit . 
 I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years . 
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . 
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
 It's OK . 
 I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . 
 Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . 
 You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien . 
 Yes , please . I ’ m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please . 
 What was your major in school ? 
 Have you done any work in this field ? 
 What section did you work in ? 
 So you must be very familiar with export procedures . 
 That's good . 
 My chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends . 
 I think that the most important thing is you can ’ t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better . 

What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ? 
 What did you do to put it into practice ? 

Why do you want to be a teacher ? 
 In what department do you wish to work if we hire you ? 

How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click . 
 Ok . 
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . 
 Certainly , work always comes first . 
 Well , keep a low profile . 
 I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . 
 I believe every company has its own salary criterion . And you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances . 
 This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview . 
 I think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator . 
 Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . 
 Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . 
 I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . 
 You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 

Brian , a company called me for an interview . 
 How ? 
 Okay . 
 How expensive ? 
 I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? 
 How ? 
 Is a white blouse okay ? 
 Black ? 
 White pantyhose ? 
 Jewelry ? 
 How about make up ? 
 Perfume ? 

Do you have any sales experience ? 
 What kind of work are you doing now ? 
 Where are you working ? 

May I help you ? 
 I ’ m Smith , the manager of Human Resources Department . May I ask your name ? 
 Would you tell me what education background you have ? 
 Do you have any experience in this field ? 
 OK . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ? 

Did you see the woman that just left my office ? 
 She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . 
 I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . 
 Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . 
 Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . 
 We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . 
 Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . 

How about your grades of study ? 
 Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? 
 Have you ever been a student cadre ? 
 Did it affect you much ? 
 In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ? 

Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? 
 Yeah , that's very important . 
 I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . 
 It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . 
 But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . 
 It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . 
 I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . 
 It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . 

What are you typing there ? 
 Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? 
 Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? 
 Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . 
 But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . 

What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How did your previous employers treat you ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? 

Hello , Pratt . How was your interview yesterday ? 
 I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . 
 Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . 
 When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it . 
 Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . 
 Well , first I would like to know if this position is still available . 
 Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 
 How do you do , Mr . James ? Thank you for asking me to come in . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . 

Come in , young man . 
 I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? 
 Call me Mr . Smith . 

Are you married ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 Who are the members of your family ? 

Where do you live ? 
 What's your permanent address ? 
 Where is your birthplace ? 
 Where is your domicile ? 
 Give me your telephone number , please . 

I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board . 
 Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . 
 No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . 
 Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? 
 I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . 

Hello . May I help you ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? 
 This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . 
 Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . 
 Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . 
 My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . 
 Keep in touch . 
 For the bank manager ? 
 What happened ? 
 Well , no surprise there . 
 Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? 
 Great ! Good luck . 
 Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . 
 Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ? 
 As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing . Later , you will be assigned to the Sales Department . 
 For this is your first day in our company , you can begin with our special products . Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly . 

Good morning , sir . Have a seat please . 
 Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent . 
 Don't worry , sir . I think it's a seller's market right now . Let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ? 
 What is the square footage of your property ? How many bedrooms and living rooms ? 
 What is the orientation and view ? 
 The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house . 
 May I have your name and contact number , Sir ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I ask you one more question ? When will your property become available ? 
 Also , Mr . Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction . 
 Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call . 

I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too tight . 
 Why not ? 
 What are you talking about , we've tried everything ! 
 Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 Very well . 
 About five years . 
 There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales . 
 Yes , we are a small family business . 
 That depends on the day . We sell from here and on the Internet . I would say about twenty to thirty per week . 
 That's correct . 
 Thank you and goodbye . 
 Good Morning Mr Jones . 
 I will make it now . 
 I will bring the diary . 
 On Wednesday , you are going to London . Don't forget your train leaves at 9.30 am . 
 At 11.30 . And on Thursday Ms Von wants to talk to you . 
 She is our new project manager . She starts next week . 
 Hi , I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design . 
 Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen . 
 Yes , I prefer a more contemporary design . 
 Blue , green or earth tone colors . I do not like the colors that are too bright . 
 I'd like it to look simple , neat and relaxing . 
 No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ? 
 Of course . This is my card . See you then . 
 Just fill out an application . 
 You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .

 And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . 
 Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . 
 Oh , yeah , A . Thank you for approving my job . 
 Yeah , I believe it , but I want to know if you will give me a raise . 
 You are right , boss , but I need specific confirm to keep the future work better . 

Were you late for work this morning ? 
 What did you say to your boss ? 
 Your boss was really nice . 

You look upset.What ' s wrong ? 
 Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . 
 Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . 

Would you mail a letter for me ? My hands are full . 
 That ’ s fine . We ’ re going to drop in and see Jimmy tonight . Don ’ t forget it . 
 Thanks . See you . 

Good morning . Miss Lee . My name is Alex Jones . I'm the new assistant in the office . 
 Yes , I'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job . 
 This is wonderful . Thank you for doing all this for me , Miss Lee . 

I hear that you've got a chance to go to Europe for a half-year training program . Is it true ? 
 Congratulations ! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ? 
 How nice ! But will you have to pay for the training ? 

Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? 
 Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? 
 Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? 
 Okay , that's good . I get it . 
 Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers . 
 I can skillfully use Dos , Windows . 
 Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 . 
 Yes , I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer ’ s Qualification Certificate . 
 I like photography very much . I used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university .

 Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . 
 That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . 
 Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . 
 Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . 
 As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . 
 Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . 
 You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . 
 In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . 
 Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . 
 You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . 

Can you drive ? 
 Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? 
 One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . 
 Would you mind relocating ? 
 It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . Are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ? 
 Good . Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? 
 Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . 

I have a feeling you will get this job . 
 Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . 
 Have you updated your resume recently ? 
 You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . 
 Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ? 
 I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . 

Hello , Nancy , nice to see you . 
 Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job . 
 Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . 
 Don ’ t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language . 
 First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur .

 I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview . 
 Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance . 

How about the working hours ? 
 Can I ask for a leave ? 
 Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ? 
 That's OK . How can my salary be improved ? 

Please come in and sit down . I ’ m happy to finally meet you . 
 I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Thank you . Can I get you some coffee or a cup of tea ? 
 Good , then let ’ s get to the interview . 

Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 All right . When can I start ? 
 Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . 
 I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue , Chinese . 
 My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 . 
 I think so . 
 Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . 
 Why not ? It's the very reason why I've applied for this job . It's really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment . 
 They don't mind . 
 How do you do ? 
 Oh , no . It was easy . Your office sent me a map . 
 That ’ s OK . Thank you for seeing me . 
 Thank you . 
 OK . 
 I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month . 
 Does it include bonuses ? 
 Very good . 
 ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . 
 Thank you . Have you received my resume ? 
 Of course , here you are , sir . 
 Certainly , it would be my pleasure , Mr . Smith . 
 Same here . I've been looking forward to this . 
 No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic . 
 Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice . 
 My full name is Zhang Yong . Zhang is the surname or family name .

 My present address is No . 415 Green Street . This is also my permanent address . 
 My telephone number is 4837625 . 
 I'm from Guangdong . 
 My birthday is June 14th , 1985 . 
 Yes , it's true . 
 It's a branch of the Bank of America in Beijing . 
 The applicant must be alert and quick at figures , and like meeting the public .

 Yes , starting salary is 6,000 yuan a month plus bonuses . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I have been married for three years . 
 There are three people in my family . 
 My wife , my daughter and I . 
 Working for your company , as the top administrative assistant in your firm ! 
 Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . 
 My major is Business Administration , I am especially interested in Marketing . 
 I attended Suzhou University . 
 Yes . I received my Bachelor degree in Business Administration . 
 Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . 
 Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . 
 I passed college English Test Band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer . I think , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I'm quite familiar with Microsoft Office 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . 
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! 
 I know . But hard work pays off , you know . 
 Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . 
 I am studying at Beijing University . I major in Civil Law .

 I think I have a good understanding of fundamentals in the areas your company deals with , and I can go on from here to build up the specific skills and knowledge I need to do my job well . 
 Yes . I did some work on that , and I found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . I was sure I had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . 
 Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! 
 Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith . 
 Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help . 
 You are welcome . 
 How nice of him . I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? 
 That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose . 
 Goodbye and see you tonight . Miss Rose . 
 Yes , what's wrong ? 
 Today is September 28th , 2007 . 
 When will it begin ? 
 It is half past one . 
 Don't worry , time is enough . 
 That's true . I got the news yesterday . 
 You're flattering me . 
 Not bad . I'm confident . And I like challenges . 
 Thank you . 
 Good morning . What time is it now ? 
 I'm on time today 
 Yes , quite often . 
 No , I left home at 6:30 as usual . 
 Because the traffic is not crowded . 
 How should I get their contact info . 
 Where should I put them up ? 
 The clients like the Shangri-La Hotel more . 
 What else would I prepare , Sir ? 
 Certainly . 
 Of course . I'm on it 
 Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . 
 Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . 
 I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . 

Jane , the meeting is scheduled from 1:00 this afternoon . Have you made the necessary arrangements ? 
 That's right . The meeting is very important . Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins ? 
 We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . 
 Really ? I'll also try to speak slowly . How would you arrange the guests ' seats , Jane ? 
 Well , after my report , there will be an interval for rest and refreshments . 

Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . 
 Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . 
 Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? 
 We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? 
 Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? 
 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . 
 You mean to saya 
 We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . 
 Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . 

That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . 
 To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us . 
 Excellent . Have you had French food before ? 

So , now we have covered all the important points . 
 Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details . 
 Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。 
 Yes ? 
 No problem . I ’ ll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback . In addition , would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment ? 
 Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid . 
 Then I ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it . 

What's your working day like ? 
 Do you get paid overtime ? 
 Do you have any breaks ? 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ? 
 Yes , I do . I don't like it very much . 

Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? 
 The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? 
 That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? 

Excuse me . My name is Richard Davis of Magic Office Supplies . I'm here to see Mr.Chen . 

I had a job interview this morning . 
 Pretty well , I think . 
 Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . 
 Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . 
 Can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ? 
 The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen . 
 I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ? 
 Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things . 
 Here is the catalogue and the price list . You can take a look . 
 No problem . 

We can offer you a 5 % discount . 
 Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? 
 What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . 
 How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . 

We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . 
 Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? 
 But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . 
 Could you make it $ 4500 ? 
 Can we meet each other half way ? 
 Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? 

We are interested in your pure silk , but I'm wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ? 
 That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ? 
 Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ? 
 That would be nice . Let's call it a deal . 
 What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well . 
 $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . 
 You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . 
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . 

Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? 
 What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . 
 What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? 
 You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? 
 I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . 
 Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . 
 I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ? 
 Thank you . 
 That's right . Let's go into details of it . 
 Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? 
 Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . 
 They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . 
 I'm sorry . 
 By the middle of October . This is the best we can do . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . And we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early September . 

Hello ! Is Mr . Green there ? 
 This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . 
 Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? 
 What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? 
 Any time you say is OK . 

Hi ! May I help you ? 
 In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . 
 Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . 

To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . 
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 
 You can rest assured of that . 
 Yes . Is this your new product this year ? 
 When is the product going to be on the market ? 
 So soon ? It seems to be in the early stages . 
 Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that . 
 Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . 
 I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . 
 I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . 
 Ok . 
 You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . 
 Yes . They usually do it . 
 Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . 
 They do the work without charge to the importer . 
 Exactly . 
 No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . 
 You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . 
 You are welcome . 
 What's up ? 
 Why don't you go ? 
 I see . I'll do it for you . 

What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? 
 Have you worked in a computer company before ? 
 Do you have any ideas on this work ? 
 Good ! 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s your name ? 
 You have been in Peking University , hadn't you ? 
 What degree do you have now ? : 
 Do you have any experience in this field ? 
 Why are you interested in the position ? 
 All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? 

Why do you want to be a tour guide ? 
 What courses have you completed at college ? 
 Have you learned any other foreign languages ? 
 Do you know that is a hard job ? 
 Is there anything you want to ask about ? 

You are still a student ? 
 Are you sure you can be a successful cashier ? 
 That's only for your theory foundation . I am afraid if you have ever handled large amounts of cash before ? 
 Good . I think you'll make a good cashier . 

Hi , I am so glad to see you . 
 You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . 
 I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? 
 Then what else should I put into my resume ? 
 I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? 
 I see . Is that all there is to it ? 
 Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . 
 That's easy . 

What do you think about our company ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 In what business are you most interested in this organization ? 

Have you had any experience with sales work ? 
 What exactly did you do at that company ? 
 Did you like your work ? 
 But when and why did you leave the company ? 
 I see . Why did you choose our company ? 

Where did you study accounting ? 
 Did you intern anywhere ? 
 That must have been stressful . 
 I'll bet . 

What does Human Resources Department do ? 
 They take care of a lot of things . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 OK . 
 I see . 
 Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . 
 You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database . 
 Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while . 
 What is it ? 
 Let ’ s see ... ' Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Betty Sue . ' Oh , I don ’ t know ... 
 What about my resume ? 
 Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . 
 Please , call me Ted . 
 That ’ s no problem . 
 Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? 
 I see . 
 Sounds fine . 
 Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . 
 More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . 
 It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . 
 Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? 
 How about sick days ? 
 Any other benefits ? 
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . 

Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? 
 I am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of Project Manager . 
 By the way , are you married ? 

Were you engaged in any activities at college ? 
 What kind of activity would make you get involved ? 

Have you got any certificate of technical qualification ? 
 How long did it take you to get your driver's license ? 

That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . 
 When we have the final results , we will call you . 
 If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . 
 I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . 
 I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . 
 Your mentality is very good and that's great . 
 My pleasure . 
 I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas . 
 Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . 
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
 You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . 
 I'll do my utmost if I am hired . 
 No , that thought doesn't cross my mind . 
 Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything . 
 I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future . 
 Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ? 
 Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . 
 Thank you very much . 

Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . 
 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . 
 Professional suits may be the best choice . 
 Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . 
 Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . 
 Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . 
 In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . 
 Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton . 
 But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . 
 OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . 
 Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine . 
 Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college . 
 That's great . You need to prepare for it . 
 Buy an expensive suit . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes . 
 You should wear a tie to go with your suit . 
 It doesn't matter . Just do your best to sell yourself . 
 Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . 
 I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later . 
 I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . 
 People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . 
 Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . 
 Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . 
 Yes . I want to rent a formal suit for an interview . Can you give me some advice ? 
 May I try this on ? 

Hey , Michael . Remember me ? I'm Becky . We used to work at Lemans together . 
 It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? 
 Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? 
 Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . 
 Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . 

I want to rent a formal suit here.Do you have a purple dress here ? 
 I am a size 6 . 
 This is just my size . How much is the rent 

I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . 
 It looks like the shipping company did this . 

We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . 
 The material was not damaged by us . 

Just whose fault is this damage ? 
 It certainly didn't arrive here that way . 
 How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? 
 I was thinking of 30 % off . 

Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? 
 How long is my paid vacation every year ? 
 What about the insurance and housing policies ? 
 How often is the bonus ? 
 Do I have training opportunities ? 
 Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think for a couple of days before I give you my final answer . 
 Ok , thank you for your time and patience . 

Why do you choose our company to apply for a job ? 
 Have you got a clear idea about our company ? 
 Have you tried other companies ? 
 Will you take a job which is not in line with your major ? 
 How long would you work here if you were admitted ? 
 Do you expect a high salary ? 

Mary , this company is pretty good . I really want to have an interview . 
 Not yet . Do I have to ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Sure . Why didn't I think of that ? 
 Then how can I make the appointment ? 
 Ok , I see . 

What should you do if you find out a man may has an illegal departure in exit control point ? 
 What else do you need to keep him in temporary custody ? 

Hello , is that Susan who applied for an accountant in our company through the phone ? 
 I am the HR manager of the ABC Company . You are on the list of interviewees . Would you please come over to have an interview ?

 I want to know whether you will come to the interview . So have you accepted offers from other companies ? 

Bruno's . 
 Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ? 
 Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back . 
 No , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge . 
 The cake is no problem at all , but we do charge a corkage fee of $ 15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant . 
 Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ? 
 Thanks , Mr . McQuillin . I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements . 
 Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd . 
 Oh , yes.Thank you . I'd be glad to . 
 I'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot . 
 OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I . 
 My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .

 I feel terrible now .

 The fringe benefits in your company are excellent , and it's generous of you to offer five insurances and one fund 
 I want to know if the staff can get a vacation every year . 
 That's quite good . Thank you for telling me about those . 
 Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . 
 Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . 
 Yes , I know a little about Japanese which is similar to Chinese not only in culture but in language itself . 
 I passed the Band two in LPT , but I will try to achieve Band one which is the highest level .

 I want to be a lawyer in the future and the Law School was one of the best schools in Harvard . 
 I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement . 
 It is quite important for all of us . Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future . 
 As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts . 
 I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time . 
 Salary is , admittedly , important , but I will care more about what I can learn from the job . 
 I would take it . After all , interest is not the only thing one should care about . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . 
 Bye . 
 I chose the Institute of Foreign Language . 
 There were a number of them , such as Department of Literation , Department of Journalism and Communication , Department of Art Design , etc . 
 I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .

 I think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life . 
 And I can experience another kind of life style . 
 I hope I can adapt to the new job as soon as possible . 
 Yes , this is Jin Lili . What can I do for you 
 There is too much static on the line . 
 Pardon ? I can hardly hear you . I will call you later . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . 
 I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . 
 I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . 
 I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty . A sincere desire to become an administrative assistant is the heart of my career plans . 
 Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . 
 I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . 
 It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? 
 Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? 
 Is there probation ? 

Good afternoon . How can I help you ? 
 Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . 
 Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the questionnaire and it lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . 
 Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . 
 Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily . 
 More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . 
 I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ? 
 Yes . Our price can't be matched . 
 If you buy 1,000 or more , you'll get a 10 % discount .

 You can contact me any time you need me . Bye ! 

Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? 
 Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . 
 If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . 
 I hope you'll give a second thought to it . 
 What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? 
 About 300 dozens . 
 OK . That's a deal . 
 Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . 
 Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . 
 No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . 

Hi , is that Jessica ?

 I am applying for the waiter in your pub .

 I have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours . 
 Please ask . 
 For this position we prefer e-resume at the very beginning . Please send it to our department ’ s e-mail box . 
 You ’ re welcome .

 Yes , that's right . 

Could you tell me something about your previous job ? 
 Didn't you like it ? 
 What made you make a decision to leave ?

 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 
 It owns 10 factories and offers stocks to the public . 
 I have a proven track record in resolving problems , multitasking , and dealing with customers , as you can sec in my resume . I think it is enough .

 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 It is so terrible to be caught unaware . 
 Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply . 
 State your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details . 
 If you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . 
 Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly . 
 It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . 
 Working conditions are very relaxed . You may work whatever hours you want , provided you get your job done properly . 
 Would you mind changing the position or working place you've applied for ? 

Is there any chance to further study ? 
 Do you have training program or plan for employees ? 

When should I come for work in the morning ? 
 When does the job start in the afternoon ? 

Confronted with difficult questions in an interview , the job-hunters mostly will be at a loss about what to do . 
 Still , there are some rules to follow . 
 Don't get nervous and freaked out . 
 There should be neither too much silence nor hasty answers 
 Don't be discouraged even when confronted with negative questions 
 Anyway , what really matters is that you have tried your best . 

Do you plan to further your study ? 
 If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company . 

Did you work in a charity organization ? 
 In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ? 

So , where can I start my work ? 
 And I represent ? 
 Ok , thank you . 

Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? 
 These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . 
 It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . 
 Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . 
 Yes , it ’ s right . 
 Yes , I think so too . 
 Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . 
 I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live . 
 That would work too . 
 Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . Will this company do so ? 
 I understand . Will the company provide training ? 
 That's great . Thank you very much . 
 No . I don ’ t . Please . 
 I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet . 
 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure .

 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . 
 Mr . White , too . 
 I just had a complete physical examination and passed with flying colors . 
 I understand that . 
 I feel my greatest asset is perseverance , that is , the ability to stick to things to get them done . 
 I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turned out just as I'd planned .

 Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .

 Other company rules also need your attention . 
 Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 I have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses . 
 I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income . 
 Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . 
 Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . 
 In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . 
 Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . 
 Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment . 
 Smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments .

 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . Oh , it tastes nice .

 The company will assign you housing subsidies at 400 yuan a month . 
 Surely it is . 
 You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words . 
 Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous . 
 The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . 
 Throughout the interview you should maintain patience . 
 Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success . 
 Still , you should not let down your guard . Some details should be paid attention to . 
 You can also ask the interviewer about your performance today . 
 And it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary . 
 You can ask questions about the position you are applying for . 
 Of course . 
 Besides , remember to make acknowledgments through an E-mail or a call . 
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities .

 To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . 
 It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . 
 While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately 
 Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . 
 We have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis . 
 Yes . Floating bonus is the kind of bonus that is indeterminate in amount , such as quarterly bonus , bonus at the end of the year . 
 Don't worry about such problems . We can deal with them for you . Other questions ? 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes , sure . To be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . However , we have to if it is necessary for our company . I would do that if it is the call of duty . 
 OK , I completely understand . 
 Yes , you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job . 
 No , but we ’ ll provide you with good businesses at the end of the year .

 I will . Thank you for all . 
 I think so , but how should we write it ? 
 Yes , it should be so . Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement . 
 We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job . 
 Oh , you have recommended yourself very well . I should think about how to recommend myself as well . 
 Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings . 

I am rejoiced to tell you that you are employed . 
 You are expected to report for on-job training on the 15th of May . Will you be there ? 

I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position . 
 Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ? 
 I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision . 
 As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect . 
 I am too introverted to let others become my friends . 
 What's the matter ? Please tell me . Maybe I can help you . 
 Don't worry . I know about this . 
 First you should have a salutation , which can be the company's or a person's name . 
 Then you can write about his performance in college , including his academic achievements and his competence . 
 You can also state his personality traits , hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on . 
 You can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter . 
 You should also state that you are his class president , so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter 

What do you consider to be your weakness ? 
 Anything else ? 

So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? 
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . 
 Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . 
 Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . 
 Good morning , this is Jane . This is Apple Co . Ltd . 
 Yes , this is . May I help you ? 
 Oh , the results have come out , and I can tell you ... Yes , I find your name . You are hired . Congratulations ! 
 Next Monday morning . 
 Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher . 
 See you ! 
 I'm glad to see you ! 
 Yes , I know . 
 Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ? 
 It sounds great ! 
 OK . 
 How long will the induction training be ? 
 I see . 
 OK . 
 It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? 
 Well , I doubt that . 
 I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . 
 I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . 
 My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field . 
 In order to achieve that objective . I would work step by step and make further study . 
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 You certainly made a good impression on me as well . 
 We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible . 
 That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? 
 I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . 
 I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . 
 Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . 
 I wish you good luck ! 

Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy ? There are some figures I want to check . 
 Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . 
 Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper . 

Hello , take a seat please . Let's get straight to the point . This is our contract . Please read it carefully before signing . 
 May we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice . 

I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday . 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions . 

Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview . 
 I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? 
 Good idea . It is convenient and fast . 
 Certainly . 
 I think that about one hundred words are enough . 
 OK , I know now . 
 Pleased to meet you , Mr . Farley . 
 OK May I ask whether there is probation ? 

I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . 
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? 

We are happy to have you with us . When could you start working ? 
 What about Next Monday ? 

Hello , this is Sunshine Trading Company . Can I help you ? 
 Great . Could you tell me something about cash control ? 

Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? 
 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? 
 Have you updated your CV ? 

Good morning . Please come into my office . 
 I see that you have some impressive writing experience . 
 Wonderful . I'd like to know why you're interested in this position at our paper . 
 OK . Let me send a memo around . 
 I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . 
 I know , it ’ s a big one . 
 Can't complain . And you ? 
 Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . 

Evan , are you busy right now ? 
 Well , I need a hand with the fax machine . My fax is not going through . 
 Ah , thanks . 
 well , I ’ m very good with people . I ’ m honorable . I work hard . I work well under pressure . And I ’ m patient . 
 I like a person who works hard . I don ’ t like lazy people . 
 well , this is a challenging question . I suppose I would say that I ’ m a quick learner . 
 I think so . I think that I am good at what I do . 
 I ’ m not good at speaking in public . I feel uncomfortable when I speak in public . 

How do I know if there is a vacancy in a company ? 
 Which websites are most popular ? 

Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment with her ? 
 Okay . What ’ s your name , please ? 
 Thanks . Please sit down . She ’ ll be with you shortly . 

Hi , Sarah . The results of questionnaire have come out . We need to discuss it together then write a research report . 
 30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing . 
 Almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little . 
 Absolutely . 
 But why ? 
 OK , I see . 
 Yes , that will be just as good . 
 All right . Then I can do some shopping today before going back to my country . 
 Yes . I ’ m interested in a job your company posted on the Internet . 
 It is a position in your Maintenance Department . Is it available ? 
 I have no experience but I ’ m interested in it . 
 I don ’ t have my resume with me , but I will send you a copy immediately . Can I fill out the application form right now ? 
 Thanks . 

Hello . Can I help you ? 
 Yes . We ’ ll close this position posting at the end of this month .

 It ’ s on the first floor , Room 120 . 
 Good luck . 

Hi , how are you ? 
 That's for sure . You're new , too , huh ? 

Good morning , Mr . Montgomery . I've been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . 
 Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! 

Joe , can you squeeze me in sometime today ? 
 I know what you're saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . 

Excuse me , are you Mrs . Green from England ? 
 I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you . 
 How do you do ? 
 Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ? 
 It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here . 

How can I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p . m . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? 
 Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? 
 Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor.There is a conference room already prepared . 
 I've been looking forward to visiting your factory . 
 That'll be most helpful . 
 How much do you spend on design development every year . 
 That's fine . 
 Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8: 00 . 
 That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too , Ms . Green . This company seems so big right now ; I don ’ t know how I ’ ll ever get used to it . 
 Great – That ’ ll be big help . 
 It's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Lucy . 
 Yes , I'm from Salt Lake City . 
 I'm glad to hear that . I think it's the nicest city in the United States . 
 Yes . My name's Mark Benson . I just started a couple weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 Could you explain in detail ? 
 How about 60 % for the first load , then 20 % each ? 
 It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms.Barkley . 
 7880 Crofton Avenue , Building 40A , Room 304 . 
 Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? 

I've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to Dalian . A part of the goods were damaged in transit . 
 Please handle future shipments with more care . 

When can you get the finished product to me ? 
 Great ! That'll be ahead of schedule ! Good work . 

Well , I'm glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I'm really not in a position to make a decision right now . 
 Yeah , why don't you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week . 

Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us . 
 I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . 

Hi , Mark ! I was wondering if you finished that presentation you were working on last week ? 
 Mr . Rodriguez was asking me about it yesterday . 

I'm calling to tell you the shipment has arrived in good condition . 
 Quite satisfied . I'm looking forward to our future cooperation . 
 Has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ? 
 Excuse me , what is this ? 
 Are the batteries in it made by your people ? 
 What kind of battery is it ? 

Mr . Carmichael , this is Ellen Bower calling again . You had said I should call this week to schedule an interview with you . 
 I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I'd be glad to make it some time next week . 

Where do you work ? 
 Are you a doctor ? 

Hello , Mr.Green . This is Lin Tong . How are you ? 
 Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting . 
 Thanks a lot . You have been here for almost three weeks . How time flies ! 
 It is our pleasure . It has been a great pleasure to work with you . 
 Really ? Great ! We will . Well , what's your flight number ? When are you leaving tomorrow ? 
 OK , I will send someone to see you off . 
 My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip . 
 Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye . 

Welcome to China , Mr . Martin . 
 I am very glad that you say so . We have prepared a typical Chinese dinner this evening . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , What can I do for you ? 
 Welcome to our corporation . I'm in charge of the export business . 
 I'm In Hui . Do sit down , won't you ? 
 We'd be very glad to do so . Have you seen the exhibits displayed in the hall ? 
 Yes , of course . If you make an inquiry , we can make you a firm offer . 

I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight . Do you think you'll have time ? 
 Which kind of food do you like to eat , Chinese food , western food or seafood ? 
 OK . I will pick you up at your hotel at 5:30 p . m . 
 See you later . 

I heard you've found a new job . 
 So you're quite happy with your new job ? 

I don't believe we've met . 
 My name is Gao Run . 
 Here's my name card . 
 It's nice to finally meet you . 

Will you introduce me to the new colleague ? 
 No , we haven't . 

Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department . 
 You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding . 
 You ’ Ve got a great personality . 
 I believe you will . I ’ m very pleased with your work . Your promotion will contribute to the development of the company . 

Hello ? 
 Yes . 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 I'm terribly sorry , but I've already made arrangements for Wednesday . 
 That would be fine . 
 Whenever is suitable for you . I have no plans for that day . 
 And where would you like to meet ? 
 I'm not very familiar with Chinese cuisine . What can you recommend ? 
 Of course ! Peking Duck is world-famous . I would love to try it . 
 All right . Well , I'll see you later . 

How are you , Mr . Zhang ? 
 Fine , too , thanks . We met one year ago . We both took part in a party held by our company last year . 
 Me too . How is your family ? 
 Say ' hello ' to them for me . 

Here is an invitation for you . 
 Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company . Our general manager invites you to a dinner party . Do you think you can manage it ? 
 That is great . Dinner starts at 6 
 All right . Bye . 

Are you from America ? 
 Yes . Nice to meet you ! 
 Thanks , I will appreciate it . How long have you been here ? 

The time has come to say goodbye . 
 I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . 
 I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights . 
 You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? 
 I'll be expecting you then . 
 What time would you like to see him ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'll check for you . 
 No one . 

Did you get my email ? 
 Sure . 
 Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
 I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! 
 I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . 
 Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! 
 No , should I have ? 
 Thank you for your entertaining me . 
 Excuse me , what business are you looking after in Germany ? 
 What arts and crafts are you interested in this time ? 
 Sure , I'll certainly help you do it . 
 Oh , thank you . 
 That will be best . I'd like to have a good rest first . 
 Ok . Shall we discuss the schedule in the lobby ? 

So , Emily , how was your day ? 
 It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 That's not very fair . What did you do ? 
 Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? 
 Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? 
 Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? 
 That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . 
 That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . 
 Oh . 
 Sure . 
 The train ? Will I be flying back then ? 
 Will the train be very crowded ? 
 When is the first meeting then ? 
 Where will I be staying ? 
 That's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? 

Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? 
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? 
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 
 You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? 
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . 
 That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then . 

Good afternoon , Mr.Stein . I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ? 
 Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . 
 I'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 . 
 It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow . 
 That's it . I am Maria Smith . You must be Zhang Lin from Tianjin Sports Facility Co.Ltd . 
 Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang . 
 Hello , this is Catherine . I am calling about the appointment with Mr . Liu for this afternoon . Something has just come up . I am afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled . I am very sorry about the change . 
 You are very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon . Um ... When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? 
 Yes , that's quite all right for me . Can we change it ? 
 Thank you very much . See you tomorrow afternoon . 

My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! 
 Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . 
 You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . 

I have applied for a transfer . 
 Yes . I think it's time to move on . I ’ Ve already been here too long . 
 Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office . 
 Thanks . It's been a pleasure working with you . 
 Good morning . 
 Very well . What about you ? 
 That is so nice of you . 
 Well , I know you are pretty busy these days . But we have got to work fast on this . Otherwise , we'll lose the market . 
 Let me see . That is no problem . I'll see you then . 
 I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ? 
 Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ? 
 You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB 
 Thank you . It was a lot of hard work.But I'm glad I did it . 
 When will you give me a raise ? 
 I feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly . 
 5 000 yuan per month . 

Excuse me , sir . I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation . 
 I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment , but I've decided to study abroad . 
 Thank you , sir . I'd like to say that I ’ Ve really enjoyed working with you . However , I think it ’ s about time for me to leave . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . 
 So can I expect to hear from you to set up an appointment for an interview sometime next week ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 

I'm sorry to tell you that I have to cancel our appointment . 
 I must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon . 
 OK . I'll be free from nine to eleven . I'll be there waiting for you . 
 Sure . I'm really sorry for the trouble I've made . 

Please come in , Steven .

 But , our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 You're the sales manager , but our sales didn't go up . 
 I feel sorry , but that's the decision of the directorate . 
 I ’ m looking for a job . Are you hiring ? 
 Superintendent . 
 Do you have any other positions available ? 
 What is it ? 
 Can I apply for it right now ? 

I'd like to make an appointment with manager Mr.Wu . Would 10:00 a . m . tomorrow be all right ? 
 Could I possibly make it early in the afternoon ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . I want to apply for a job you posted on the Internet yesterday . 
 Service Technician . How can I apply for this position ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Okay . Thanks .

 I'll be waiting for you in our office about nine o'clock . 

May I speak to Mrs . Liu , please ? 
 Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email .

 You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that . 

Is it possible that I have a business trip abroad and work in American once in a while ? 
 Is there any training program for the employees to make a further study ? 

What are the requirements that you need to do the job ? 
 I can handle that . I can operate word - processor , fax machine , photostat , and other office equipments . 
 I have a master's degree and I meet all the needs you want , so I am confident of doing this job well . 
 The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely . 
 Great . Welcome to our company . 
 With my experience , I'd like to start at 3,000 RIB per month . 
 I think you will find I am worth it . 
 Normally , about 60 people . But it may depend . 
 About 20 % of them come from other countries and the others are employed from domestic universities and colleges . 
 Basically I get 5,000 RIB every month . It is a well-paid job with satisfying working hours . 
 I require 6,500 RIB per month as a start . This is my bottom line , the minimum salary I can accept . 
 I go to the personnel market every day , and put a lot of energy into it . 
 On the Internet ? I have never tried that way . 
 So how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 But how can I know which employer is hiring ? 
 Will the employers see my information ? 
 Is it safe to job hunt on the Internet ? 
 I will give it a try at once . 
 I have chosen 15 candidates . The first round interview is tomorrow . 
 Right . We'll choose the 4 best candidates and have them come back for a second interview . The top one of them will be the one we will hire . 
 It will be held on October 15th . 
 You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place . 
 Yes , they have been concerned about me finding a job . 
 They want to recommend some jobs to me . 
 My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company . 
 My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now , and she wants me to give it a try . 
 One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview . 
 I know . Let me think it over . 
 I will . 
 Wait a minute . I will get him here . Sorry , he is busy doing something . Why don't you give him a ring later ? 
 You are welcome . 
 According to their scheme , it will begin on September 10th . 
 Yes , it is much earlier than past years . 
 Not exactly . Our address is ' www . zhilian-zhaopin . com . CN ' . 
 Of course . The website is ' www . zhilian - zhaopin . com . CN ' . 
 What did he say ? 
 What kind of intermediary is it ? 
 What job did he recommend to you ? 
 Does he ask you to pay some fees ? 
 Then what do you think about it ? 
 Sure , but you must verify that first and don't easily make a promise . 
 Good luck ! 
 Operations is made up of Manufacturing , Materials , Shipping and Distribution etc . 
 Yes , it is . 
 The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 The core values are credibilities , team work , diligence and devotion . 
 Yes , we are a foreign-invested company . 
 The supreme goal of ours is to be in the leadership in marketing . 
 Yes . We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal . 
 Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market . 
 Really ? I have been there several times . 
 Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers . 
 Yes , there are many famous corporations . 
 Every Saturday and Sunday 
 No , it's free . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Yes , I know it is one of the leading industries in the petrochemical field . 
 Yes , I hope I will be a manager in 5 years . 
 External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . 
 The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc . 
 Yes , do you know the nine to five timetable ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 yes , it's a good company . But the management changed last month . We didn ’ t get along , so I quit . 
 I'm qualified for this position . And I've heard a lot of good things about your company . 
 You take care of your employees . And your company offers good salaries and benefits . 
 I've got over seven years ' experience working in this kind of position . I know I can do a good job in this position . 
 Do I have to wear ear muffs and gloves ? I am not used to working with them on . 
 OK . I'll go and get a pair of them . 
 Don't mention it . It's been my pleasure . 
 OK . I will . 

Thank you for a lovely day . I really enjoyed it . 
 Thank you for the picnic too . It was supper . 
 Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye . 

Hello , Mr . Smith , Wang Peng speaks . 
 I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner I had yesterday . 
 I'll come back to China tonight . I hope to see you again sometime . 
 I appreciate all help of you during my stay here . 
 Please let me know when you go to China and let me be of some assistance to you . 
 Thanks , good-bye ! 

Mr . Mass , here is a gift for you . 
 It's a souvenir I bought for you from Rome . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did . 
 Never mind . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Oh , it's nothing . 
 Not a bit of it , don't blame yourself . 
 You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . 
 He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . 

I beg your pardon for being late . 
 So sorry , I don't mean to be . 
 Thanks for your forgiving . 
 I'll work hard . 

I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 . 
 Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble . 
 Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ? 
 Please accept my deep apology . 

I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . 
 No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . 
 We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . 
 That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . 
 For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd . 
 My title was Project Manager . There were almost 100 people under my supervision . 
 I'm going to quit the job . 
 The task is tough . 
 Thanks for your concern . 
 I'm not sure . Let's look up the catalogue . 
 I advise that step be taken in power supply first . 
 His suggestion is that the work be started at once . 
 I think so too . 
 Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model . 
 I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .

 Yes , of course . There are many steps . You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . And wail the feedback of the company . 
 You must have over 2 years'experience first . 
 You just need to send an application . 
 Yes . You are expected to know the e-mail address of the company . 
 No , I don't think so . I think the Internet would be better . 
 well , there is no doubt that many people have found jobs through the want ads in the newspaper .

 I am an Assistant Electronics Engineer . 
 I've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since I was little . And my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer . 
 Yes , of course . I am calling to apply for a job as an accountant . 
 Sure . The main courses I took included commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic accounting , and so on . 
 My major is Automobile Designing and I have received my master's degree in science . I think I can do it well . 
 I am a student engineer who mainly took charge of understanding of the mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of various materials . 
 Yes . We are looking for someone who are well-educated and have all-round experience as a manager . 
 Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ? 

What kind of qualities should a secretary have ? 
 I am diligent and hard-working . Besides , I am good at both English and Italian . 

What are your responsibilities as a secretary ? 
 What courses did you take in English secretarial studies ? 

What qualities do you think a senior executive should possess ? 
 Do you have all these qualities ? 

Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation . 
 Bottoms up ! 

Hello , this is Garry Hao . I am calling to inquire the position of English interpreter . 
 I graduated from the Beijing Foreign Studies University . My major is English Translation and Interpretation . 
 Yes , I can . Thank you so much . 
 It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years . While it is difficult , I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession . 
 Yes , a little . I know your school is one of the best known in this town . There are about 200 children in the school . 
 I helped my boss organize some grand ceremonies and maintained close relations with newspapers , magazines , the radio and the TV . 
 If I am not in the service center , I will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints . And pass the criticism on to the relevant department . 
 I taught English in a primary school in Beijing . 
 I am equipped with much experience in teaching for more than 30 years and I also edit teaching materials by myself . 
 I think he should be an expert of everything . 
 Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . 
 Yes , I have the Tour Guide Certificate . 
 Because your travel agency has a good fame in this market ; what's more , all the staff here are working very hard . I like doing some challenging job . 
 Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . 
 Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . 
 All right . I graduated and got the degree of bachelor of economics from Nanjing University 4 years ago . My major is international trade . 
 Of course . Irrevocable letter of credit , confirmed letter of credit , transferable and divisible letter of credit are common terms of payment in international trade . 
 Yes , I have . I was employed by the financial section of the university ever since I graduated . I worked there for 3 years . Then I had worked in a bank for 3 years . 
 Very short time . I became an auditor within three months . 
 Do you know various funds and accounts ? 
 Great . We have a very pleasant working condition and I think we have a fine staff to work with . 
 First of all , as far as I know , your company has had impressive records in business . Second , I want to enter the foreign trade field . 
 I am in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ? 
 What is the salary while on probation ? 
 That sounds fine . 
 Are there paid holidays ? 

All of you have reported your achievements . I'd like to remind you that we must be aware of the threat we face . 
 Yes , we must keep a clear mind with the tough competition . 

I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration . 
 So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper . 
 But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? 
 A new reporter must expect to work many hours . 

First of all , thank you for accepting this job . 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 We ’ ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with , in addition , we offer one percent commission and all your sales . You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance . What ’ s starting salary would you expect here ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Yes , you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year , and you get it additional week after 4 years , and then again , after 9 years if you decide to stay that long , we promote from within based on performance , so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a regional manager . 
 I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field.Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . 
 Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . 
 I expect to work hard , madam . 
 No , I enjoy travelling . 
 We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . 
 That will be good . 
 Good morning , Ms.Wilson . I've got a lot to learn from you . I think I'll enjoy working with you . 
 Thank you . 
 I see.What if the person wanted is out ? 
 Is there anything else I should do ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you . 
 Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . 
 He will be back at about seven o'clock . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . 

Good morning.Wilson Association . 
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . 
 I'm afraid not.He ' s gone for the rest of the day . 
 I don't believe so.He ' s going out of town on business.May I take a message ? 
 Would you care to make another appointment ? 
 I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . 
 Bye-bye . 
 Miss Levin . Nice to meet you . 

I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson . 
 This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ? 

Good morning , sir.Can I help you ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Wang.Do you have an appointment ? 
 I'm afraid Mr.Li is engaged at the moment . Would you mind waiting ? 
 About half an hour . 
 Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead ? 
 Do you want to make another appointment ? 
 Yes , I'll make a note of that and ask Mr.Li to confirm . 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 

Gordon , you're ever so late . 
 But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . 
 How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
 Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? 
 Have you got it now ? 
 When ? 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . 
 This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please . 
 That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? 
 Is there anywhere I can reach him ? 
 I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . 
 Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . 
 Thank you . 

How is the project going ? 
 Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . 
 Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . 
 And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . 
 Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . 
 And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . 
 We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . 
 If you have any problem in your work , let me know . 

Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? 
 What does it say ? 
 I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? 
 But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? 
 OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ? 
 Can we have 7 - day holiday on National Day ? 
 That's great ! 
 Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . 

How was Elvin ? 
 Another note ? But how ? I didn't see anyone ! 
 Uh-oh . He's heating up . What are you going to do now ? 
 You do ? Who ? 
 I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her . 
 Don't worry . I'm patient , but vengeance will be mine . 

We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . 
 If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . 
 You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? 

Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . 
 I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . 
 Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince . 
 OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . 
 Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . 
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
 Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . 
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! 
 No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions . 
 Oh , no one is perfect . 
 We have the equal partnership in team . 
 Thanks for saying that . 
 Thanks , Jane . I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Jane , I appreciate it very much . I expect to see you get nominated pretty soon , too . You've been doing some great work ! 
 Next month . 
 I'm going to manage the whole accounts department . 
 Yes , the company will also give me a prize of 1,000 Yuan . 
 OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat . 
 Of course . Let's go . 
 Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days . 
 Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . 
 So what items must be involved in this report ? 
 Yeah , is that all ? 
 That's too complicated . 
 Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? 
 But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ? 

Good morning . My name's Jason Smith . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , my CV . Yes , here it s . There are three copies . 
 No , I haven't . I'm awfully sorry . Can I send them to you ? 
 I haven't been involved in international business , so I don't have any experiences , but I am diligent and I learn very fast . 
 Yes , in most circumstances.Are you available for business travel ? 
 OK . You are good . Hope to see you next time . I'll call you if you get picked for next test . 

How is your job search 1 going , Janet ? 
 Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! 
 I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . 
 Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . 
 You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . 
 Is that so ? 
 Have you decided ? 
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? 
 OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
 And every best wish for your new job . 

Hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ? 
 They always push the time . How many of them are over fifty ? 
 OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ? 
 I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ? 
 That's possible . At that time , they can choose any activity they like . 
 Let me think ! Pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that . 
 One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? 

Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I right out again first ? 
 Can I print it ? 

I haven't got enough for prosecuting him . 
 I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . 
 Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . 
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? 
 Yes . But why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I used to play football regularly when I was at university . And I used to do athletics in the summer . 
 I was a runner-a long-distance runner . 
 No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 Would you like me to go with you ? 
 Do you want to type that letter ? 
 Do you want to tell her ? 

Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper . 
 What's up ? 
 Thanks for the warning . 

Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 

Please take a seat . 
 Now what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , but first I need some information about you . 
 Well , first of all , your name . What's your surname ? 
 And your other names ? 
 Have you got your e-mail address ? 
 How old are you ? 
 Where were you Bron ? 
 Are you married or single ? 
 And what was your last job ? 

Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale . Please sit down . 
 Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? 
 I see . Well , consulting is a little different . 
 Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ? 
 Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants . 
 Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory . 
 You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours . 
 Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course . 
 Five percent . 
 Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Er , good morning , yes , er ... 
 Oh , yes . Arm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes . Arm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? 
 Really , mmmm . Arm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ? 
 Where exactly have you been working , please ? 
 Yes . I am . Actually my wife is a teacher . 
 German . 
 Since I first met my wife , about three years . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to do that . 
 Thank you . 
 Not too bad , I suppose . 
 Oh , she asked me all sorts of questions . She asked if I smoked , and whether I played sports , she asked me where I went to school , and what subjects I took , and she asked me if I like to meeting people . 
 Well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward . 
 No , but she told me to telephone her next week . 
 Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . 
 He will be back at about seven o'clock . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . 

Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? 
 Did you ? And what did you study ? 
 Would you mind telling me how old you are ? 
 And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? 
 And what was your salary at the bank ? 

Mrcrabby , I ’ m pleased to see you . 
 Oh , yes , I worked there for two years , just graduated from college . 
 It was a good company to work for , I enjoyed my time with them . 
 Yes , I like it very much , the work was not very demanding , and the people I work with were friendly . 
 Because it is an age of challenges , I must accept the new challenge in my life . 
 Hold on a second , please . I'll see if he's in . I'm sorry , Mr.Baker had just gone out . Who's calling ? 
 Yes , certainly . What's that ? 
 OK , I'll have Mr.Baker call you as soon as he comes back . 
 You're welcome . 
 Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? 
 Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? 
 How long do you think she'll be ? 
 Can I leave a message , please ? 
 Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I can . 
 About 100 words a minute . 
 Yes , I can speak Spanish , and I can also speak Chinese . 
 No , I can ’ t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though . 
 Next week ? 
 You mean I have the job ? 

So will you back me up if things get ugly with Elvin ? 
 We just will.Trust me on that . 
 He'll do it . He's too proud not to . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone . 
 Very well , do you know any shorthand ? 
 Can you use the computer or other office machines ? 
 Yes , I see , this is a permanent position . 
 Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time . 

Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by . 
 Yes . 
 I know it . WebTracker is playing for keeps . They'll go for our jugular if we give them the chance . 
 Maybe . Maybe I will . 
 I guess not . 
 Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . 
 What are you trying to say ? 

May I come in , Mr Sun ? 
 Can I try later then ? 
 Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? 

Do you really think we can beat WebTracker ? 
 How can you be so sure ? Do you know something I don't ? 
 What's step two ? 

I want to offer you more invoking stock options . 
 Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . 
 Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . 
 Zina . Look , I know when I hired you , I told you I'd pay you a salary . But I just can't . 
 I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich . 

Please take a seat . 
 Now what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , but first I need some information about you . 
 Well , first of all , your name.What ' s your surname ? 
 And your other names ? 
 Have you got your e-mail address ? 
 How old are you ? 
 Where were you Bron ? 

Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale.Please sit down . 
 Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? 
 I see . Well , consulting is a little different . 
 Umm hmm.Do you have a diver's license ? 
 Fine.We provide a company car for our consultants . 
 Oh yes-five days a week.You have to visit customers all over the territory . 
 You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours . 
 Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course . 
 Five percent . 
 Fine.The next course starts a week from tomorrow . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Sure . I don ’ t mind . 
 I don ’ t see why not . 
 Go ahead . It ’ s OK with me . 
 No . 
 Well . Have you got his permission ? 
 What ’ s your name , please ? 

Good morning . 
 I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . 
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . 
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 
 Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... 

Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? 
 Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? 
 Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . 
 One of the best in the company . 
 Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? 

Good.Now what kind of job do you want ? Mr.Wilson ? 
 Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . 
 Good.Now here's the address of the factory.The manager's name is ... 
 With invoking ? No , thanks . 
 I'm not interested , Zina . 
 I don't think so . 

Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . 
 Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . 
 Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? 
 I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . 
 As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . 
 I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . 
 Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . 

But how did you know I was working for WebTracker ? 
 He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . 
 I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . 

OK , let's find somebody then . 
 Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ? 
 Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you . 
 Don't sweat it . I know just the guy . 
 Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did . 
 That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . 
 I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them . 
 OK . What ? 
 You wouldn't do that . Would you ? 
 What about your accounts ? 
 You do ? How are you going to contact him ? 
 What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ? 
 Can I spy on you guys from the window ? 

Hi , Dave . You're early . 
 I had an idea . 
 I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . 
 My mind is made up . 
 Wow . You are a real snake . 
 I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? 
 I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . 

Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . 
 Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . 
 You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? 
 That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . 
 That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . 
 Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . 

Who has been here already this morning ? 
 They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . 
 Who else has been here ? 
 Elvin ? Which one is he ? 
 I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't . 
 Who told you that ? 

I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... 
 Exactly . 
 How ? 
 But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? 
 Look , we need to have the Stars.com account , right ? 
 And to get it , we have to beat WebTracker to the punch . 
 That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week . 
 Hi , Nacy.Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . 
 yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . 
 That's all right . I'm almost finished.Do you need my help ? 
 Oh . all right I'll read it soon . 
 It's nothing Navy . 
 Mike , you're late again . 
 Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
 Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 
 You'd better . 
 What ? What happened ? 
 Please , give me one more chance . I'll never let it happen again . I'm very sorry . 
 Um , me ? 

I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson . 
 This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ? 

Good morning ! 
 Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged . 
 I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . 
 I really can't say how long she'll be . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . 

Mr.James . I know that office hour is up now , but could you work during the weekend and finish the translations ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry.However , if you could help me out , I'll double the pay for the hours worked . 
 I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then ? 
 Thank you very much , Mr.James . 
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . 
 OK . 
 I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . 
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently.And you don't work well with other employees . 
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . 
 We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . 
 All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . 
 I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today . 
 I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . 
 I'm very sorry . But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . 
 That'll be fine . 
 This is he speaking . 
 Oh , thank you . 
 Yes , it's all right . Shall we say two in the afternoon ? 
 All Right . 
 The hotel is near to People's Square . Its name is Bai Ju Hotel . 
 It's Room 302 on the third floor . But I'll be waiting for you in the lobby , If you can't find me , please page me . 
 See you ! 
 Hi , Mary . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . 
 Right . I ’ ll see you later . 

Welcome to our company . 
 An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . 
 She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . 
 He is our accountant . 
 Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . 
 What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? 
 In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . 
 Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . 
 Come in , please . 
 In 3 months or so . 
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times.and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . 
 I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . 

To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ? 
 Do you have any questions about the job ? 
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . 

Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . 
 Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . 
 The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . 
 Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . 
 I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . 
 I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . 
 Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . 
 Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . 
 I think I would like that . 
 Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , but why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I'd delighted if you did . 
 Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . 
 Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . 
 Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
 I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . 
 Sure thing . 
 No problem . 
 Nice to meet you , Austin . 
 By the way , Richard will assist me in the planning work . I hope you can work well together . 
 Thank you.It ' s very kind of you . 
 Thank you , sir . I'll try my best to assist Richard in his work . 
 I used to work as a mechanic and I was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles . 
 I worked in Hanson Paper Company . 
 Because the company is far away from home , and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday . 
 Good morning.Mr.Green.My name is Helen.What can I do for you ? 
 Yes.Are you interested in the job ? 
 Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ? 
 Good.There are many different kind of language labs , but ours is a small one.If you decide to take the job , I'll explain how to operate the system , Are you sure ? 
 Ten hours a week.From Monday to Friday , from 4 to 6 P . m . , and $ 150 a week . 
 Fine.Please fill out the application form . 
 Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? 
 That ’ s fine . Thanks for coming to see us . I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week . 
 Really ! I've never seen so much work . 
 I don't know . I have no idea . 
 I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible . 
 OK , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Thanks.This is fun ! 
 No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before.Maybe I should learn to do something . 
 Do you really think I can be a good player ? 
 Yes . This has been fun . 
 I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors . 
 I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation . 
 My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . 
 I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience . 
 I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position . 

Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ? 
 How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? 
 Oh , yes.How old are you ? 
 Hum , still a student ? 
 What subjects are you studying ? 
 Have you had any working experience . 
 What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 How are your English and computer skills ? 
 Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . 
 How do you do , Mr . Smith ? My name is Thou Hong . 
 Will you please take a seat ? Mr . Smith , have you seen the display of our electronic products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? 
 Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . 
 Good . We can hold more talks later on to iron out the details . 

I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
 Yes , I want to get a better job . 
 I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . 
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . 

Good afternoon , Mr . Yang . I'm Jill , Mr . Smith's secretary . Would you like to look around the factory first ? 
 Now this is our office block . We have all the administrative departments Sales , Accounting , Personnel , Market Research and so on . 
 That's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored . We keep a stock of the fast-moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . ( in the workshop ) This is one of our three workshops . This is the delivery bay here . 
 The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result . 
 I'll take you to the assembly shop ... 
 Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . 
 Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . 
 All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? 
 I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . 
 Your achievement is obvious to all . 
 Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company . 
 If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . 
 I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? 
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . 

Mr . Smith . could you give me your quotation for your bicycle A5 , FOB Qingdao ? 
 100 for immediate delivery , and 500 in two months time.that ' s by the end of July 
 Since this is a sizeable order , I was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount . 
 Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products . 
 I think I can accept that . 
 You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here . 
 I'm particularly interested in shortbreads . Do you have some samples you could show me ? 
 The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . I wonder if Your pastry tastes better . 
 Oh , it's delicious ... 
 We mostly handle office furniture . We supply first-class furniture . Here are our catalogue and the pattern books . You can see the material is superior and with all the latest styles . Can you give me some idea about what you're looking for ? 
 The price varies somewhat according to the size of your order . Would you tell us the quantity you want so that we can work out an offer ? 
 It's our pleasure to do business with you . We'll let you have the offer next Wednesday at the latest . 

How was your appraisal with the boss ? 
 Yes , I think he ’ s the most relaxed person in management . 
 That ’ s good . Maybe you ’ ll get promoted . 

It is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties . 
 I hope that we can continue our cooperation . 
 Thank you for your consideration . We will inform you of our intention as soon as possible . 

We wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes . 
 Please inform us of your decision as soon as possible . 
 Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation . 

We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
 We look forward to your settlement at an early date . 

We are sorry to bring you so much trouble . 
 Yes . That's what we want . 
 I do hope this undesirable incident will not stand in the way of our future business . 

I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . 
 We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .

 Glad to meet you . 
 Well , I'm not too happy about it . 
 Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again . 

May I take the liberty to introduce myself to you ? My name is Dick Brown . I am the sales manager of our company . 
 How do you do ?

 Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time . 

Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . 
 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 
 No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . 
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . 
 No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . 

Where are you from ? 
 So you speak German , don't you ? 
 Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? 
 Good .

 Really ? Why ? 
 But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . 
 Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? 
 Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . 
 Sure . 
 Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ? 
 I see . What is today's schedule ? 
 OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts . 
 Yes . I am going to show them some slides in the meeting . Can you call Mr . Brown to remind him of the dinner this evening ? 
 That would be great ! You are really a good employee . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 It's our pleasure . 

Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ? 
 Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ? 
 That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?

 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think . 

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? 
 Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . 
 Where do you see yourself five years from now ? 

Could you do something to advance your shipment ? 
 We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . 

What's combined transportation ? 
 Why is it necessary ? 

We'd better have a brief talk about the loading port .

When do you plan to deliver the goods ? 
 Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment . 

May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ?

May I know the definite date of delivery ? 
 Is there any possibility for you to ensure prompt shipment ? 

What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 
 That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . 
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . 
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
 When will the branch office open ? 
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? 
 I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . 
 Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing it ’ s the most important thing to me . 
 Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . 
 Yes , of course . 
 In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . 
 By doing whatever is necessary . 
 What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? 
 In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . 
 Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . 
 I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . 
 Because I ’ m very competent in this area . 
 Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . 
 I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . 
 I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? 
 Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . 
 You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? 
 You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . 

A :: You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . 
 A :: Tim , please . Please be seated . 
 A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ? 

OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . 
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! 
 OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . 
 Thank you , that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! 
 Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . 
 There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . 

How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? 
 I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . 
 He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . 
 I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . 
 It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . 
 I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . 

You look very professional in the suit . 
 I appreciate it . It is related to company image . 
 Here you are . Do you need glue ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . 
 To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . 

How do I submit an expense report ? 
 You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? 

Let ’ s call it a day . 
 It ’ s hard to commute a long way . 

Are you familiar with the office management ? 
 Are you still interested in it ? 

Did you sign up for the picnic party ? 
 This time you can bring your daughter with you . 
 There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . 
 Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college . 
 I worked as a PR clerk for one year 
 I used to hold a similar job for six years . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , I need a job that can give full play to my skills . 
 I like peace.As a matter of fact , I once had a job in a library . 
 Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? 
 Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? 
 I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . 
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . 
 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . 
 I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 
 I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . 
 Thank you , I will be doing my best . 
 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . 
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . 

You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work . 
 Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . 

Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? 
 I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . 
 Yes , I will need it . Thanks . 
 Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . 
 That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . 
 Sure , just send me through internal mail . 
 No problem at all . Welcome . 
 I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . 
 Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . 
 Not for me . It is already late . I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late . 
 I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . 
 It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . 
 Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . 
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 
 Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 

Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? 
 I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . 

Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . 
 Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . 

Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . 
 Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . 
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . 

What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
 Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . 
 Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . 
 Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . 

Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? 
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 
 James is going to be packed off there . 

The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . 
 Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . 
 Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . 
 Well , I will try . 
 If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . 
 Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . 

Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . 
 Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . 
 I doubt that . 
 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 Have you thought about it seriously ? 
 Ok , did you find a new company ? 
 Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . 

What is the most enjoyable part about your job ? 
 What do you find annoying ? 

Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? 
 Ok . 
 It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen PM . Do you have a projector in your room ? I would like to show you some related charts 

Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? 
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . 
 Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . 
 Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . 
 Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . 

You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . 
 Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . 
 Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . 
 I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . 
 It's just the job I've been searching for . 
 Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . 
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . 
 Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . 
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . 
 That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . 

Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
 You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . 
 The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 

Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . 
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? 
 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . 

Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? 
 Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . 
 A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . 
 Neither , I prefer an active job . 
 That's better . I like travelling . 
 I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . 
 Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . 
 That ’ s the way to go . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . 
 Then keep up the good work . 
 Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 OK . 
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . 
 Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . 
 How did I do ? 
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . 

I'm really in a flap about the interview . 
 I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes . 

Hi , are you busy ? 
 Okay , I'm putting together a report on the Allied Marketing Co . failure , and I seem to have run into a stone wall . Can you help me out ? 
 You were there when the problem started . I was hoping you could fill me in on the details . 
 Name it . 
 All right , I can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem . 
 Give me the study . I'll start as soon as I get back to my office . 

Well , that's why you'r here.My source for big TV sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so I need someone new . I wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . I think 
 Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? 
 Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? 
 Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? 
 Well , I know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . I'm your client , not your company.As your client , I expect you to be square with me at all times . Can you do that ? 
 Good ! Do you have any questions ? 
 The question is we only need one . 
 I should take the taller one for the choice . 
 Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 So this is a real thing ? 
 When do you need it ? 
 Sure , who am I bidding against ? 
 Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then . 
 Is this about the Sales Assistant position ? 
 Mr wilson is on the line right now . Please have a seat . He'll be right with you . 
 Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? 

Mr . Johnson , there's something I'd like to talk over with you . Would sometime this week be convenient for you ? 
 That'll be fine . 

So , John , what do you do for a living ? 
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? 
 Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? 

I'd like to make an appointment with Dr.Cooper.Could you arrange it for me ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting from nine to ten.What about Monday afternoon ? 

Excuse me , Dr.Steward , I wonder if I could talk with you about my paper . 
 Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ? 

I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
 How about next week ? 

Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time . 
 It's a shame.Will this afternoon be all right ? But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . 

Hello , this is Dr Cook's clinic.May I speak to Mr.Smith ? 
 Dr Cook won't be able to see you at the time suggested.Could you make it a quarter to two ? 

I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to . 
 Anytime except today.Please give him a call before you come . 

I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . 
 If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? 

I was really glad to hear about your award , congratulations ! 
 You ’ Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . You definitely deserve it . 

I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m . 
 Sorry , the whole afternoon is filled up here.Will tomorrow do ? 

Are you OK there ? 
 Can I help ? 
 Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . 
 I'll look out for you about 2 tomorrow afternoon . 

Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ? 
 Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? 
 Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday ! 

Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? 
 Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . 
 Why don't you take a few days off ? 

Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Who should I say is calling ? 
 And what is it regarding please ? 
 Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . 
 Good afternoon , I'm looking for Mr . Alert Li . 
 Sure . This is Nigel Smith his personal banker . Could you ask him to return my call ? 
 It's 2781703 1 . 
 Thanks so much , bye . 
 I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . 
 Not very long from the looks of it ! 
 He's dancing with Jack ! 
 The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . 
 You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... 
 How embarrassing ! 
 Couldn't he wait until we're finished eating ? 
 Can you even hear what he's saying ? 
 Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . 

Can I help you ? 
 Chang ? 
 There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ? 
 Eric Chang in accounting ? 
 I'll call him and tell him you're here . 
 Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ? 
 OK . I'll have him come up to get you . 
 Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . 
 It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? 
 The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . 
 Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei ! 
 Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with ! 

Our supervisor Lester does . Actually , Lester is kind of like the kitchen god . 
 He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! 
 Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . 
 I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! 
 And what happened ? 

See how many people are here ! 
 Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . 
 Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . 
 Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! 
 Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . 
 I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! 

Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith . 
 Do you know when he will be back ? 
 Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? 
 Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? 
 Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ? 
 Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . 

OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! 
 Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! 
 So , what did you win ? 
 A bar of soap ! 
 Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . 
 We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! 
 ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . 
 Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . 
 Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... 
 Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? 
 That's great ... 
 Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . 
 Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . 

Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . 
 Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? 
 And this is your company's head office ? 
 That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? 
 That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? 

These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? 
 What is our time frame ? 

Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? 
 I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . 
 It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . 
 Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! 
 What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? 
 Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... 
 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . 
 Good , as long as you understand that . 
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . 

Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? 
 Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . 
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that sound ? 
 The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . 
 Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . 
 Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . 
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? 
 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . 

Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 

Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? 
 Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
 What ! I resent that ! 

And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . 
 Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . 
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . 
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . 

Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . 
 Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? 
 Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? 
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... 
 Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! 
 Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? 
 You wanna take some time off , is that right ? 
 What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . 
 Well , I guess so . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . 
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . 
 I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . 

Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ? 
 Certainly , what day were you thinking of ? 
 Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ? 
 Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? 
 Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that . 
 Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! 
 Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . 
 Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! 

I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
 Yes , I want to get a better job . 
 I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . 
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . 

Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? 

John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . 
 No . Come here right now . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Why ? I work very hard . 
 Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . 
 It's unfair . 
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . 

How do you like your job here , Linda ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . 
 Do you have any complaints ? 
 Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . 

I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! 
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
 I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 

If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . 
 Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . 

May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I'm quiting . 
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . 
 Very well , consider me gone . 
 That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? 
 That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? 
 Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . 
 Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 

You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? 
 I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . 
 You know the phrase the survival of the fittest . We have no choices . 

How do you do ? 
 My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ? 
 You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . 
 Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . 

Hi , my name is Tom . 
 Nice to meet you too.Melinda . 
 Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . 
 It looks like you guys work hard . 
 Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 

Do you have a moment ? 
 I'm having some trouble . I don't know how to use this printer . I've never seen this kind of office printer before . Is it a new brand ? 
 Silly me ! 
 Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? 
 Which one is this ? 

Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager . 
 I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese . 
 It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . 
 I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , “ A great oak needs deep roots . ” I ’ m really interested in this job . 

Welcome to our company . 
 An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . 
 She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . 
 He is our accountant . 
 Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . 
 First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record . Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business . 
 I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Yes . Are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ? 
 That would be good . 
 OK , please be seated . May I have your name , please ?

 All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . 
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world , and this seemed like a good first step . 
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . 
 Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . 
 Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . 
 Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen . 
 Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . 
 Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . 

Why do you want to be a stewardess ?

Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ? 
 Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years . 
 I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first . 
 I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade . 
 Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir ! 
 Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company ! 
 Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ?

 Ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? 
 Some next week on , we should be in less of a rush . 
 Don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . 
 Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . 
 They usually go on for ages . 
 I will . Enjoy your meeting ! 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . 
 No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . 
 Yes . That's true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . 

How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . 
 We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . 
 We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . 
 Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign . 
 Ok . I understand that we basically work from 8 thirty to 5 thirty with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? 
 That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? 
 How often do you have meetings ? 
 I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . 
 I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . 
 That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? 

Could you tell me your education background ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What degree did you get ? 
 What was your major ?

 I see . 
 Great . Are you a qualified teacher ? 
 What kind of teaching certificate do you have ? 
 How many years of experience do you have ? 
 When did you get your TEFL certificate ? 
 Why do you want to teach at our school ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ? 
 Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10 ? 
 Great . See you then . 
 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . 
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so they get special prices . 
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and requirements . 
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client . 
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . 
 That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . 
 I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . I ’ d like to help people invest their money . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations . 
 Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? 
 Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well . 

We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? 
 See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . 
 The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . 
 We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward suggestions and ideas . Be sure to speak up if you have any . 
 Sure , what do you want me to tell them ? 
 Ok , where can I find their telephone number ? 
 Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ? 
 Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? 
 Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? 
 And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? 
 Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? 
 Did you leave a voice message ? 
 I see . What did you tell her ? 
 Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . 
 One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? 
 Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 See you . 
 Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 How old is he ? 
 Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? 

Hi , Deny . Are still working ? 
 So , you are leaving , aren't you ? 
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? 
 Excuse me for taking your time . 

Excuse me sir . May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I 
 But it's true . 
 That's coincident 。 
 I promise I will . 

We have the orientation this afternoon . 
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . 
 Yes , it is not easy . 

Mr . Bryant ? Hi , I'm Mike from Florence Incorporated . I'll glad you made it okay . How was your flight ? 
 That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired . 
 Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it . 
 I've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . Then , I'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . I've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . Afterwards , I've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . Seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting . How does that schedule sound to you ? 

Hello , Mr.Benson , welcome to Beijing ! Is this your first time to visit china ? 
 Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ? 
 I can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it ! 
 Don't worry , I would be able to go along with you , over the next few days , if you have any questions or problems , I will be right here to help you out , I can be a translator and tour guide . 
 My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! 
 Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . 
 Didn't you get the memo ? 
 The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . 
 It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? 
 That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos . 
 Yes , sir ... 
 Yes , sir.Go ahead . 
 Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? 
 But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . 
 This applies to internal and external communications . 
 Is that all ? 

Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . 
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . 
 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . 
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? 
 Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 
 Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? 
 Can I leave a message for him please ? 
 My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? I have a rather timely matter to discuss with him . 
 Yes , please let him know I would like to discuss the Girard case with him . 
 I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . 
 He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . 
 Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda 
 I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? 
 Yes , there is . See you then . 
 To visit our supplier ? 
 Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . 
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? 
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . 
 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . 
 Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ? 
 No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information . 
 The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week . 
 Er ? I am driving right now . Can you call back in 30 minutes ? 
 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . 
 Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now . 

... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? 

Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office . 
 Ok , see you then , bye . 

So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... 
 That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . 
 Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 . 
 Sure , just send me through internal mail . 
 No problem at all . Welcome . 
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . 
 No problem . Good luck . 

Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . 
 I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . 

I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . 
 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 What is the problem ? 
 It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . 

Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . 
 Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . 

My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? 
 How ? 
 Very useful advice , I will try them right now . 
 I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . 
 Thank you , I will be doing my best . 
 Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . 
 I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . 
 Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . 

Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . 
 I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? 
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 

Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ? 
 Sorry , he is out . 
 Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ? 
 That ’ s fine . Please call again later . 

When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? 
 Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . 
 I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . 
 I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . 
 Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . 

We did a survey on your job performance . 
 Not so good . Lots of complains . 
 Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . 
 That ’ ll be most helpful . 
 How much do you spend on development every year ? 
 What ’ s that building opposite us ? 
 If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? 

How do you think the report I wrote ? 
 I jumped the gun . 
 Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . 
 It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . Brown . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? 
 Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers ? 
 Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . 
 As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . 
 That ’ s something we can discuss later . 
 You need all your receipts for reimbursement . 
 Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . 
 Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . 
 I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . 
 It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? 
 Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? 
 Is there probation ? 

Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? 
 I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . 

Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . 
 That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . 

With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? 
 Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . 
 In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . 
 I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . 
 I propose we accept the minutes . 
 I second . 
 I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . 
 If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . 
 Go ahead , please . 
 You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . 
 We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . 
 You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . 
 We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . 
 Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . 
 Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . 
 Do you think it's that serious ? 
 My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . 
 This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . 
 Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . 
 Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . 
 Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . 
 It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . 
 We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . 
 It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . 
 Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . 
 No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . 
 It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . 

Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? 
 What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? 

The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . 
 Why is the price so high ? 
 Model of computers aren't compatible ? 
 Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . 
 True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . 
 This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . 

Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
 From eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
 Sometimes , but not quite often . 
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! 
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . 
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 

Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . 
 Thank you . 
 Should each of us write separately ? 

May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 
 Thank you for telling me that . 
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . 
 I got it . 
 I see 
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? 
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . 
 Have a seat please while I call . 
 He is at the warehouse this morning . 
 Sorry , I have no idea . You can call him there if you like . 

Is Mr . Thomas there , please ? 
 I said , is Mr . Thomas there ? 

Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . 
 Coffee would be fine . 
 I like it black . 

Hello . 
 Not really , I ’ m in a meeting . Can I call you back in ... say ... 15 minutes ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll look out for it . Sorry , I can ’ t talk now . 
 Unfortunately , he has left for the day . 
 I ’ ll make sure he gets the message . 
 I ’ m Liu Yi . I ’ d like to speak to Mr . Smith . 
 I ’ d like to speak with Mr . Robert Smith . 

We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . 
 Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? 
 Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 

Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . 
 I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . 
 Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? 
 How do you work with a team ? 
 What ’ s your long term goal ? 

I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 

I've got some great news for you ! 
 Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . 
 Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... 
 You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . 
 Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . 

What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 

Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . 
 I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . 
 That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . 

Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 

I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . 
 Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . 
 Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . 
 What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
 Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . 
 Yes , Sir . 
 All right , who should I send them to ? 
 Ok , home or office address ? 
 Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 

Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 

Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
 What are they ? 
 And what is the most important point ? 

Hello , this is Francis . 
 Today , I am busy all day long . 
 That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . 
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . 
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
 Other company rules also need your attention . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? 
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? 
 It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? 
 I got it . Thank you so much . 

Good afternoon . How can I help you ? 
 Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . 
 Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . 
 Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . 
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 
 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 

The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . 
 According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . 
 No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . 
 Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? 
 Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 You mean the network connection ? 
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 

What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? 
 You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? 

How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
 Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . 

Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . 
 We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . 
 Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? 
 I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . 
 From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . 
 here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... 
 We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . 

How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? 
 Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . 
 Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? 
 So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? 
 Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? 

How did your company's fundraiser go ? 
 So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? 
 Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . 

John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . 
 John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . 
 Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . 
 You've earned it . 
 We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . 
 It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . 
 For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . 
 Hello , Lucy . 
 Yes , I have decided to work with your company . 
 It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . 
 No problem . Thank you for calling me . 

Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . 
 In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . 
 It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . 
 Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? 
 Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? 
 Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? 

Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . 
 Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . 
 Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? 
 So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? 

How often are stockholders meetings held ? 
 What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... 
 So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? 

Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow . 
 Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . 
 No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training . 
 No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . 
 Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . 
 Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . 
 He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . 
 The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . 
 He just has his secretary do his homework for him . 
 Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . 
 Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . 
 Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . 
 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . 
 Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . 
 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . 
 Mr . White , too . 
 Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . 
 Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . 
 You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help . 
 Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . 
 I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . 
 I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . 
 I would rather work full-time . 
 I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . 
 It is 15 minutes ’ drive . 
 Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations . 
 Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . 
 Yes , at the end of the hall . 
 Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . 
 What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? 
 Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? 

We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? 
 No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? 
 Are you kidding ? 

Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . 
 Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? 
 Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... 
 Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . 
 Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . 
 Sure . 
 That would be very nice . Thank you . 

It is really exciting news . 
 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . 
 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . 

How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . 
 Ok . 
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . 
 Certainly , work always comes first . 
 Well , keep a low profile . 
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 
 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 

Did you hear something ? 
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . 
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . 

Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 

What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 

A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? 
 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . 
 Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . 

You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 
 That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . 
 But if the company asks , what else can we do ? 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . 
 Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . 
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? 
 Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . 
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? 
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . 
 Have a seat please while I call . 
 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . 
 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
 How regular ? 
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . 
 That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . 
 You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . 

Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
 Totally agree . What is your solution ? 
 You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . 
 But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . 

I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . 
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 
 Sure . 
 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . 
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? 
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . 

Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . 
 Really ? What could that be ? 
 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 
 It was a nightmare . 
 Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . 
 Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . 
 I am still waiting for their call . 

Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . 
 I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . 
 Sure , here it is ... 
 Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? 
 I don't think so , why do you ask ? 
 Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . 
 Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . 
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it . 
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
 Other company rules also need your attention . 
 Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Sure , what I can do for you ? 
 You can just put Dear Sir or Madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned . 
 Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . 
 Right , do you need them to respond ? 
 You can tell them " Please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say Attach a customer survey . If you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience . 
 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! 
 What was so bad about it ? 
 Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . 

Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
 From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
 Sometimes , but not quite often . 
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . 
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . 
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . 

We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you . 
 That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . 
 It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . 
 Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... 
 We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . 
 OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? 
 OK , will do . 
 Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . 
 What about that one ? 
 You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . 
 I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . 
 Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time . 
 It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A . 
 Yes . 
 No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms.Jenkins , Please . 
 This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday . 
 No problem . 

Excuse me , Don ? I hate to bother you , but I need your help on something . Do you have time to brief me on the Martin account today ? 
 I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ... 
 How about this ... We can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and I'll order some Chinese food for delivery . It'll be my treat . 
 I insist . I really appreciate you taking time to work with me in . What is your favorite fast food ? I'll cater to your taste . 
 Great . I'll bring the food . 
 Hello , is Doris available ? 
 Hi , Doris , this is Mike calling from Parker's Dentistry . I'm calling to confirm your appointment for tomorrow morning at 9 am with Dr.Parker . 
 If I put you in at a later spot , would that work out ? 
 Sorry ma'm , the only opening we have after lunch is one fifteen , but I might be able to work you in after 4 . would that be a better time ? 
 No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen . 

Hello , this is Francis . 
 Today , I am busy all day long . 
 That ’ s not good for me at all . It ’ ll have to be another time . 
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
 To encourage the staff increases . 
 What about the afternoon ? 

Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? 
 These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . 
 It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . 
 Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . 
 Yes , it ’ s right . 
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 Yes , it will print immediately . 
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
 They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
 You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule . 
 What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
 Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . 
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . 
 Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . 
 Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ? 
 Do you mean all the sales letters from them ? 
 I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ? 
 No problem . 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ? 
 Oh . If you had talked to me first , we would have given you a raise . 
 Ok , good luck , Jessica . By the way , if you ever need a letter of recommendation , I would be happy to write one for you . 
 I am.What can I do for you ? 
 Very good , you majored in International Trade ? 
 Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year . 
 Good.That is the kind of man we are looking for.By the way , do you like traveling ? Our sales representatives need to travel a lot . 
 Are you willing to work for extra hours ? 
 What about next Monday ? 
 Well , see you next monday . 
 Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . 
 Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . 
 I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . 
 Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . 
 When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . 
 No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . 
 Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? 
 Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . 
 You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? 
 I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? 
 Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . 
 Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? 
 But I am not familiar with the members of the board . 
 That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . 
 OK , but I think you should keep an eye on your plan if you see what I mean . 
 No buts . The thing is to cut down your expense , Judie . 
 I ’ m sure I can do it well . I ’ Ve always wanted to be the best in whatever I did . Give me a chance . 
 You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . 
 You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! 
 I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? 
 Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? 
 Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . 

Hello , can I speak to Mark Wyatt , please ? 
 Does Mark Wyatt work there ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Mark Wyatt . 
 No problem . 
 Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal .

 Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday.Can she do Tuesday ?

Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ?

OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . 
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! 
 OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . 
 Thank you.that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! 
 I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . 
 Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . 
 There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . 
 I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . 
 My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . 
 I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . 
 My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . 
 First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . 
 Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? 
 I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . 
 I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . 
 My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful . 
 Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . 
 Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . 
 Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . 
 To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . 
 I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . 
 Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . 
 My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting . 
 There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker . 
 Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person . 
 Cheerfulness and friendliness . 
 They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person . 
 I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going . 
 I get on well with others . 
 What happened ? 
 Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 Uh-huh . 

Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . 
 Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . 
 Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? 
 Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
 I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 

I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! 
 Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . 
 Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . 
 That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! 
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . 
 I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . 
 It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ? 
 Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons . 
 Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . 
 Yeah I got a club card . Here you go . 
 Debit please . Also , could I get cash back ? Fifty dollars would be great . 

And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . 
 Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . 
 I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! 
 I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English Test Band 4 and 6.My spoken English is fairly good enough to express myself fluently . 
 I did self-study of Japanese in college , and I can carry on some simple conversations in Japanese . 
 Because the job I am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but I like challenge.Your firm is a young organisation with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . 
 I have excellent communication skills and I am familiar with the procedures for the last company I worked for . Besides , I am a team player and have great interpersonal skills . 
 I am attending Hebes University of Technology . 
 This coming July . 
 I will receive a Bachelor's degree . 
 My major is Business Administration . 
 I have been doing quite well at college . According to the academic records I've achieved so far , I am confident that I will get my Bachelor of Business Administration this coming July . 
 I have already learned a lot in the classroom and I hope to be able to make practical use of it in your company . My specialization at the university is just in line with the areas your institute deals with . I am sure I can apply what I have learned to the work in your institute . 
 I graduated from Hebes University . 
 I majored in Economics . 
 I take more than 50 courses in university , including microeconomics , macroeconomics , marketing principles , sales management , statistics , and so on . 
 I did well in university . I was one of the top students in the class . 
 I didn't minor in any subject when I was in university , but I attended English and computer courses . And I am currently studying finance in a training school . 
 Please , call me Ted . 
 That ’ s no problem . 
 Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? 
 I see . 
 Sounds fine . 
 Yes . In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University , and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University . 
 In fact my records were excellent . My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale , which was the highest in my class . 
 English . It was both interesting and useful , so I showed a great interest in it . 
 Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it . I also performed well in the subjects . Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position . 
 Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize . 
 I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . 
 I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . 
 My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful . 
 Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . 
 Yes , I have received an Engineer's Qualification Certificate and a driver's license . 
 I have two years driving experience . 
 I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . 
 Visual C + + , C and Delphi . 
 No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . 
 You are welcome . Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . 
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 2974-5328 , and you can call me at any time in the daytime . 
 Great . I will look forward to hearing from you . And do I need the second interview ? 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , I'd like to know if there would be any future opportunities for specific training . 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 I can be reached at my office during work hours and at home in the evening . My office phone number and home phone number are in my resume . 
 Thank you , sir . I expect to hear from you as soon as possible . 
 All right . Goodbye . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mrs Smith ? 
 This is Sun , and I interviewed with you yesterday . 
 I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday . 
 I really enjoyed meeting with you . 
 I am very interested in this position . 
 Well , thank you for your time and consideration again . 

Anything else ? 
 Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . 
 You get five paid sick days . 
 Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . 
 We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . 
 This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ? 
 You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability . 
 No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again . 
 Ok , I will . Do you have any question ? 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it . 
 No . 
 Thank you for the calling . Bye-bye . 
 No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
 What was that like ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did you get any perks on the job ? 

Have you found a new job yet ? 
 What kind of work ? 
 What do you do there ? 
 How long is the assignment ? 

Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . 
 Well , why should we hire you ? 
 Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? 
 Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO . 

Good morning , my name is Martin . You've applied for the Laboratory Assistant's position , right ?

Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . 
 Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? 
 Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way . 
 I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . 
 Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . 
 Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . 
 Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . 

Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . 
 So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . 
 Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? 
 Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . 
 Interesting ... 

So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . 
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . 
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! 
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . 
 Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . 
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . 
 I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . 

Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . 
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . 
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . 
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? 

Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 How are your typing and shorthand skills ? 
 Can you operate computers skillfully ? 
 Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ? 
 It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual . 
 OK , please . 
 Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence . 
 We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ? 

What made you decide on this type of occupation ? 
 Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? 
 Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? 
 Are you in good health ? 
 Have you had any nursing experience ? 
 How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? 
 What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? 

Is Betty Sue in her office ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . 
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? 

Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant . 
 I graduated from Tianjin College of Commerce . 
 My major was accounting . 
 Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises . 
 I'm engaged in accounting . 
 My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency . 
 I think so . 
 Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . 
 The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities . 
 Good morning , Mrs Smith . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . 
 No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . 
 I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . 
 No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . 
 I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company . 
 No , can you tell me about it ? 
 I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ? 
 Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member . 
 It's always been my dream to be a stewardess . And I like travelling to different places . 
 Well , a stewardess should be friendly , courteous , patient and treat passengers kindly and politely . 
 No , I know how to control my temper . 
 I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time . 
 I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works . 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Well , first you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I ’ ll go get some . 
 I have been a Production Manager . 
 3 years . 
 I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . 
 Frankly speaking , three . If your company employs me , it will be my fourth . 
 Yes . I was awarded the title of Advanced Worker last year . 
 Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances . 
 They would say I am a responsible friend and a capable colleague . 
 Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are . 
 I think that you have covered all the important points already.But if I have any questions later I will contact you . 
 Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . 
 I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
 It's the most important thing to me . 
 That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . 
 I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . 
 I haven't thought it over at all . 
 I think the most important thing is the interest in the job . 
 Yes . After my graduation from university , I worked as a Customer Service Coordinator in a foreign representative office , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a Market Development Manager . So I am familiar with the market in China . 
 I learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . 
 No , I haven't discussed my leaving plans with my current employer , but I am sure he will release me . 
 Very good . 
 They would say I'm a dependable and hard worker . 
 As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future . 
 By doing everything necessary and for further study . 
 How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other . 
 I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time . 
 My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year . 
 I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year . 
 I think you'll find I'm worth that . 
 Yes , it is quite reasonable . 
 To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me . 
 I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues . 
 I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company 
 I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job . Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first ? 
 I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary . 

What's your expected salary ? 
 How do you feel about an annual salary of 100,000 Yuan plus bonus . 
 That sounds very reasonable . 
 Generally it is 6 months and during this period you are half-paid . 
 What is it ? 
 Let ’ s see ... “ Wanted

 Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ?

Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office . 
 I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me . 
 I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion . 
 Yes , Mr . Hammer . 
 Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design . 
 I have worked on about every system that is out right now . 
 I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems . But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time . 
 I am knowledgeable and levelheaded . 
 Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ? 
 Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . 
 Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . 
 But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . 

How do I set up an email account ? 
 Which link ? 
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It ’ s asking me for a password . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , I see . 

John , do you have a minute ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . 
 That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . 
 No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . 
 No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . 
 Oh , that would be too small . 
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . 

I ’ d like to ask whether it is correct to partake in the firm ’ s insurance plan ? 
 But people keep talking about the benefits from the plan . 
 I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . 
 I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . 
 Yes , of course . 
 And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . 
 So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . 
 I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? 
 I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . 
 Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . 

Can you help me do an internet search ? 
 I want to find information on the American Civil War . 
 Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg . 
 Oh wow , there are a lot of sites . 
 Thanks . 
 Thanks . If I ’ m interested , I ’ ll go to the library . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Hold on a minute please . I ’ ll have my assistant check that part . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 I'm not sure if that would be wise . 
 Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say . 
 Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ? 
 All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . 
 Sure , what is it ? 
 I'm sorry . I've been having some problems . 
 I got laid off today . 
 Yeah . 
 My boss said I didn ’ t have enough skills to do the job well . 
 I ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position . 
 I would if I could . 
 Because I have other obligations . 
 For What ? 
 Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . This is Mary . Is Jenny there ?

I see by your resume that you have been working ? 
 Tell me what you know about our company , please . 
 What do you know about our major products and our share of the market ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Do you like this job ? 
 What do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ? 
 I agree with you . Do you have any questions to ask about this job ? 
 I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan . But the specific number will be determined according to your sales . 
 We cannot reach a final decision until we have talked to all of the other five applicants . Anyhow , we'll contact you within this month . All right . Nice meeting you . Good-bye . 

Tell me something about yourself and your past . 
 What was the most significant project you've worked on ? 
 What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ? 
 How would your coworkers evaluate you ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 

Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? 
 Why did you leave your last position ? 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 How would your boss describe you and your work style ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 

Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson . 
 I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies . 
 I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation . 
 I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration . 
 The courses I completed are marketing , business law , business English , statistics , marketing principles , sales management , distribution theory , economies and psychology . 
 I liked sales strategies most . 
 It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . 
 I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing . 
 Yes , a little . As you mentioned just now , yours is an American capital company . As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products . 
 Will traveling be required in this position ? 
 How often ? 
 That's fine . 
 I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd . 
 I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience . 
 I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position . 
 I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis . 
 I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . 
 I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself . 
 After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team . 
 Immediately . 
 I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry . For the past two years , I have been working as a project manager for a dotcom . I am also MI certified . I'm looking for a team environment where I can join the excitement of building a company . 
 I have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry . I wanted to have the experience of working for a dotcom and have learned something about being in on the ground floor of a business . 
 I've been searching for a while now to find a company that had a business model and corporate philosophy like yours . I am interested in working for a company that provides products and services to the K - 12 education market . My background is in this field , and my strength is in building relationships and solving problems . I am excited and interested in the idea of developing business relationships through e-commerce . 
 To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented . My past record shows that I have those qualities and more . Because of my business acumen and technical know-how , the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results , including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue . 
 When I have a specific project to complete , I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end . I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time . 
 I've set some goals for myself and my career , and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation . I have begun to explore options available before I spend too much time in a job where I can't advance . My goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . 
 Yes , I do . Who are your financial backers ? Who are the key competitors ? Does the company have a plan for the IPO ? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . 
 Sure , but this week is crazy for me . Can we make it next Monday ? 
 That's fine . See you then . 
 Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . 
 But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . 
 Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . 
 A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . 
 Hard but interesting , I think . 
 Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . 
 Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . 
 Good afternoon , Mrs Smith . 
 Thank you . Yes , I am Dunlin . 
 Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering . The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines . 
 I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed . 
 Your company has a very good reputation , and I am very interested in the field your company is in . 
 Interpersonal and technical skills . 
 I have the abilities , qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert , for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president . 
 After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department . 
 Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ? 
 That's fine . 
 No . 
 Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . 
 I have four years study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . Moreover , I have worked at CAB Company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience . 
 I am a senior mechanical design engineer . 
 Yes . Here it is . 
 Of course , I designed a more powerful gasoline engine , which greatly increased the speed of limousines . 
 I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work . 
 I care about people and I know the importance of insurance . 
 Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd . 
 Yes , I'm good with people . 
 I'd like to speak your export manager , please . 
 This is Mrs Wang , from Jane coper . 
 When will he come back , do you know ? 
 May I leave message ? 
 Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number . 
 thank you . goodbye . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 Sure , I can take you there actually . 
 It's fine . I was heading there anyway . 
 Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please . 
 This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . 
 We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling . 

Are you OK there ? 
 Can I help ? 
 Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . 
 What is it ? 
 Let me see . Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Susan Lee . Oh , I don't know ... 
 What about my resume ? 
 Thanks , Mary . You are real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . 
 Is this about the Sales Assistant position ? 
 Mr wilson is on the line right now . Please have a seat . He'll be right with you . 
 Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? 

How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina . 
 Please have a seat . I know our employment of forcer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . 
 You'll be covered by our medical plan while on duty.Since you'll be middle management , you're expected to be available up to 1.5 hours past normal working hours.Any approved time over that will be paid at time and a half , which you can take as salary or time off . 
 A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company.Any extended illness will be covered by insurance.Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Yes , it is , but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager . 
 Good.Now , if you'll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . 
 What's your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes Mr.Chou . We have been looking forward to this . 
 Ok , I will call you if you give me your name card . 
 In that case , just tell me your phone number . 

It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? 
 But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now . 
 I've been fed up with study . 
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? 

Good morning . My name is Mr . Brown . I ’ m from Australia . Here is my card . 
 Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people . 
 Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . 

Good afternoon . I am Mr . Brown , the Import manager of Atlantic Industries Ltd , Sidney , Australia . This is my card . 
 Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ d prefer coffee if you don ’ t mind . 
 No , it ’ s the fourth time . 
 Yes , a great deal . The business scope has been broadened , and there are more visitors than ever before . 
 Oh , yes . Quite a bit . But we are especially interested in your products . 
 Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ? 

May I see you around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning , please ? 
 Don't worry . I'll be there right on time . 
 Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? 
 Your desire coincides with ours . 
 Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mu - dual benefit . Establishing business relations between us will be to our mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about closer ties between us . 
 We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us . 

Hi , this is Ralph Simmons . With whom am I speaking ? 
 I ’ m hoping you can sort a few things out for me . Could you pull up my account ? 

Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . 
 Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . 

What kind of job do you think I should get ? 

Why didn't you sign the contract ? 

The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality . 

When should I make my presence known ? 

The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? 
 It better be more than last year . 

I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . 
 Why not ? 
 What are you talking about , we tried everything ! 
 I'm in favor of Maggie . 
 That's right , Nigel . I think we can keep cost down . 

I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together . 
 I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements . 
 I will do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price . 
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice . 
 You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . 

Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? 
 Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . 
 How are you getting along with your business ? 
 I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . 
 Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days . 
 I got fired . 
 It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . 
 I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . 
 Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . 
 I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . 
 Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . 
 It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? 
 The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . 
 Hello , this is Mr . Morris Pitt . I'd like to speak to Mr . Bell , please . 
 Please have him call me at my office . He knows the number . 

Are you doing anything right now , Diana ? 
 Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? 
 Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract . 
 Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? 
 No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . 
 Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . 
 Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . 
 Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Haven't seen you for a long time . Can I help you ? 
 Let me see if he is free . Would you please sit down and wait for a moment ? 
 The manager will come to see you in a few minutes . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes . I sent in my resume at the end of last week . I'm applying for the accounts assistant position . 
 My name is Judy Liao . That's spelled L I A O . 
 Not really . I was in the neighborhood , and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , maybe . The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume , a cover letter , and two letters of recommendation . I included those things in the envelope . Is there anything else I should send ? 
 Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? 
 I see . Well , thank you very much for helping me . You have been very helpful . 
 Thank you . 

Have you ever worked as a tour guide ? 
 Then you may know that it's hard work . 
 Have you applied with any other companies ? 
 Is there anything you want to ask about ? 
 Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ? 
 All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . 
 Good-bye . 
 In three months or so ? 
 Did I ? Well . Anyway , you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 

Liz , do you have a minute ? 
 I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . 
 Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? 
 Good . So you will have no trouble finding it . 
 I will talk about developing sales through our website.All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff . 
 Well , I need the display monitor.But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else . 

Excuse me , I am Dunlin . I am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . Are there still any vacancies ? 
 Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it . 
 Yes . I have been a guide for two years . 
 I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . 
 No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . 
 Thank you . It's my honor . 
 Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . 
 If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . 
 Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? 
 That's strange . 
 Are you hungry ? 
 I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . 
 They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . 
 For whom ? Cortex ? 
 I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . 
 Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . 
 No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? 

Well , Yuri , tell me about it . 
 That's what I was afraid of . 
 Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . 
 Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! 
 It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? 
 Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible . 
 Yes , Yuri ? 
 Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? 
 Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . 
 Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! 
 You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? 
 Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? 
 I'm sorry , but he's not in the office now . Do you have an appointment ? 
 Yes . What time did he expect you ? 
 I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ... 
 I know . He's usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side . 
 Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week ? 
 He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? 
 Morning or afternoon ? 
 I can put you down for ten o'clock . Is that alright ? 
 Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday . 
 You are welcome . 
 Good morning . 
 No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . 
 Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . 
 No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . 
 I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . 
 It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . 
 Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . 
 The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . 
 Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . 
 I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . 
 Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . 
 I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . 
 No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . 
 I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . 
 Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . 

Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ? 
 I'll see a piece available , who should I say is calling , please ? 
 Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ? 
 I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free . 
 Could I have your name again , please ? 
 And the number ? 
 Ok , you will be hearing from Mr Wood later in the afternoon then , Mr John . 
 You are welcome , goodbye . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . 
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! 
 I know . But hard work pays off , you know . 
 Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . 
 I am the manager.Can I help you ? 
 All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? 
 So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? 
 Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here . 
 That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? 
 Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? 
 Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . 
 That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? 
 Ok.Let ' s make is next Monday . I n the end , you need to fill out the application form . 

Marketing manage office , can I help you ? 
 Sorry , he's out . 
 Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? 
 That's fine.please call again later . 

I'm going to the fair now.if any one looks for me . ask them to call the fair . 
 8826789 4 , extension to 208 
 About ten.another thing is that I want an appointment with the customer at Changing hotel at three thirty this afternoon.please help me phone the customer so we can confirm now . 
 You can check them from the fax yesterday . 
 No , I'll discuss the business with him at hotel . 
 I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . 
 I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . 
 The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . 
 I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . 
 I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . 
 I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . 
 I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . 
 Yes . But he is meeting a client . 
 I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . 

Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ? 
 May I know who's calling ? 
 I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ? 
 Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead . 
 You are welcome . 
 I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . 
 It broke down one year ago . 
 The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . 
 What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . 
 I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . 
 I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems . 
 No . That's all , I guess . 
 All right . See you later . 

Do you have a free moment ? 
 I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? 
 Silly me . 
 Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? 

Come in , please . 
 Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please . 
 Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ? 
 For how long ? 
 Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ? 
 You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent . 
 I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed . 
 Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you . 
 Goodbye ! 
 Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . 
 I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . 
 They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? 
 Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . 
 Anytime . Let me know how it works out . 
 Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? 
 How about sick days ? 
 Any other benefits ? 
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . 

So how was your interview ? 
 Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . 
 Remember , they want someone who works well with people . You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . 

Hello , this is Mary from the Taipei new station , what can i do for you ? 
 Hi , Mr Wang , who do you wish to speak to ? 
 Davids who , we have 5 Davids in the office . 
 Please hold on a minute , offer your call to Mr Richton . 
 You are welcome . 
 if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company . 
 thanks . 
 I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now . 
 yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement . 
 well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . 
 yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too . 
 yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job . 
 ok . Thanks for your support . 
 I'm sorry , he's out at the moment . 
 I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Ok . Does he know your number ? 
 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , yes , Mr Wang , i look at your resume you emailed , very impressive , are you a P . M . ~ meet someone like you , i was thinking of calling you this afternoon , and having a telephone interview . 

How do you like your work ? 
 What do you do ? 
 Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . 
 I'm a clerk in a shop . 
 Not really . What ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . 

Good afternoon , ABC Incorporated . How many I direct your call ? 
 I am sorry , sir . He isn't in right now . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 And your company name , please . 
 Is there a telephone number where you can be reached ?

Is this American Airlines ? 
 I need to get a flight to Chicago on the 7th in the morning . Can you give me a hand ? 

morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . 

Hello , Mr . Kramer . Could you spare a minute ? 
 I need to talk to you about that new secretary you ’ Ve hired . I think I ’ m going to have some problems working with her . 

sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this . 
 It ’ s badly organized . I can ’ t present this to the board . 

Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ? 
 I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ? 

Ms . Montgomery ? Do you have a moment ? 
 I ’ m a bit upset about this year ’ s bonus . I was really expecting a little more . Are there any problems with my work ? 

Carla , I know you ’ re kind of new in this business and I want to give you some advice . 
 You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes . 

Would you please take a seat over there , madam ? I ’ ll let Mr . Emory know that you ’ re here . 
 Well , it may take some time . Mr . Emory ’ s at a meeting at the moment . It would probably be more comfortable over there . 

Mr . Emory ? I ’ d appreciate it if you would look over these letters before you leave today . 
 Thank you , sir . I ’ ll leave them here . If there are no problems , I ’ ll mail them out this afternoon . 

Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer . 
 For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model . 

Solomon , I thought we had agreed to change this deadline . 
 I ’ ll have to think about that , Ms . Solomon . 

Excuse me , Ms . Montgomery ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll come back later . 

We ’ re going to need a lot of new stuff after the holidays . Let ’ s make a list . 
 Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter . 

Is this supply ? 
 This is Rachel in Human Resources . I need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes . 

You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for . 
 I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . 

Cindy ! Are you getting take-out ? 
 Yeah , thanks . Could you pick me up a chicken salad sandwich , an order of fries , and a large diet coke ? 

Then , Mary . We need 10 more loose-leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did I say ? 
 Right . And I ’ d like one of those new electric pencil sharpeners . 

Liz , you were supposed to have had those contracts typed up by now . 
 No , Liz . I asked you specifically . Don ’ t you remember ? 

Rachel ? I ’ m not sure how you want to handle this account . I think there are a few things to be sorted out . 
 That ’ s true . But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set . 

Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . 
 Well , I want a note from the doctor on this one . And , to be honest , if this continues , we may not be able to employ you here . 

Martin ? Did you remember to bring back that software I lent you ? 
 That ’ s okay , Martin . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I ’ d appreciate it . 

John ? Can you come over here for a second ? 
 I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems . 

These two sections need to be re-written , Jerry . The last guy that did this really mixed things up . 
 Not until next week , I think , the 15th . 

What are you guys doing over there ? 
 I ’ Ve been waiting for a response on the Blake Building design for nearly two weeks . 

Mr . Phillips ? I have a request here from purchasing that needs your approval . 
 I believe it ’ s going to Ms . Wilson ’ s office . 

Mark ? I need that file you took yesterday . 
 Mark , I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today . 

Excuse me , sir ? I ’ m afraid this is a no-smoking area . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Smoking is not permitted in this area . 

This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . 
 The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands . 

Hi , Alex . Would you come with me to supply ? I ’ Ve got to pick up a load of stuff and I ’ m afraid I can ’ t carry it all . 
 Thanks . I appreciate the hand . I ’ d have to make two or three trips on my own . 

I really just have two problems with this . 
 I ’ m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and , frankly , your age , you ’ re pretty new at all this . 

Mrs . Montgomery ? I ’ Ve been trying to figure out when we should have the New Year ’ s party . Could you take a book at these dates ? 
 Well , why don ’ t we make it the thirtieth ? We can set it up from three to five . That way , everybody can just go home afterwards . 

Hi , Carlos . What are you doing this afternoon ? 
 Well . I was just wondering if you would come by and give me a hand with the fliers for next week ’ s party . 

Susan , we ’ re going to need those data before tomorrow . 
 Yeah ? All right . Thanks , Susan . 

Mr . Martin ? I need to talk to you for a minute . 
 Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule . 

Mr . Blake ? Mr . Foster ’ s on the phone . He ’ d like to know if you can send over those training manuals ? 
 He was hoping that you could drop them off this afternoon . 

Can we talk about this bonus plan of yours ? I ’ Ve got a few problems with it . 
 Well , to be honest , I just don ’ t think we ’ re going to have enough funds to give the kind of bonuses you have in mind . 

Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . 

I ’ m not sure what you expect me to do , Michelle . You ’ Ve not been very clear about any of this . 
 Yeah . I think that would be a good idea . I ’ m really in the dark on everything . 

I ’ m sorry to disturb you , Mr . Crane . 
 Could you please look over these resumes ? They ’ Ve just come in . 

Jason . There ’ s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center . 
 Well , it was . But the contractor ’ s just told me he ’ s not going to be able to finish by the twentieth , as planned . 

Excuse me , Mr . White ? I just need you to sign these before I leave . 
 That ’ s my job , sir . Just one more signature here , please . 

Albert ? Could you co-sign this approval sheet ? Accounting ’ s getting really picky . 
 Right here . It ’ s for that new fax machine we ’ re getting . 

Could you call Mr . Jacob for me , Sara ? I need to go over some stuff with him . 
 Sure , it ’ s 4-8- 7-2 . Don ’ t worry . You ’ re doing a fine job . 

Hi , Brad . How are you today ? 
 No problem . Is this the only one ? 

Hello , Mr . Compton ? This is Susan Miller . 
 I ’ d like to take tomorrow off if that ’ s all right with you . 

Excuse me , Mr . Macmillan ? 
 I was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation . I want to enter a Master ’ s program in marketing . It ’ s all on weekends and evenings . 

Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ? 
 I would like to leave a few minutes early today . Would that be all right ? 

John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today . 
 I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . 

Hello , Ms . Murphy ? 
 It ’ s John Anderson . I ’ m afraid I ’ m going to be out sick today . I ’ Ve got a nasty cold . I hope you don ’ t mind , ma ’ am . 

morning . Macmillan and Emory . May I help you ? 
 No , I ’ m sorry . You ’ Ve reached Mr . Macmillan ’ s office . Let me just put you through to accounting . 

Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking . 
 No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ? 

Jason Emory speaking . 
 Yeah . They were just sent over to your office . You should have them in about half an hour . 

Hello . Mr . Rodriguez ? 
 Yes , sir . I ’ Ve just dropped those slides off at the Winthrop office . Do you need anything else while I ’ m out ? 

Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . 

Hi , is this Rich ? 
 It ’ s Alex ... Have I got some great news ! We got the Baker account . It ’ s all ours ! 

Greg . I want to speak to you for a minute . 
 I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already . 

Farmington ? Would you take a look at these catalogue ads that Roger did ? I don ’ t think we can use them . 
 I know , Mr . Farmington . But , I ’ m not sure that I should bring this up with him . I think it would be better if you spoke to him . 

Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work . 
 I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance . 

Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem . 
 My daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ’ ll be about two hours late . 
 Okay , Mark , What ’ s up ? 
 That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . 
 Hi , Martin . What can I do for you ? 
 That ’ s all right . Bring me over what you ’ Ve got . 
 What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! 
 I ’ Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ’ t think it ’ s worth it . 
 Yes , Miss Parks ? How may I help you ? 
 I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like . 
 I thought you knew , Todd . It was decided last week . I guess you weren ’ t at the meeting . 
 I ’ m sorry . Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you . 
 Hi , this is Sharon in Mr . Reynolds ’ s office . One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago . 
 Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . 
 Good morning , Ms . Walker . What can I do for you ? 
 Of course , Ms . Walker . Could I have your account number , please ? And , when do these documents need to arrive ? 
 Good afternoon . Lilian . This is Tom Baker over at Beck ’ s Trading company . We need to arrange a banquet for next Wednesday afternoon . 
 Well . We ’ re expecting about twenty-five people and we ’ d like to spend no more than $ 20 a head . 
 Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips . 
 Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon . 
 Yes , madam . May I help you ? 
 Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ? 
 Of course , Mr . Kramer . How are things going these days ? 
 Congratulations ! I ’ m really glad to hear it ! That should make balancing the books a lot easier ! 
 Alex . It ’ s Nancy over in Marketing . I ’ Ve got some good news for you . 
 Mr . Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan ! 
 Hi , Robert . This is Janet Reese calling from American Advertising . We placed an order with you about a week ago . 
 Well , it still hasn ’ t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it . 
 This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ? 
 Hello , Chris . How can I help you ? 
 I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ... 
 Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ’ s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory . 
 Hi , Karen . This is John Williams in the purchasing department . Can you check to see if there ’ s a package down there for me ? 
 Thanks , Karen . 
 Yes , Mr . Emory ? 
 I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . 
 Hi , Susan . What ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I have no idea . I haven ’ t seen that for ages . 
 Hi Angie , it ’ s Tom Reynolds here . Can you tell me if my tuition fees for this semester have been approved ? 
 Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie ! 
 How big , Elizabeth ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 3 nights in a row ! 
 All right , Elizabeth . But this is the last time . 
 No , ma ’ am . This is Sean . Steven ’ s out sick . 

The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? 

Hey , Doug ! How ’ d it go at that meeting yesterday ? I know you were pretty anxious about it . 
 Great ! When do you take over ? 

Hello . I need to speak with Allan Cartwright . 
 I certainly hope so , I am about to stop doing business with your office . 

Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . 
 Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . 

Print shop . Seam speaking . 
 It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . 

I ’ m interested in teaching at your school . 
 Yes . 
 I have a TEFL certificate . 
 I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . 
 I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . 
 Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . 
 Yes , just a little . 
 I sure can . 

Good morning , Wilson Association . 
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Tomas left here just a few minutes ago . 
 I'm afraid not . He is away for the rest of the day . 
 I'm afraid not , he has gone out of this town on business . May I take a message ? 
 Would you like to make another appointment ? 
 I see . I'll tell Mr.Tomas you've called . 

Hello ! 
 I'm sorry , I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Petti here . 
 I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years . 
 No , It isn't . It's 736-4565 . It seems you've misdialed . 
 That's all right . This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone . 
 No worries . 
 This is Jane , I'd like to speak to Mr.Wang , please . 
 When do you expect him back ? 
 Yes , thank you . When he gets back , please just let him know that jane called . And i need him to call me back . 
 Yes , he does . But i give it to you again . 5264453 6 
 Yes , thank you very much . 

I would like to take my vacation next month . 
 I would like to take my two weeks vacation time . 
 Great . I will make my reservations as necessary . 

I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? 
 We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . 
 I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . 
 Let's give it a shot ! 
 What kind of benefits are we talking about ? 
 Are these things negotiable ? 
 Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . 
 Possibly . What do you have in mind ? 
 You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? 
 That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then . 
 No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork . 
 Well I ’ m impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company ’ s future can only be brighter . I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation 
 Yes , I believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me , not just if I ’ m right for the company . I ’ Ve only been impressed by what I ’ Ve read and heard and I see myself having 
 Well I ’ m definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated . I believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility . Therefore you will find in me 
 Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . 
 Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . 
 No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention 
 Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . 
 To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on 
 That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail 
 I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled 

Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . 
 I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? 
 What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? 

I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute . 
 It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . 
 Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . 
 I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . 
 I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . 
 Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? 
 That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . 
 That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? 

Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? 
 I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? 
 That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? 
 I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . 
 So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . 
 Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession . 
 No . 
 Not at all . Go right ahead . 
 It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . 
 Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . 

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? 
 Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . 
 Where do you see yourself five years from now ? 

Good evening , sir . Welcome to the Comfort Inn . 
 Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? 
 Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while 
 Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta 
 ( later ) Here ’ s your card , sir . You ’ re all checked in . let me just tell you about a few of our services . We have free breakfast in the lounge from 7:00- 9:00 . You call the receptionist to arrange 
 Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . 
 I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? 
 So who has to stay behind ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! 
 I hope you enjoyed your stay . 
 Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . 
 That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . 
 Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . 
 Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . 
 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? 
 What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? 
 I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! 
 Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . 
 Do you want the large size , or the small size ? 
 Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? 
 A bottle of glue . 
 I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? 
 Is that all ? 
 What else do you want ? 

Accounting , this is Mike . 
 Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . 
 Right , see you then ! 
 Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? 
 I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? 
 OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? 

Good afternoon , Mr . Dome ’ s office . 
 Yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . 
 Yes , that ’ s correct . 

Hi Ron , this is Kim at headquarters . 
 Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . 
 Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . 
 That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . 

Hi . I ’ m here to catch flight 513 to New York . 
 Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ? 
 Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? 
 Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag . 

Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . 
 You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? 
 You can reach me at 13661306917 . 
 That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . 
 I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . 
 When do you plan to travel ? 
 Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? 
 I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? 
 When would you like to return ? 
 OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 
 No , all flights are direct . 
 $ 800 dollars . 
 So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . 
 I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? 
 It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . 

Good morning . Please come into my office . 
 I see that you have some impressive writing experience . 
 Wonderful . I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? 
 It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . 
 That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . 
 Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . 
 OK . Let me send a memo around . 
 I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . 
 I know , it ’ s a big one . 
 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . 
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . 
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! 
 On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . 
 Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! 
 Can ’ t complain . And you ? 
 Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . 

Do you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? 
 It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . 
 Oh , no problem . 
 yes , but I have a few questions for you . 
 first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . 
 even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? 
 that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . 
 I see . I guess that makes sense . 
 yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? 
 how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? 
 why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? 
 I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? 

do you have a minute ? 
 I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . 
 oh , no . not at all . 
 no , sir . 
 Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . 
 it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . 
 really ? I didn't know that would be possible . 
 thanks , sir . 
 let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? 
 did you get to leave early then ? 
 it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . 
 it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . 
 I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . 
 I got sacked today . 
 well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . 
 only about 5 minutes . 
 my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . 

Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? 
 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? 
 Have you updated your CV ? 

Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? 
 well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . 
 it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . 
 well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . 
 the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . 
 I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . 
 of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . 

are you ready for the meeting ? 
 it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . 
 thanks a lot . 
 well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . 
 well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . 
 to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . 
 I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . 
 that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! 
 good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . 
 the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . 
 she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? 
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? 
 ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then . 
 I ’ m well . And you ? 
 I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . 
 I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . 
 it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! 
 our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . 
 if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . 
 we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . 
 thanks ! 
 really well , thanks . 
 she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . 
 she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . 
 they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . 
 of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . 
 sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . 
 yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . 
 I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . 
 I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 I've only found a few openings in my field . 
 I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . 
 unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . 
 yes . 
 really ? what is it ? 
 that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? 
 that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? 

I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! 
 it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . 
 that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha 
 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . 
 that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
 I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! 
 I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Yeah , I got home around two . 
 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 
 I'm in between jobs at the moment . 
 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . 
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 
 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . 
 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . 
 yes , but not fluently . 
 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . 
 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . 
 thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! 
 nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? 
 great ! 
 sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? 
 absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . 
 yes . this must be a huge difference . 
 sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . 
 and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . 
 don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . 

How's your job search going ? 
 have you finished compiling your resume ? 
 that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . 
 good . How about your cover letter ? 
 no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of 
 yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . 

I just received a phone call for an interview next week . 
 thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? 
 yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? 
 then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? 
 are there any other things I should pay attention to ? 

Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? 
 why ? 
 that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . 
 well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . 
 one person ? How about your girlfriend ? 
 sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . 
 I admire you . Good luck ! 
 sure . What do you want ? 
 really ? Why ? 
 and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 
 absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . 
 this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . 
 that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead 
 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . 
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the 
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required 
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . 
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . 
 That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . 
 yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . 
 congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . 
 no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . 
 well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . 
 that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . 
 yeah , I think so . 
 Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . 
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? 
 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . 

Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? 
 Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . 
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so 
 The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . 
 Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . 
 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . 
 Good , as long as you understand that . 
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . 

Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? 
 So , what changed ? 
 Wow , a real step up ! 
 I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? 

Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 

Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? 
 Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? 
 What would you say is your most positive quality ? 

Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? 
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . 
 Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? 
 What did that involve ? 
 I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? 

Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... 
 Certainly . And after your internship ? 
 Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . 
 The London Weekly right . 

hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? 
 thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . 
 that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . 
 I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? 
 is it ok to include the pictures ? 
 thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . 
 ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? 
 from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . 
 don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . 
 carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . 
 they usually go on for ages . 
 I will . Enjoy your meeting ! 
 hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . 
 so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . 
 one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . 
 that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . 
 sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . 
 I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . 

What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 
 What else do you suggest ? 

We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? 
 See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . 
 The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . 
 We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su 
 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . 
 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . 
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . 
 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . 
 I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of 
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? 
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . 
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . 
 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . 

Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . 
 That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . 
 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . 
 You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee 
 You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? 
 Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . 
 That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . 
 Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . 
 No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume . 
 That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . 
 Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? 
 I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? 
 Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ? 
 Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? 
 Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . 
 Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ? 
 Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is . 
 Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ’ s finished with it 
 What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . 
 Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure . 
 The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ? 
 Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ? 
 When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ? 
 I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ? 
 You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great ! 
 Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? 
 When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? 
 So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? 
 You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? 
 Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . 
 Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . 
 No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please . 
 Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? 
 Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? 
 Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? 
 How much do you need to make per year ? 
 Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you . 
 Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? 
 OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? 
 I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? 
 Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? 
 OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday . 
 Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? 
 OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? 
 That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . 
 Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? 
 Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? 
 Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you ! 
 Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? 
 Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? 
 I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? 
 Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? 
 OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? 
 Fine , we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need . See you there ! 
 I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . 
 I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . 
 Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . 

Hello . Excuse me . 
 Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . 
 I think I lost my wallet here . 
 Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? 
 Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 
 Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . 
 No . My friend did . 
 No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . 
 I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? 
 Should I call the police ? 
 Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 What ? 
 Did you open it before we left ? 
 I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? 
 It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . 
 Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . 
 Look around . 
 And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . 
 I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? 
 It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . 
 I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . 
 Not really . 
 I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . 
 Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . 
 It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . 
 They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . 
 Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . 
 That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . 
 Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . 
 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . 
 Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
 Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . 
 Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . 
 Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . 
 Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . 

Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? 

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .

Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ? 
 Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? 
 I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . 
 Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . 
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . 
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... 
 Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . 
 We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . 
 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . 
 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . 
 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . 
 Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . 
 They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters . 
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . 
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . 
 I ’ d better go tomorrow . 
 No . I couldn ’ t find a policeman . 
 Yes . I ’ ll do it tomorrow . 
 Yes ? 

What's the matter here ? 
 When did you find out ? 
 Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . 
 He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . 
 Probably . Let's check the inside then . 
 Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . 
 You mean it is not created by the burglar ? 

Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . 
 But we need the exact time . What time ? 

How do we do timesheets here ? 
 Yes , I already have one . 
 I am kind of confused . 
 I'm not quite sure . 
 No , I have no idea what you are talking about . 
 Thanks for your help . 

Can you help me with my timesheet ? 
 No , I don't know where to find one . 
 Yes , I can do that . 
 No , I don't know what that is . 
 Yes , I understand how to do this . 
 That was easy ! 

I need help with my timesheet . 
 Yes , I have seen them . 
 Yes , I understand what to do .

When could we meet to discuss the project ? 
 I prefer Monday .

 I will be prepared to do my presentation . 
 Everyone needs to be there . 
 I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . 

I want to make a phone call . Can you show me how ? 
 Yes , now what do I do ? 
 No , nothing changed . 
 I am trying to call my boss . 
 I know a few extensions but I don't know them all . 

Can you show me how to use this phone ? 
 No , I don't hear anything . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I am trying to call a client . 
 No , I don't know anyone's extension . 

I need help figuring out how to use this phone . 
 Yes , I hear the tone . 
 Yes , it changed . 
 I am trying to call home . 
 Yes , I have a list of extensions .

 OK , no problem . 
 Yes , I understand the numbers . 

I lost track of time , am I late ? 
 My friend needed me to help him . 
 I will try . My apologies . 
 Sure , I'll sit right here . 
 I am confused about the projected revenues . 

I need help with the office party . 
 I have no idea what the entertainment should be . 
 Let's make it a formal affair . 
 American food would be the best choice . 
 We should bring in a really good DJ . 

You say he was around average hight . 
 Weight ? 
 Any karks on his face ? 
 Glasses ? 
 what about his hair ? 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 
 Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . 
 Ok , now we are getting some where.Pants ? 
 What kind of shoes ? 
 Cow while Boots . 
 All right . That nearly done a little.Now I want you to look some pictures . 
 What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn't do anything . 
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . 
 I don't need your help , jerk .

 That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? 
 That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? 
 Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? 
 Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . 
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . 
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . 
 I don't remember . 
 40 miles per hour . 
 Just straight . 
 No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . 

Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don't think that there is any easy way . 
 Yeah , you are right ! 
 I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . 

Excuse me for being late to work . 
 My car broke down . 
 Yes , I'll work on it . 
 Great ! Fill me in . 
 I don't understand the projected revenues . 

There is a very critical debate between the presidential candidates tonight . 
 Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms . 
 We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for . 
 Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ? 

It's a lot of work running a campaign , isn't it ! 
 Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over . 
 About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes . 
 Did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential campaign ? 

What can I do to help you ? 
 I could do some typing for you . 
 Sure I will get to do that right now . 
 I have worked here long time . 
 I'm not sure . Let me think about it . 

I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . 
 And it takes up all the news . 
 It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . 
 I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . 

Do you need any help ? 
 I like xeroxing . 
 OK , I will get right to that . 
 I just started working here . 
 I'd like to , but I am very busy .

 My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . 
 My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . 
 Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . 
 I am not going to show any income from now on then . 

I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me . 
 I can ’ t figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week ’ s . 
 I made a little bit of money , but not much . 
 I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form . 
 That being the case , I don ’ t think that I am going to show the income next time . 

Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back . 
 Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ? 

I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why . 
 I am afraid that I forgot to send it in . 
 Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ? 
 I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . 
 Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? 

All right , Mr . Crane , when will you be arriving in the city ? 
 Only 25 minutes or so . We ’ ll send somebody to meet you . That ’ s 11:30 a . m . Friday the 15th ? 

morning , Mr . Winthrop . This is Sally Parker , Mr . Emory ’ s secretary . Mr . Emory has asked me to set up a meeting with you . 
 I understand . Would you like me to call you back ? 

Roger ? Would it be possible to meet with you to discuss my department ’ s budget ? 
 All right . That ’ ll be fine . Can you put together a rough idea of the kind of money I ’ ll have available for the next year ? 

Richard ! I need those tax forms from you before five ! 
 Okay . The sooner the better . 

I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime . 
 Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow . 

Thank you for your application , Mr . Sweeney . Mr . Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week . Do you have time ? 
 Fine . Let me take a look at his schedule . He ’ s free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 . Could you come in then ? 

morning , Mr . Emory . I was hoping to set up an appointment with you for sometime this week . 
 Fine , Mr . Emory . Would next Monday at 4:00 o ’ clock be all right for you ? 

I definitely want to meet with you , Mr . Parker . I just need to sort out my schedule . 
 I realize that . We don ’ t have any time to waste . I can put you down for 9:20 . Could you make that , Mr . Parker ? 

Hello ? Is this the Maintenance Department ? 
 We ’ re having a lot of trouble with our printer . Could you come and take a look at it sometime this afternoon ? 

Paul , can I set up a time with you to go over the training manual ? 
 Tuesday morning is good for me . How about 10:30 in my office ? 

I ’ ll need to meet with you before you go on vacation , Alex . I have a few things to clear up . 
 That ’ s fine . I can make that . 

Hello . Mr . Othman ? This is Michael in Mr . Emory ’ s office . He ’ d like to set up and appointment with you to talk about buying a new copier . 
 He ’ d like to do it as soon as possible , sir . How about tomorrow at 2:45 ? 

Tom , this is Mary Bobbins . She ’ s just come over from sales . 
 Yes , she ’ ll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things . 

morning , Mr . Montgomery . I ’ Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . 
 Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! 

Excuse me , Richard ? Are you busy at the moment ? 
 My fax machine ’ s on the blink . Would you take a look at it ? 

Hi , John Phillips ? I ’ m Rose Green . I ’ Ve been asked to handle your training and introduce a little bit of the company to you . It ’ s nice to meet you . 
 After a week , you ’ ll be running around here like a pro . Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager . 

Excuse me . Mr . Emory ? 
 I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment . 

Mr . Crane ’ s office . Sandy speaking . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Knight . When would you like to meet with him ? 

All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ? 
 I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ’ t you guys get started and I ’ ll come by at around 8 

Excuse me , Alex ? 
 I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll . 

I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ? 
 That ’ s out for me . I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a . m . How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 

Paul ? I need to work out a time to get together with your people . 
 It would be best if everybody could be there . How about next week sometime ? 

Let ’ s meet before next week ’ s meeting , Jane . I want to kick around some ideas with you . 
 Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ? 

Well , I ’ m glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I ’ m really not in a position to make a decision right now . 
 Yeah , why don ’ t you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week . 

Susan ? We ’ re having a farewell party for John Anderson today . 
 We ’ re starting at 12:00 and it ’ ll go on for the rest of the afternoon . 

I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things . 
 Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 

Excuse me , Bill ? 
 Fine , thanks . Mr . Emory would like to meet with Mr . Macmillan tomorrow afternoon . Can you take a look at his book ? 

Grant . How is everything ? 
 Sure . What ’ s it about ? 

Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . 
 I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . 

Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . 
 He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting . 

John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . 
 That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! 

Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . 
 No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . 

Why are you in court today ? 
 Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? 
 Tell me what happened . 
 The officer wouldn't lie about that . 
 There was no picture taken of your license plate ? 
 I'm just going to let you go . 

how are you doing ? 
 what happened to him ? 
 was it his first offence ? 
 what happened to him then ? 
 did they take his license away ? 
 what do you think will happen to him ? 
 that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? 
 my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . 

What's going on here ? 
 Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? 
 Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ? 
 Is he at home ? 

911 emergency . What is the problem ? 
 When was this break-in ? 
 Where was the break-in ? 
 Was anything stolen ? 
 Why do you think there was a break-in ? 
 We'll send a squad car shortly . 

Did you hear anything about the robbery ? 
 Really ? 
 What did you see ? 
 I can't believe it . 
 What happened next ? 
 Did he get caught ? 

How may I help you ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What is your trial about ? 
 I ’ d be glad to help . 
 My rate is $ 150 an hour . 
 I don ’ t know what to tell you . 

Hello , may I speak to you for a few minutes ? 
 I want to speak to you about this year ’ s election . 
 Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign . 
 I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it . 
 Will you be voting ? 
 Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day . 

Could I speak to you for a minute ? 
 I want to talk about this year ’ s election . 
 I am volunteering for the campaign . 
 I want to be a part of history . 
 Do you plan on voting ? 
 You should try and make it early to your polling place . 

Are you going to vote on Tuesday ? 
 I ’ Ve already voted . 
 I sent in an absentee ballot . 
 I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday . 
 I have to work . 
 I have important business to take care of that morning . 

Did you need help ? 
 I ’ ll help you with that . 
 I ’ m working here today . 
 Can I see your ID , please ? 
 I have your ballot card right here . 
 All you have to do now is vote . 

Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ? 
 We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? 
 I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ? 
 You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . 

Good afternoon . What service do you require ? 
 For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see . 
 What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? 
 Certainly , just fill in this form , please . 
 Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office . 
 I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . 
 That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . 
 OK , I'll take a small , for 1 year , in this branch , please . 
 Hi , I have a checking account with you . 
 I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet . 

Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ? 
 That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you . 
 Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? 
 Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful . 

Hello , Lincoln Bank . Kristy speaking , how may I help you today ? 
 I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too . 
 You'll need to deposit 1,500 RIB initially . There will also be some small additional charges for this service . 
 It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents . 

Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? 
 Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir . 
 We do require a deposit before we can issue you with a personal credit card . 
 The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well . 

IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ? 
 I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them . 
 What repayment period were you thinking of ? 
 A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan . 
 Well , we could adjust the interest rate based on the original rate and the amount of days you actually borrowed the money for . 
 It's our pleasure . We are always happy to have another satisfied customer . Thanks for calling . Goodbye . 
 I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . 
 That might be a good idea , yes . 
 I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . 
 No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . 
 I need some advice about my fixed deposits . 
 No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . 
 Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . 
 Yes ... 
 That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in . 
 Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? 
 I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? 
 Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? 
 The list goes on and on ! 
 So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank . 
 Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . 
 She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . 
 I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . 
 Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . 

Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? 
 Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . 
 Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . 

Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . 
 It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . 
 Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . 
 Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . 

Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? 
 That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . 
 If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . 
 There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? 

Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? 
 That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . 
 Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % 
 We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . 

Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? 
 That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . 
 What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . 
 Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . 
 A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 

Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? 
 Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . 
 No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . 
 Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? 
 I can ask for some advice from him . 
 Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . 
 Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . 
 Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . 
 Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . 
 Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! 
 I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . 
 Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . 
 When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . 
 As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . 
 I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . 
 Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Why such a big difference ? 
 My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? 
 That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . 
 Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . 
 Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . 
 Really ? 
 So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? 
 How so ? 
 Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . 
 Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . 
 Is there anything else ? 
 And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . 
 In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . 
 Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . 
 Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . 
 That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . 
 The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . 
 That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . 
 I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . 
 Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . 
 Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . 
 I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? 
 I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . 
 Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . 
 That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . 
 Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? 
 Certainly ... 
 Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . 
 Check , check and check . 
 Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? 
 No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account . 
 I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . 
 Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? 
 Could I open an account with you today ? 
 Yes , here you go . And sign here ? 
 So quick and easy ! Thanks very much . 
 Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . 
 No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . 
 Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days . 
 Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you . 
 Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now . 
 Speaking . 
 Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . 
 Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? 
 I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? 
 Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye . 
 I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . 
 Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon . 
 I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . 
 800 RIB , please . 
 OK ... 
 Yes , that's great . Thanks . 
 This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . 
 That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . 
 Shall I come in and collect it ? 
 Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . 
 I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks . 
 Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . 
 I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . 
 No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! 
 Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? 
 Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . 
 I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . 
 Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . 
 I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . 
 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . 
 OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . 
 That's fine . OK . Thanks . 
 I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? 
 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! 
 Fine . Here you go . 
 Is it OK to withdraw USD ? 
 OK , 200 USD , please . 
 Perfect . Thanks ! 
 I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? 
 A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? 
 But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . 
 I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . 
 I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? 
 A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . 
 A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks . 
 Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . 
 It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . 
 I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . 

Welcome to IBA . Do you need any assistance ? 
 I see . We offer Personal Housing Loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0.42 % per month . 
 We offer many different payment plans . Would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? Are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? 
 Then we can certainly help you with that . You see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate . 
 I'll get our Mortgage Adviser for you . Please take a seat , I won't be a minute . 
 Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? 
 I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . 
 So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? 
 That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . 
 I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . 
 That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . 
 That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . 
 The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . 
 I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . 
 Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? 
 I see . What about age limitations ? 
 Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . 
 Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . 
 Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? 
 Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . 
 OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . 
 I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . 
 How can you help me ? 
 That ’ s great . 
 Here it is . 
 What do I do now ? 
 All right . Thanks for your help . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Really ? 
 Voting is simple . 
 That ’ s okay . They describe everything on the ballot . 
 Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll be fine . 
 Congratulations on your first voting day . 
 I am . Are you ? 
 Is that right ? 
 Voting isn ’ t difficult . 
 They tell you everything on the ballot . 
 You ’ ll be okay . 
 You should be excited about your first vote . 
 Of course ! Will you ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Voting is easy . 
 The ballot gives you all that information . 
 You have nothing to worry about . 
 Good luck on your first election . 
 Why are you so excited ? 
 This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? 
 That is so lucky of you . 
 You turned 18 a month before the election . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Congratulations on being a part of history . 
 I sure did ! 
 I voted for Obama . 
 I knew he would win . 
 He was the best candidate this year . 
 I guess America is finally maturing . 

I am so excited ! 
 I just voted . 
 Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . 
 Why is that ? 
 I didn ’ t think about it like that . 
 No , but that makes me even more excited . 

Can you tell that I ’ m excited ? 
 I voted today . 
 I just turned 18 a month ago . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn ’ t even think of that . 
 I really didn ’ t , but I ’ m still excited . 

Did you vote ? 
 Who was your vote for President ? 
 I didn ’ t expect him to win . 
 What made you think that ? 
 I thought his race would have kept him from winning . 
 That ’ s true . 

National Trust . 
 Just one second , and I'll check . 

Union Bank . How can I be of service ? 
 I'll need your name and account number . 

You voted , right ? 
 Who did you vote for ? 
 Can you believe that he actually won ? 
 I didn ’ t think he would . 
 I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . 
 You ’ re absolutely right . 

Hello , there . You are looking a little confused ; can I help you with something ? 
 Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine . 
 Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen . 
 And press ' enter ' to confirm , here . Now you need to decide which service you need . 
 That's the beauty of these machines , you can do almost anything . And unlike a person , they don't usually take breaks or go off sick ! 
 Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ? 
 I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ? 
 Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? 
 Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you . 
 Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . 

Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? 
 Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for . 
 Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . 
 Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . 
 Yes , then enter the amount you want . 

City Bank . This is Tom . May I help you ? 
 Sure , may I have your name and account number please ? 
 I'm here , hello . 
 I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel . 
 I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ? 
 But , what do I do if I need cash ? 
 Thank you so much . I'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow . Thanks again for all of your help . 
 Client Services ? Oh , hello . I need your help . 
 I'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately I've lost my card ! 
 Credit Card . The International Credit Card , I can't find it anywhere . 
 I'm not 100 % sure , around an hour ago I guess . I had it in the hotel lobby bar ; I used it to charge something to my room . I obviously didn't pick it up again . 
 Thank you . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I'm here . What details do you need from me ? 
 Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet . 
 Please , go right ahead . 
 I'm Mike Kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . I'm not sure what they are . 
 It's 671029 , my birthday . Silly to choose such a simple one , I suppose ! 

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Which service do you require today ? 
 We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ? 
 I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans . 
 Certainly . It's quite simple really . Do you hold a resident's permit ? 
 That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation . 

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Are you a new customer ? 
 I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . 
 May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? 
 We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . 

As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? 
 Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... 
 You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . 
 We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . 
 If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . 

Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ? 
 OK , Madam . We are here to help . 
 I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . 
 The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . 
 Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . 

Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? 
 Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? 
 I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions . 
 I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . 

Loans Department , how can I help you ? 
 Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . 
 That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . 
 The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . 
 The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . 
 My pleasure , Sir . Bye . 
 Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? 
 I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . 
 So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? 
 I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . 
 Yes . Will you ? 
 How did you do that ? 
 Why is that ? 
 What ’ s the reason for that ? 
 You can just go to work after you vote . 
 I get it now . 
 I ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot . 
 How are you going to help me ? 
 Fabulous . Thanks . 
 I have it right here . 
 Now what am I supposed to do ? 
 Sounds good . Thanks . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 What do you mean you already voted ? 
 Why ’ d you have to do that ? 
 Why is that ? 
 You can always go to work late . 
 Oh , I understand . 
 I ’ m so happy about that . 
 I sure did . How about you ? 
 I have complete confidence in our new President . 
 I know he will help change America . 
 I feel like things are already changing , because he was elected . 
 I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands . 
 I can ’ t believe that Obama won . 
 I know ! He just made history ! 
 I did . Did you ? 
 I am so happy that he is our new President ! 
 I hope that he brings change to America . 
 I have faith in our new President . 
 I am proud to know that he is our President . 
 Did you vote for him , because I know that I did . 
 I have nothing but faith in Obama . 
 I ’ m sure he will help better America . 
 Our country is already changing as it is . 
 I trust that he will take good care of our country . 
 No , who was it ? 
 You ’ re a liar ! 
 Who voted for him ? 
 That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . 
 What could be worse than what you just told me ? 
 That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there . 
 I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . 
 Of course I did . Didn ’ t you ? 
 I have total faith in Obama as our President . 
 Yeah . I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf . 
 I believe that change has already begun . 
 I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country . 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too . 
 Would you like to ask me anything ? 
 I think everyone has the right to love who they want . 
 Yes , I would . 
 I ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage . 
 I really appreciate that . 
 Yes . Are you ? 
 What ’ s your polling place ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 I don ’ t know . 
 The location of my polling place never came in the mail . 
 Let me go do that . 
 I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . 
 He just made history . 
 Of course I did . Did you ? 
 I am really excited about this . 
 Hopefully , he ’ ll change things in our nation . 
 I trust him . 
 Yeah . I am so excited that Obama won . 
 That man just made history . 
 I sure did ! What about you ? 
 I am still in shock to know that he was elected . 
 I pray that he actually makes things better in this country . 
 I know he will , too . 
 I sure am . How about you ? 
 Do you know where your polling place is ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 I ’ m not sure . 
 I didn ’ t receive my polling place in the mail . 
 I didn ’ t know that . I ’ ll go look right now . 
 Of course . What about you ? 
 Where is your polling place ? 
 Oh , is that right ? 
 I have no idea . 
 Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place . 
 Oh , really ? Thanks , I ’ m going to do that right now . 
 I ’ m going to work . 
 I ’ m going to work at the polling place . 
 I work there every year . 
 I applied for the job online . 
 It ’ s a fun job . 
 They pay enough . 
 I have to go to work . 
 I ’ m working at the polling place .

 It ’ s a very cool job . 
 They pay well enough . 
 I ’ m on my way to work . 
 I work at the polling place . 
 I do this every year . 
 I applied online . 
 I enjoy working there every year . 
 They pay just enough . 
 What are you collecting donations for ? 
 How much are you planning on raising ? 
 What kind of fundraisers are you doing ? 
 You should try actual fundraisers , too . 
 Try having a car wash or selling candy . 
 I know . It ’ ll also help you make more money . 
 What are you getting donations for ? 
 How much money are you looking to make ? 
 Are you doing different fundraisers ? 
 You should do something else . 
 Try a car wash and selling candy . 
 You ’ ll make more money that way . 
 Donations for what ? 
 How much money are you trying to raise ? 
 What are you doing to raise money ? 
 You should try other fundraisers . 
 You can always wash cars and sell candy . 
 That ’ ll help you make more money . 
 No , who won ? 
 What ? You can ’ t be serious ! 
 Why would anyone vote for McCain ? 
 That ’ s horrible . 
 More bad news ? 
 Are you serious this time ? That ’ s wonderful news . 
 I can ’ t wait to vote . 
 The person I ’ m voting for is the best . 
 He is very intelligent . 
 That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . 
 I ’ m voting for the next President . 
 I ’ m going to make sure and vote . 
 Who was elected ? 
 That can ’ t be true ! 
 I can ’ t believe people voted for him . 
 That doesn ’ t make any sense . 
 How could the news get any worse ? 
 That ’ s great news ! 
 It ’ s very nice meeting you , too . 
 What would you like to ask me ? 
 I feel that people can love who they want . 
 Of course ! 
 I can ’ t help that . 
 I hope so . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 You can ask me questions , if you ’ d like . 
 Everyone should be able to love who they want . 
 I sure would . 
 That ’ s not my problem . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that . 
 Yes , I am , and I am so excited . 
 I love my candidate . 
 My candidate is probably the most intelligent . 
 I also agree with all his policies . 
 I know he ’ s going to be the next President . 
 I can ’ t wait to vote . 
 What would you like to speak to me about ? 
 Is that right ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . 
 That ’ s fantastic . 
 I ’ m going to vote . 
 I will . Good luck with your volunteering . 
 I am so excited to be voting . 
 I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for . 
 I feel that he is very intelligent . 
 Yes , and I agree with all his policies . 
 I think this man is going to be the next President . 
 I ’ m going to make sure and get my vote in . 
 How are you doing ? 
 Go for it . 
 I voted this morning . 
 I can ’ t tell you that . 
 That is private information . 
 All I can tell you is our next President got my vote . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Sure , you can . 
 I sure did ! 
 I can ’ t disclose that information . 
 My vote is my own private business . 
 I voted for our next President . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 Ask away . 
 I already voted . 
 I ’ m not going to tell you . 
 My vote is personal . 
 What I can tell you is that I voted for our next President of the United States . 
 Of course ! Are you ? 
 You should know that . 
 The election is this Tuesday . 
 I ’ m not kidding . 
 That should ’ Ve been something you knew already . 
 Whatever . Just make sure you go vote . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You don ’ t know what day the elections are ? 
 They ’ re this coming Tuesday . 
 Yes , I ’ m serious . 
 I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were . 
 You should watch the news more often . 
 I will . Will you be voting ? 
 You don ’ t know that ? 
 It ’ s this Tuesday . 
 Why would I joke ? 
 You should ’ Ve known already . 
 As long as you go vote , that ’ s all that matters . 
 I got a great look at him . 
 I can do that . 
 All right . 
 He's there . 
 He's number four . 
 I'm glad to help . 
 Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen . 
 I was there . 
 A man came into the bank with a gun . 
 I was so scared when I saw the gun . 
 He took the money and tried to get away . 
 He didn't even make it out the door . 
 I got a perfect look at the suspect . 
 That'll be easy . 
 Okay . 
 I see him . 
 The suspect is number four . 
 I'm happy to be of assistance . 
 I sure did . 
 I was in the bank at the time . 
 I saw the guy come in with a gun . 
 He was wearing a mask . 
 He came in alone . 
 That'll be fine . 
 Yes , I was , Officer . 
 I was there as it happened . 
 The robber came in with a gun . 
 He had a mask over his face . 
 He was alone . 
 I would be happy to . 
 Yes . I know exactly what he looks like . 
 That won't be a problem . 
 I am looking . 
 Yes . He's in the line-up . 
 Number four . 
 It was no problem at all . 
 I saw the whole thing happen . 
 I was in the bank during the robbery . 
 Some dude came into the bank with a gun . 
 When he pulled out the gun , I got so scared . 
 He got the money and tried to leave . 
 The cops arrested him before he could even make it out the door . 
 You have a warrant out for your arrest . 
 My computer shows that you have a bench warrant . 
 You apparently missed a court appearance . 
 There's nothing I can do about that . 
 That's life . 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . 
 You have a warrant . 
 Apparently , you have a bench warrant . 
 You missed a court appearance . 
 I don't know what to tell you . 
 Life isn't fair . 
 You have the right to remain silent . 
 Yes , I was . 
 I was in the bank at the time of the robbery . 
 I saw a man come in with a gun . 
 No . He had a mask on . 
 He was by himself . 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 I need to hire you . 
 I need you for my court date . 
 I ’ m being charged with a felony . 
 What is your price ? 
 I can ’ t afford that . 
 That ’ s expensive , but I need you . 
 There is a warrant out for your arrest . 
 You have a bench warrant . 
 Have you missed a court date ? 
 I can't help you . 
 A lot of things aren't fair . That's life . 
 You have the right to an attorney . 
 I ’ m in need of your services . 
 I have a court date coming up . 
 It ’ s the felony charge . 
 What ’ s your rate ? 
 That ’ s too high . 
 I ’ ll hire you anyway . 
 I need to report a break-in . 
 Last night . 
 It happened at my house . 
 I'm not sure yet . 
 My front window was busted . 
 Please hurry . 
 I am reporting a break-in . 
 It happened last night . 
 It happened at my house . 
 I don't know . 
 Someone busted my window . 
 Please do . 
 No . 
 I got robbed ! 
 Some guy on the street just mugged me . 
 No , he just stole all of my things . 
 I need to go to the police station . 
 That would be great . Thank you . 
 No , I'm not . 
 I was just robbed ! 
 Someone just robbed me . 
 He took all my things , but he didn't hurt me . 
 I need to make a statement at the police station . 
 Thanks . 
 Not at all . 
 Someone just robbed me . 
 This guy just robbed me right on the street . 
 I'm okay . He just stole my things . 
 I have to file a report at the police station . 
 I would like that . 
 I have no idea . 
 I was not aware of that . 
 You can't give me a break ? 
 How much is the ticket for ? 
 I have to go to court ? 
 Fine . Give me the ticket . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Really ? I'm sorry . I did not know that . 
 Why can't you just let me off with a warning ? 
 How much is the fine ? 
 I have to be at court ? 
 All right . Just give me the ticket . 
 No , sir . 
 I'm sorry . I did not know that . 
 Can't you give me a warning ? 
 How much will the fine be ? 
 I have to go to court over a brake light ? 
 Can I have the ticket , please ? 
 Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea . 
 I am pleading not guilty . 
 I am not the guilty party 
 I am not the person who committed that crime . 
 Will you let me go if I tell you ? 
 I have no problem singing like a canary . 
 I would like to make my plea . 
 I would like to plead not guilty . 
 I know . But I did not do it . 
 I didn ’ t commit the crime . 
 If I tell you who did , will you release me ? 
 I ’ ll tell you all you need to know . 
 I can ’ t believe it . 
 I plan on going back to school . 
 I ’ m not sure yet , but I plan to do good things . 
 I have no plans on being back . 
 That ’ s true . 
 I ’ m going to be fine . 
 That ’ s great . 
 I want to go back to school . 
 I haven ’ t decided yet . 
 I ’ m never coming back . 
 I realize that . 
 Thanks . Things are going to be different now . 
 I ’ m so excited . 
 I ’ m going back to college . 
 I haven ’ t thought about it yet . 
 You won ’ t see me here again . 
 I know . 
 Thanks . I know things are going to be better . 
 I am . 
 The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding . 
 I was not speeding . 
 In a 40 mph zone , I was only going about 35 . 
 Do I still need to pay the fine ? 
 I appreciate your understanding . 
 Yes . That is why I'm here . 
 I was pulled over for allegedly speeding . 
 To be honest , I really wasn't . 
 I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 . 
 What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ? 
 I'm so glad for your help . 
 Yes , I am , Your Honor . 
 Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding . 
 No , Your Honor , I was not . 
 I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone . 
 So , I don't have to pay the ticket ? 
 Thank you very much , Your Honor . 
 I need to file a complaint . 
 I got robbed . 
 It happened this morning . 
 My wallet and cell phone . 
 I sure did . 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 I would like to fight my ticket . 
 Yes , the officer is here today . 
 I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . 
 There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . 
 A picture of my license plate was never taken . 
 Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . 
 I need to fight this ticket that I got . 
 Yes , he is , Your Honor . 
 I was told by the officer that I ran a red light . That information isn't true . 
 I'm not sure , but the signal had a camera on it . 
 No , my picture wasn't taken . 
 Thank you very much , Your Honor . 
 I want to file a complaint . 
 A man robbed me today . 
 I was robbed this morning . 
 He took my phone and my wallet . 
 I saw him perfectly . 
 I could do that . 
 I would like to file a complaint . 
 I was robbed . 
 It happened this morning . 
 My wallet and my cell phone . 
 Yes , I was . 
 That would be easy . 
 They arrested me without probable cause . 
 They had no reason for arresting me . 
 Yes , the next morning . 
 Yes , they did . 
 I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for . 
 I want justice . 
 They arrested me for nothing . 
 They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . 
 They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . 
 They sure did . 
 I matched the description of a robbery suspect . 
 I want to take them to court . 
 I want to take them to court for arresting me . 
 There was no reason for them to arrest me . 
 They released me the next morning . 
 That ’ s exactly what they did . 
 They said I matched the description of a robber . 
 I ’ m definitely taking them to court . 
 Not yet . What happened ? 
 Yes , I heard the lights were out all night . 
 I don't understand . 
 They really started looting ? 
 Did the looters get caught ? 
 Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts . 
 I haven't had a chance to see it . 
 The lights were out everywhere . 
 They what ? 
 That's crazy . 
 Were the looters found ? 
 I hope this doesn't happen again . 
 No , I haven't . What's going on ? 
 Yes . The lights were out all night . 
 What do you mean ? 
 People went out and looted ? 
 Did the police find who did it ? 
 I hope we don't have any more blackouts . 
 I am ready to make my plea . 
 I plead not guilty . 
 I realize that , but I am not guilty . 
 I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed . 
 I ’ ll tell you if you let me go . 
 I am willing to tell you that information . 
 I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life . 
 Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions . 
 Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . 
 I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning . 
 Hmm . Thank you very much . 
 I certainly have . 
 About two hours ago . 
 I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . 
 I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . 
 I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . 
 Yes , I know . I regret it very much . 
 Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me . 
 I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces . 
 My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe . 
 No . They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark . Theran off then leaving me bound and gagged . It was some time before my wifereturned and released me . I phoned the police at o 

Do you believe in god ? 
 I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . 
 For example ? 
 Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 
 No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . 
 Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . 
 You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness 
 That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . 
 hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole 
 you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
 well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? 
 well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . 
 I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! 

How does the political system work in your country ? 
 Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? 
 What ’ s a cabinet ? 
 Can any mp make a law ? 
 I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . 
 How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? 

Hello . Gail Willows speaking . 
 Hello , Daniel . What can I do for you ?

 I've come in to give you the documents under the L / C we opened , the new one . This lot are from Singapore , a new customer . 
 Yes , with a fine toothed comb , as usual . Everything seems fine , except for one thing . The description of the items we are purchasing is a little different from what we expected . 
 Not really , perhaps just a translation problem , that's all . Anyway , we've agreed to accept it . 
 Yes please . I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff .

 Yes , it's not bad . I will need to see your passport though . 
 Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything . 
 So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? 

Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? 
 This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . 
 Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . 

Ah , Hello . So , you are back ? 
 That's good . Could I please see the originals of everything ? 
 You're pretty lucky actually , today is higher than yesterday . It's 824 . 71 RIB for 100 USD . 
 Yes . Please sign your name at the bottom of the Exchange Receipt . Thanks very much and here's your money . 
 Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ? 
 Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later . 
 Today I'm here to find out about paying in foreign currency . You do that here , I suppose ? 
 My nephew has told me about something called a ' timing deposit ' or something like that ? 
 Put me down for 2 years . Here's the money I'd like to pay in ... 
 Actually , Miao Ping , I'm here to close my account with you . I'm going home , the company is transferring me back to London . 
 Next week , so I thought it was better to get this all sorted out as soon as possible . 
 Here you are , Miao Ping . Don't laugh at the horrible photo today , OK ? 
 It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note . 
 No , I don't . Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given , but for some reason this one slipped through . 
 I understand . To be honest , I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake . 

Hello , how can I be of service ? 
 The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check . 
 Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated . 
 So , this 500 RIB is worthless ? 
 Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB . 
 Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ? 

Good morning , Madam . How can I be of service ? 
 Yes , I'm sorry about that . One of our Atms is down and we are waiting for it to be repaired , but it should be up and running again very soon . 
 You need to fill out the deposit slip as well . Here you go , Madam . 

Hi . I want to open an account with you , so I can pay my bills by direct debit . 
 Yes , that's what I thought . It's so much trouble coming down here or to the post office to pay all of my utility bills every month . So , what exactly do I need to do ? 
 Here you go . Is that it ? 
 Here . What's the least I can pay in to get this account open ? 
 OK , here you go . 

Good day . Is this the Business Centre ? 
 I want to make a deposit . 
 A Current Deposit , please . 
 Arm ... just the usual , Current Deposit please . 

Mr Jacobs ! Lovely to see you again ! What can I do for you today ? 
 What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ? 
 Great . Please fill them out on this deposit slip . 
 That's right . How much do you want to pay in ? 
 Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too . 

Hi , I was wondering how I'd go about getting a credit card . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid I don't . Is that necessary ? 
 That's done . Do you need to see any credentials ? 
 I don't have my passport on me at the moment . I'll just pop back to my office and pick it up . 

That's the transfer completed . Can I do anything else for you today ? 
 Could I have your Savings Book and the money , please . You are making a deposit of 800 RIB , is that correct ? 
 Please enter your PIN number on the keypad . 

Hello , how can I help you today ? 
 Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw . 
 On your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals , it won't cause a problem . Here's your money , 10,000 RIB . Please count it before you leave . 

Hello Mr Waterstone , what can I do for you today ? 
 Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew . 
 No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ? 
 Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note . 

IMPF Bank , Li Lan speaking , how may I help you ? 
 Hello , Mr Peng , how nice to hear from you again . What can I do for you today ? 
 I see . How much exactly ? 
 No , that's OK . I've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me . The money will be ready and waiting for you tomorrow . 

Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ? 
 The maturity date isn't for another 10 weeks . Are you aware of that ? 
 The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit , so unfortunately you will lose some interest . 

Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ? 
 I'm sorry Ms Reeve , it says 45,000 RIB here . 
 I'm sorry , we cannot make corrections on these . You'll have to bring another one with the correct amount , I'm afraid . 
 Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal . 
 Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ? 
 That's not a problem . I'll pop in later today to make a formal request . Thanks ! 
 Oh , hello , yes , arm ... I've just lost my bank stuff . 
 You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ... 
 Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ? 

Welcome to IBA Bank , how can we be of service ? 
 What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card . 
 I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything . 
 If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours . 
 Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? 
 What if I exceed ? 
 Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . 
 Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? 
 So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? 
 OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . 
 I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . 
 Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? 
 Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done . 
 No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . 
 That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . 
 Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . 
 No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it . 
 I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . 
 Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . 
 OK , it's 672910 . 
 Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . 
 Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? 
 Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . 
 Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? 
 And how do I withdraw if I need to ? 
 I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ? 

Good morning , Sir . 
 Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? 
 OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? 
 And how long are you depositing for ? 

Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ? 
 OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . 
 There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . 

Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , Mr Fang . Have you got your Certificate of Use of Foreign Exchange Account and the Foreign Exchange Account Opening Notice with you ? Our most widely used currencies are US dollar , Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar . 
 We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified . 

Morning , Madam . This is the window for Foreign Exchange Savings . How can I help you ? 
 That's fine . Is it a Time Deposit ? 
 Well , we offer 5 grades as standard 
 For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . 

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . How may we be of service ? 
 OK , do you have the relevant materials ? 
 Right . You have a choice of account , we provide USD , HAD , JOY and GAP accounts . Which do you want to go for ? 
 OK , I'll begin the opening procedure now and we'll let you know when everything is sorted . 
 Hello . I'm a Financial Manager in a local company and we'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account with you . 
 We have recently started doing a lot of business with British companies , so we'd like to open a GAP account . How should we go about this ? 
 That's great . Let's begin as soon as possible . 
 Hi there . I need to change some dollars into local currency . Can I do that here ? 
 Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ? 
 That sounds pretty good . OK , I'll change 500 USD today , thanks . 
 Yes , please . Can I exchange money here ? 
 To be honest , I really wanted to exchange my GAP , but I suppose USD will be fine . I have some and I just need a little local currency for expenses . Could you tell me what the rate is like today ? 
 OK , that sounds fine . I think 200 USD worth of RIB should be plenty , thanks . 
 Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency . 
 It's Traveller's Cheques , is that possible ? 
 Yes , right , certainly . Here you go . 
 Hello . I want to buy some RIB , is it OK to use US dollars ? 
 I think 250 dollars should be sufficient . 
 Oh , right , of course . Here you go . 
 It's correct . Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country ? 
 That's wonderful news , thanks for all your help . 
 Hello there . I need to buy some foreign currency for a business trip . How much can I exchange ? 
 OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now . 

Hi there , Mr Brown . Are you depositing or withdrawing today ? 
 I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ? 
 215,000 RIB is the exact balance . If you could just sign your name here . 

Good day , what can I do for you ? 
 Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ? 
 That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent . 

Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ? 
 With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . 
 Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? 
 Hello . I'd like to send 600 RIB in cash to my daughter . How long will it take for her to receive the money ? 
 Are there any extra charges , like commission ? 

Hello , you seem a little lost . Can I help you ? 
 I can do that for you . Could I see the Remittance slip ? 
 That's no problem . The amount is 2,000 RIB , is that correct ? 
 I just need to see some identification before I hand over the cash . 

Remittance Advice , how can I help you ? 
 That's no problem . There are 3 ways you can do this , firstly you can send the money account to account , or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual . Which service would you like ? 
 If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours . There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service . 

You're here to make a deposit , is that correct ? 
 No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ... 
 I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ? 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right . 
 I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ? 
 That's no problem . Could you please sign here ? Here's the 1,000 RIB in cash , your passport back , and the remaining balance has been deposited in your account . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB . 
 Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ? 
 Here you go . 

Hello there . Is there anything I can help you with ? 
 Which company are you from ? I'll check your details . 
 Ah , yes . Mr Can , isn't it ? Yes , the money has been transferred successfully . But you'll need to change it into RIB before you can have it . 
 You have an account with us , right ? If so , there shouldn't be any problem . 
 Is it possible for me to buy some RIB at this counter ? 
 That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . 
 Well , I'm only here for 3 days , so I think 500 GAP should be plenty . 

Hello . What can we do for you today ? 
 OK , could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared . We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ? 
 Mr Jurgen , yes , the remittance has been successful . 
 Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport . 
 I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them . 
 I see . You need the reference numbers ? For each cheque ? 

May I help you ? 
 That's no problem . Which currency would you like to buy ? 
 Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ? 
 Please fill in this form . How would you like it ? In 100 Euro cheques ? 

Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ? 
 We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know . 

Good morning . 
 Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ? 
 We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile . 
 As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . 

Hello . What can I do for you ? 
 I see . Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you ? I'll need your password for this transaction . 
 And how much of your salary would you like ? 

Let's sell our stocks now . 
 I have a feeling they're about to go down in a few days . 
 Recently it's been pretty good , actually . 
 Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . 
 I'm going to need a Deposit Certification , to handle the affairs related to home . 

Hi , can I assist you in any way ? 
 Oh , I see . In what area ? 
 Yes , we have this service . Have you got a deposit certificate and your passport ? I'm sorry to ask you , but your passport is very important . 
 Yes , I'm afraid there is . 
 Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today . 
 You mean , if there is any left over ? 
 Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? 

Hello , Sir . We haven't seen you for quite a while . So , what is it today that we can do for you ? 
 I see , yes , I can do that now . I'm sure you know , as I may have told you before , you should pay an extra 20 RIB handling fee for this service . 
 I can just take it from your account , you don't need to give me cash . 
 Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ? 

Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly . 
 Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T . 
 It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . 
 Hello . My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500 . She sent it yesterday , using the standard service . It's my birthday today , you see . 
 Yes . Here's my card . Do you need my ID ? 
 There you go . 
 Ms Ling ! It's Mr Gwent , from Montgomery Computers . 
 Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin . Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet ? 
 Deutsche Bank . It was 25,000 US dollars . 

Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? 
 Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
 That's not a problem . 
 Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . 
 I need to find a new way of getting my insurance . 
 Could you give me some details about that ? 
 That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! 
 I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks . 
 Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . 
 And I can purchase that here ? 

Hi there . How can I help ? 
 I see . And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us ? 
 Yes , that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook . That's what you need to get your salary . 
 I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . 
 I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? 
 That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ? 
 That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . 
 To be honest , I haven't really done much research . 
 Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice . 

Hello , Mr Brown . I'm glad you came in today ; we've just opened a new service that you might be interested in . It's called Bank Securities Link . 
 It's actually a Deposit Account that links to your Margin Account , the one you have with the Securities Company . You can transfer the money you have in your account into your Fund Account . 
 You can use your Deposit Book or your Credit Card . And of course , you can use our e-banking . 
 Right , here it is . 
 I'll take 4,500 RIB , please . 
 OK ... there we go . Thanks very much . 
 Hello , yes , can I do Bank-Insurance Link business here ? 
 Yes . Is that necessary ? 
 OK . Here's my account details . 
 Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ? 
 I'd like 20,000 RIB , please . If that's possible . 

Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? 
 Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . 
 Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . 
 Technically , yes . 

How can I help you today ? 
 Have you got some ID and your cash card ? 
 How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ? 
 The usual minimum purchase is 5,000 RIB . 

Good afternoon . Can I be of service ? 
 Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . 
 OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ? 
 No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . 
 Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund . 
 Regarding what exactly ? 

Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 OK , can I see the note and some ID , please ? 
 You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ? 
 Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . 
 You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters . 
 Well , we've just acquired a new business so we need to set up a lot of services with you . We are particularly interested in Agent Services . 

Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ? 
 The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . 
 I'm afraid so , yes . There is always some risk on the buyer's part . 
 I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ? 
 That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ? 
 Do you need any other documentation from me ? 

May I help you ? 
 Well . Can you tell me how much you have deposited ? 
 Please let me have your name and your savings account number if you remember it . 
 Don't worry , Mr . Brown . Let me try to check it for you . One moment , please . Yes , I have your account number here . The balance is exactly RIB 12,000 
 It's my pleasure . Please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account . 

Hi . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 If you could show me your details , please . What can I do ? 
 We can amend it for you as long as your customer agrees to the amendment . 
 That's fine . All you need to do is fill in this form and state the amendment . 
 Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ? 
 Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? 
 The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . 
 OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone . 
 Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan . 

I want to send some money to Nanchang . Is it handled here ? 
 I want to remit 1,200 yuan to my brother in Nanchang . 
 What's the difference ? 
 OK . I'll take T / T . 
 All right . Here it is . 
 Here you are . Thanks . 
 Bye-bye . 
 I need to increase the amount of my L / C . It's quite a new one ; I opened it 12 days ago . 
 How do I go about that ? 
 OK , you can take that from my account . I'll fill in the form now . 

Good afternoon , can I help you ? 
 I'm Kristy . Can I help ? 
 Oh , yes . Hello Mr Simons . I have some information about your L / C amendment . The negotiating bank has just informed us that the 3rd party does not wish to accept the amendment . 
 I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party , personally this time , and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with . Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement , which is viable for everyone . 
 Mr Edwards , this is Kristy calling from IBA . 
 Do you remember coming in to do the L / C amendment last week ? 
 The negotiating bank has just been in touch ... 
 No , Mr Edwards , not at all . We are contacting you to let you know that everything has gone smoothly and the amendment has been accepted . 

What else can I do for you today ? 
 We'll have our own Secure Internet Banking Service . What it is , is a sort of online financial service for enterprises and individuals , so you could get it . It's for doing all types of e-business . 
 Easy as pie ! We can get everything set up for you right away . Then , you'll be shopping securely online in no time at all . 
 Hello . I'm trying to track down some documents due to arrive any day on our new L / C . 
 It's TH 15699324873 0 . 
 Would it be possible to transfer them to IBA Bank ? 

Hello . May I help you ? 
 Let me find that on my screen ... yes , the L / C is right here . I'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet . 
 It should be around 5 working days , but different cases take different times . Sorry I can't be more precise . 
 Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ? 
 That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . 
 I'm here to pay my telephone bill . I usually go to the post office , but I was told that I could take care of it here . Is that right ? 
 I don't usually like to use Atms , I like dealing with a real person , you see . 

Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Now , you can do it via our Atms . It's convenient and easy to use . And we have 4 machines in this branch , so the queues are not usually very long . 
 You just simply follow the instructions on the screen . You can inquire about your account information and use the self-service payment function . 
 Hello , Lina . I'm calling about your new PIN scheme . I'm new to all of this , so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant ... 
 I see . How about buying and selling items ? 
 That's good to know , because I do travel quite frequently . 
 Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too . 
 I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . 

Hi , Sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Right . If the cheque is coming from the US , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear . 
 There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end . 
 I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ? 
 And how much is payable in each instalment ? 
 Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . 
 Yes , I would like to use the ATM to make a payment . But I need to pay 3 parties at once . 
 They are , yes . How should I do this ? 
 Yes , I've got that here ... 

Which type of telephone bill would you like to pay today ? 
 I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . 
 Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person ! 
 Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ? 
 Yes , I've got all that here . 
 A copy or the original ? I guess you need the original , right ? OK , I'll return shortly . 
 Let's go take a look at it . Do you have your ID with you ? 
 Okay , I see the problem . You forgot your code , didn't you ? 
 The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it . 
 Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank . 
 Hello , I'm sorry it's been such a long time . I've been away on business . I'd like to discount this . 
 Yeah , sure . Here they are . Take your time going through them , I'm in no hurry . 
 Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ? 

I would like to open a checking account at this branch . 
 I do , at a different location , I have a savings account and a CD . 
 Here is my driver's license . Will that work ? 
 Business please . And I want the most simple one you have . 

Hello , back already ? That was quick ! 
 Great . I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter , you can fill in one here . 
 Next time , you can get one from the counter over there . Or before you come in , you can download one from our website . It's really easy . 
 I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . 
 So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? 
 I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . 

Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ? 
 Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . 
 Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . 

What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? 
 All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . 
 Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? 
 Is there any flexibility on that ? 
 OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . 

Hello . I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ? 
 Yes , Sir . We can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , Temporary Working Capital Loans , Short-term Working Capital Loans and Mid-term Working Capital Loans . 
 Which one interests you , Sir ? 

Hello . What can we do for you ? 
 Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ? 
 Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... 

Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ? 
 Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc . 

Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ? 
 If you think it will be very short-term , I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan . Then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future . 

Mr Brown ! How nice to see you , can I help ? 
 I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch . 
 We will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class A , during that period . 

Hello . How can we be of service ? 
 OK , are you already an account holder ? 
 To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long-term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure ... 
 Yes , and then other qualitative factors , such as the transparency of your business operations , your credibility and the integrity of your management . 
 Yes , hello . Our company used your bank to send some documents to Malaysia last week . Could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet , please ? It's Sang Hung Enterprises , based in Kula Lump . 
 That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ? 

Hello , Fife Computers . How can I help ? 
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ? 
 What's the charge for that ? 
 That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks . 
 I need to get a Letter of Credit . Is this the right window ? 
 Yes , right here in my brief case . Just a moment , please . 
 That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account . 

Next , please . 
 Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange . 
 How much do you like to exchange ? 
 In what denominations ? 
 Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . 
 OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs . 
 Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . 

Good afternoon , Mr Meng ! It's nice to see you today . It's been a while , hasn't it ? 
 I envy you , Mr Meng ! What can I do for you today ? 
 Right . Do you have the code for that one ? 
 Here it is . Have you got the advice slip with you ? You have sufficient funds in the account , so we can go ahead . 
 Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . 
 If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . 
 You may withdraw the money at any time . You just need to present your deposit book . 
 OK . Do you have your ID card on you ? 
 Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment . 
 I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ? 
 I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now . 
 Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? 
 So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! 
 I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . 
 OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? 
 That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! 
 I'm having a little trouble with this form . 
 There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want . 
 So , I should choose that one ? 
 I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ? 

Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? 
 Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher . Could you tell me it's RIB deposit or currency deposit ? 
 Is it your first time to make a deposit here ? 
 The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ? 
 Fill in this slip in ink , please . 
 All right . Just a moment , please . 

Hello . What can I do for you today ? 
 Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ? 
 Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? 
 Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . 

Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 
 No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . 
 It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 . 
 Hi . I need some help with these documents under L / C . 
 Yes . My Manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . 
 Thank you . I need to get this done as soon as possible ; my manager is tearing his hair out ! 
 Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods . 
 Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ? 
 No , everything has to be perfect . 

Hello again . What can I do for you today ? 
 Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? 
 Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... 
 The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . 

Good morning , Mr Bell . How are you today ? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents ? 
 I see , here it says KM509 . 
 Yes , I see what you mean . You need to reject these documents . 
 You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived ? It's Ming Cha Legal Services . 
 Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 . 
 Correct . Could I convert that into RIB ? 
 That's fine , thanks . 
 I am indeed . What can you tell me ? 
 Do I get a card ? 
 How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . 
 That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? 
 That's wonderful . 
 I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? 
 I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? 
 What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? 

Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? 
 I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? 
 Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . 
 That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . 
 For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . 

Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ? 
 That's no trouble , Sir . 
 Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program . 
 For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both . 

Hello , Madam . What can we do for you today ? 
 I certainly do . Here it is , an Export L / C from Tokyo . 
 Yes , it is . Sayuri Beds , Tokyo , Japan . 
 Just sign right here , please . That's everything you need to do . 

Personal Finance Department , Lucie speaking , how may I help ? 
 That's no problem . What exactly would you like to know ?

Tina Li , Financial Planner , how may I be of service ? 
 It certainly is . You can do almost anything with it , anytime , anywhere . 
 All you need to do is sign up at any one of our branches and you can use the service right away . 
 It's a pleasure . Thanks for calling Lincoln Bank . 
 I set up the Personal Wealth Management Service with you , but I'm going to be travelling overseas . I'm not quite sure what I should do . I mean is it possible to still use the service ? 
 Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? 
 And they can deal with everything ? 
 That's good to know . Thanks . 
 I hope you can help me . I've been told about something called ' Financing Link ' ? 
 Could you tell me more ? 
 So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ? 
 This is just what I've been looking for . Sign me up right away , please . 
 I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C . 
 Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ? 
 Here you are . 
 No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye . 
 Hello , this is Miao Eng calling from Lincoln Bank . 
 No , not at all . I was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked , and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning . 
 Shall I go ahead and process them for you ? 

Welcome to the International Business Department . How can I help you ? 
 No problem , I can do that for you right now . Have you checked the documents ? 
 Of course , that's all part of the service . 
 Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ? 

Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ? 
 Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ? 
 Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving . 
 No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in . 
 Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . 
 I'm afraid so , yes . 
 Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . 
 I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . 

Hello , Mr Lawson . It's a pleasure to see you again . You seem to be in here all the time at the moment ! What can I do for you today ? 
 You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call . 

Good morning , Felix Wasserman Associates . Beth Jennings speaking . 
 Hello , Mr Hong . What can I do for you ? 
 That's great ! That was quick , after it not being there yesterday I wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while . 
 If you could , please . That would be wonderful , thanks . 
 I certainly am . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . By all means please do . Please take a seat . 

Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? 
 I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? 
 500 dollars , please . 
 OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . 

What can I do for you ? 
 You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . 
 OK . 

Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ? 
 Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ? 
 That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought . 
 That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James ! 

May I help you ? 
 Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange . 
 We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office . 
 The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars . 
 Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there . 

What else , Ma'am ? 
 Let me show you to the cashier's . It's 905 yuan in total . 
 Oh , it's a service charge . 
 Sorry , but we can't do that . It's store's rule . 
 Yes . 
 Here is the receipt . Wanna to have it wrapped , Ma'am ? 
 It'll be great to have you again . 

I'd like to open a one-year time deposit account and a checking account . 
 Okay , here are the forms . Can I use traveler's checks to open the account ? 
 Okay , here you are . 
 Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account . 
 OK ... Here you are . Any problem on that ? 
 Yes , I do . Here it is , and the cash . 
 Sure . 
 Yes . Can you tell me what the interest rate is now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes . I want to make a remittance to New Delhi . 
 I'd like a banker's draft please . It's not really urgent . 
 Hello , I want to remit one thousand Yuan to Magnolia Company . 
 OK ... Do I put on Magnolia Company for the receiver ? 
 OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ? 
 Here you are . What is the rate ? 
 OK , when will this remittance arrive ? 
 That's good . Is there anything else ? 
 Thanks , I will . 
 Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . 
 We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . 
 I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . 
 We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . 
 Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . 
 Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . 
 All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . 
 Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . 
 Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . 

Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . 
 It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . 
 Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . 
 The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . 
 I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . 
 We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . 
 To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . 
 Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . 
 Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . 
 I am not sure . What's the rate today ? 
 What was the rate yesterday ? 
 Oh , the rate goes down . 
 Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? 
 Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . 
 OK . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 I will think about it . 
 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . 
 I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . 
 Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . 
 All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . 
 We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . 
 The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . 
 Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . 
 I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . 
 Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . 
 Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . 
 I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . 
 Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 No . These terms need to be amplified . 
 Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . 
 Yes , that's very important . 
 We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . 
 I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . 
 But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . 
 There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . 

I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . 
 But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . 

I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . 
 Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . 
 Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? 
 Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? 

Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . 
 Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? 
 Wonderful . 
 In April or early May . 
 In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . 
 All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April . 
 How much would you like ? 
 A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . 
 Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . 
 All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . 
 Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . 

I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . 
 The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . 
 But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . 
 But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . 
 But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . 

What's your main range ? 
 I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . 
 Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . 
 I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . 
 What are they ? 
 That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? 
 We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . 

Welcome to China , Mr . White . 
 Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? 
 Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . 
 Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . 
 Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . 
 We normally export CFR . 
 That can be discussed . 
 What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel . 

What arrangement will you make about payment ? 
 At sight of course . 
 I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . 
 We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . 
 Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . 
 Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . 
 That's right . Let's go into the details . 
 Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? 
 Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . 
 As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . 
 I am sorry . 
 I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . 

The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . 
 Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 I agree with your proposal . 
 Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram . 
 It's FOB Shanghai . 
 Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? 

Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? 
 Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . 
 Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . 

What kind of document is an invoice ? 
 How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? 
 What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Yes , Dad ? 
 Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . 
 That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? 

How are your stocks doing , Jim ? 
 Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . 
 No . What happened ? 
 Oh , boy . His wife can't be happy about that . 
 Yes , I'd like to close my account . 
 Adam Smith .

 Next Friday . 
 14 May flower Ave , Los Angeles . 

Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea . I am thinking of placing an order with you . 
 I like both . Could you show me some samples ? 
 Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ? 
 I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi . 
 Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade . 
 Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? 
 My name is Jenny Clinton . 
 Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . 
 Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . 
 That would be very kind of you . 
 The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . 

Hello ! How can I help you , sir ?

Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? 
 Just a moment , please . Your name ? 
 Here is your balance . 
 Here you go , Miss . 

I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? 
 I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 What is the interest rate on your card ? 
 That's very expensive ! 
 How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? 
 Does the card provide any other benefits ? 

Hello , may I help you ? 
 Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . 
 Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . 
 No , madam . Not very much . 
 Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? 

Put on the helmet , please . 
 You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . 
 Well , not fully automated . 
 All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . 
 One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . 
 About 2 % in normal operations . 
 Yes . Shall we take a break now ? 
 It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . 
 In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . 
 Thank you . 
 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . 
 Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? 

It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . 
 Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . 
 The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . 
 Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . 
 Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . 
 Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . 
 Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . 
 So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . 
 I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . 
 Thank you . 
 That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? 
 No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . 
 I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . 
 No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . 
 Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . 
 Good . 
 Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . 
 Do you sell direct to shops ? 
 Do you keep a stock of these things ? 
 That is , your commission . 
 Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . 
 According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? 
 We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... 
 Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . 
 Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . 
 Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . 
 Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . 
 If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . 
 I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? 
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . 
 I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . 
 What is it ? 
 Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . 
 Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . 
 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? 

First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . 
 I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . 
 I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . 
 I'll come to that . My proposal is 
 Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? 
 You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . 
 Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . 
 We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . 
 Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . 
 No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . 
 Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . 
 Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . 
 I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . 
 We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? 
 The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . 
 When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . 
 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . 
 I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 

Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? 
 Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . 
 The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? 
 That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . 
 Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? 
 Good . Friday morning at 9 . 
 Yes , I would like to exchange some money . 
 I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? 
 Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? 
 I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! 
 Not too good , I'm sorry . 
 It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . 
 Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . 
 No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . 
 That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit . 
 I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . 
 Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? 
 Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? 
 Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . 
 We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? 
 I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . 
 I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . 
 Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . 
 Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? 

Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice . 
 So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? 
 Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . 
 Or a curse . 
 That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . 
 Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . 
 I could , but where's the fun in that ? 
 Than you , I'm not late , am I ? 
 Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . 
 Please , I wish you would . 
 Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . 
 That's pretty much what I heard . 
 No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . 
 Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? 
 Sure . No problem . 
 Sure . Do you have my number ? 
 No problem . I'll wait for your call . 
 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
 I have all the information in this folder . 
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . 

I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! 
 Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . 
 Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . 
 That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! 
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . 
 I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . 
 It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . 
 Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? 
 Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . 
 It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... 
 Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . 
 It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . 
 No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . 
 Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... 
 No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . 
 Great ! 
 Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . 
 Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . 
 No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? 
 But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . 

Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . 
 Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . 
 Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? 

That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . 
 I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . 
 What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? 
 Yes . 
 China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation 
 Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent 
 It depends on how much you order 
 I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . 
 Yes , it's the correct thing to do . 
 Even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable . 
 Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . 
 Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . 
 Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . 
 No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . 
 No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . 
 I think we'll get along fine . 
 We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . 
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . 
 I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . 
 Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? 
 Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? 
 Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? 
 Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon . 
 That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . 
 Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . 
 Carton ? 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . 
 All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . 
 That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . 
 No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? 
 Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . 
 Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . 
 Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . 
 That's fine too . 
 Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . 
 Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . 
 Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . 

To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . 
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 
 You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . 
 Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . 
 Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . 
 Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . 
 We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . 
 Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . 
 Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . 
 These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing 
 The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . 
 Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . 
 You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . 
 Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . 
 All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . 
 Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? 
 Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . 
 Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? 
 Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? 
 That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . 

I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . 
 The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . 
 Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . 
 I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . 
 Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . 

Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? 
 Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . 
 What about the outer packing ? 
 Cartons ? 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . 
 Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . 
 Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . 
 Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . 
 If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . 
 I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . 
 Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . 

Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? 
 Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? 
 That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . 
 Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . 
 Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . 
 That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . 
 But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . 

Well , that was an interesting documentary ! 
 Like what ? 
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 
 I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! 
 And that is ? 
 I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . 
 I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? 
 Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . 
 We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . 
 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . 
 You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! 
 Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? 
 I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . 
 Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . 
 It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . 
 If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . 
 We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . 
 That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that 
 First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . 
 No , Even a dollar is all right . Here's your passbook , sir , just sign your name on it . 
 It varies from time to time . At present it is 6 % . 
 By all means . But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . 
 Hello , yes , I ’ d like to open a bank account . 
 What features do they offer ? 
 I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . 
 No , that won ’ t be necessary . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars . 
 Yes . I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily . 
 How much is the service charge ? 
 Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ? 
 Anything else ? 

May I help you ? 
 Please fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw . 
 Your ID card , please . 
 Do you want large ones or small ones ? 
 Wait a minute , please ... Here's the cash . 
 Well , sir . According to today's exchange rate , every pound in cash is equivalent to 1.89 U . S . dollars . How much would you like to change ? 
 ... OK . And here's your money . 
 Goodbye . 
 Which account would you like to open ? 
 It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money . 
 Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan . 
 For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK . 
 Your ID , please . 
 Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please . 

Good coming , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Very good , sir . What kind would you like ? 
 Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account . 
 Would you fill out this form ? 
 All right . And here's your deposit book . 
 Goodbye . 
 I'd like to cash this check , please . 
 Yeah . Here's my identification card . 
 Actually , I want to buy some traveler's checks . 
 Twenties would be fine . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , can I cash my traveler's check here ? 
 What's the cashing rate ? 
 Oh , I see . How much it the service charge ? 
 Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each . 
 OK , there you are . 
 Oh , I forgot to bring it . It is in my hotel room . 
 Well , thanks . I will come again this afternoon , then . 
 Uh , yes . I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks . 
 One thousand U . S . dollars . 
 Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account . 
 Right . Here it is . 
 Mm . In hundreds , please . 
 First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . 
 No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it . 
 It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % . 
 By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . 
 I'd like to open an account . 
 Actually , I'd like to open one of each , if that's possible . 
 What are my choices ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Let me see , the buying rate is RIB 808 per $ 100 . How much would you like to change ? 
 Would you mind showing me your passport ? 
 Let me see . $ 200 makes RIB 1,616 . Here is the cash and exchange memo . Please check it . 

Okay , I want to change 22,000 . 
 Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . )

Hello , madam . Would you like to take a look at our products ? They are high-tech items . 
 Sure . Do you have a minute ? Why don't you have a seat and let me show you how to operate this item ? 
 You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella . 
 It only costs you 20 dollars for one . 

We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ? 
 Oh , that's good . 
 It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . 
 I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 

Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ? 
 Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . 
 It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ? 
 Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? 
 About a week . 
 Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . 
 Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . 
 You have to fill out this form , ma'am . 
 It's easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
 You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorize it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
 Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . 
 That's right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 

Hi . May I help you ? 
 1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro . 
 Sure . How much would you like to change ? 
 Very good . May I see your passport ? 
 How would you like your bills ? 

Hey , son , are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . 
 I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life . 
 You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? 
 A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal . 
 I'd like to open a new account . 
 Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 Yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? 
 That's very convenient . 
 Yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? 
 Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? 
 That's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? 
 Thank you very much .

 What's the current interest rate ? 

I'd like to open a current account . 
 Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ? 
 Yes . How much do you want ? 
 One dollar to five francs . Is that all right ? 
 Of course , we can .

 Not at all . 
 Certainly , sir . How much do you draw ?

Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ? 
 Don't you have any other identification ? 
 Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
 How do you want your money ? 
 All right . Please wait for a moment . 
 Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ? 
 We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor . 
 Good . He is a man of high standing . I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan . 
 Do you want small bills or large ? 
 Do you want anything else ? 

Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ? 
 Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ? 
 I plan to take the loan for 3 years . 
 What about the loan repayment ?

 He lost his kids ' college money day trading . 

Hey , daughter , let me ask you something . 
 Do you have life insurance ? 
 You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? 
 A $ 100,000 policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He ’ ll give you a good deal . 
 It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? 
 It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . 
 Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? 
 Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . 
 Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? 
 Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . 
 Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did . 
 did you get the position you wanted ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !

 Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . 
 In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ? 

During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . 
 If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? 
 Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? 

I'm calling today about a bill that I never received . 
 It was for my Master Card . 
 I haven't got it in the mail yet . 
 What am I supposed to do about my bill then ? 
 But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ? 
 Okay , thank you very much for your help . 

What are your terms of sale ? 
 My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . 
 Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . 

I haven't received my credit card bill yet . 
 My Master Card . 
 I never got it . 
 What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill ? 
 Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault ? 
 Thanks for everything . 

How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? 
 Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
 OK , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? 
 I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? 
 These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 
 I need to open a second account . 
 I need another savings account . 
 I sure do . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Transfer $ 100 . 
 That ’ s fine . Thank you . 
 Which credit card was the bill for ? 
 That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago . 
 My computer shows that it has already been mailed .

 You'll have to prove it was their error ; then you can get an extension . 
 You are very welcome . Have a good day . 
 Very well .

 I wrote the check out for way too much . 
 I wrote the check out for $ 150 . 
 I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 . 
 That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver . 
 I have a problem . 
 I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced . 
 I think so .

 I'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ? 
 We're going to investigate this claim . 
 You won't have to pay for anything . 
 I have a problem . 
 I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it . 
 I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up . 
 Will you be able to solve my problem ? 
 So , I don ’ t have to pay any of it ? 
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you very much . 
 I ’ m having a problem . 
 I apparently owe some fees , but I never got the bank statement .

 That ’ s fine . I appreciate your help . 
 What's the problem ? 
 What charge was made ? 
 You didn't make this purchase ?

 No . We'll take care of everything . 
 I want to know about fees . 
 Overdraft fees . 
 How much is the fee ? 
 That ’ s a small fee ? 
 You would think it would , but it most likely won ’ t . 
 That ’ s it for today . Thank you . 
 I ’ m great . Thanks . 
 I need to know if I have any fees to pay . 
 How much do I owe ? 
 That ’ s crazy ! 
 Can I do that right now ?

 Tell me about fees . 
 I want to know about overdraft fees .

 What ’ s the problem ? 
 It was ? 
 That ’ s my only one . 
 No cash today . 
 I ’ ll come tomorrow with cash . 
 Is there a problem ? 
 What are you talking about ? 
 I can show you how to use it . 
 You need to push your card into the machine . 
 Enter your PIN . 
 Every option you can choose will appear on the screen . That ’ s about it . 
 Take my VISA . 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 That can ’ t be right ! 
 I don ’ t have another one . 
 I didn ’ t bring cash with me today . 
 I ’ ll come back for them tomorrow . 
 Put it on my VISA . 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 You ’ re kidding me ! 
 I only have one card . 
 I don ’ t have any cash on me . 
 I ’ ll be back tomorrow . 
 So , why don ’ t you ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 I can help you with that . 
 Just put your card into the machine . 
 Then you need to type in your PIN . 
 Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it . 
 What ’ s stopping you ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 I can help you figure it out . 
 Slide your card into the machine . 
 You need to type your PIN in . 
 Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done . 
 I need to cancel one of my accounts . 
 I don ’ t need it anymore . 
 Just transfer it over to my remaining account . 
 That would be great . 
 Not today . 
 That ’ s fine . Take your time . 
 I would like to cancel one of my accounts . 
 I only need one . 
 Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account ? 
 I appreciate it . 
 That ’ s all for today . 
 I greatly appreciate your help . 
 Do you have any form of ID ? 
 I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license . 
 OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service 

Which services offered by your band do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . 
 That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . 
 I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . 
 Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ? 

So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? 
 Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . 
 You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . 
 The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . 
 Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot 

I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please . 
 How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ? 
 Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty ! 
 Yes I do; here is my account number . 
 3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ’ s , please . 

I would like to withdraw my money and close my account please . 
 Here you are . 
 I will be leaving the city soon so I have no need for this account . 
 No problem . I ’ ll wait over there . 
 No , thanks . Coffee makes me wired and I will be nervous enough carrying all that cash . 
 Good morning , sir . 
 Right here , how can i help you today , sir ? 
 Do you have an account this bank , sir ? 
 May i please see ID ? 
 Today's rate is 2.57 Singapore dollars for 1 US dollar , here is your money , sir.Please count it and sign your name here . 
 You can cash them here , how much do you want to cash ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Thank you , have a good day . 
 It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . 
 Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . 
 Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . 
 Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . 
 Not in a million years ! 
 Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . 
 Currencies . 
 It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! 
 You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! 
 Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ 

Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . 
 Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! 
 There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . 
 I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . 

are you ready to go to the bank ? 
 there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM . 
 that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . 
 I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . 

Well , that was an interesting documentary ! 
 Like what ? 
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 
 I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! 
 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
 I have all the information in this folder . 
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . 

Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . 
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . 

Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... 
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... 
 Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! 
 No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! 

I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? 
 That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? 
 Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? 
 So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might 
 I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . 
 Our product features inventory tracking software , which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis . 
 Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar . 
 Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs . 
 Our terms are net 30 . 
 You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible . 
 An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . 
 Yes , sir.how can I help you ? 
 You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens . 
 One moment , please , and I will connect your call . 
 what ’ s wrong , Jim ? 
 Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? 
 Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? 
 Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? 

Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ? 
 It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . 
 What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again . 

I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? 
 And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? 
 Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? 
 That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . 
 So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . 
 You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . 
 In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . 
 Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . 
 And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . 
 I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . 
 You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . 
 Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . 
 Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents . 
 Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok . 
 You can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars . 

You won't believe what just happened . 
 I went down to change some money , right ? 
 I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . 
 Not today . 
 I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . 
 Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . 
 I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . 
 So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . 

I ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account . 
 Sure ? 
 That ’ s right . 
 That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . 
 Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t 
 Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . 

Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? 
 And do you have any questions ? 
 No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . 
 I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? 
 I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . 
 Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . 
 Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . 
 What would you like to know ? 
 Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . 
 Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . 
 That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . 
 Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . 
 I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . 
 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? 
 I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . 
 Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? 
 Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . 
 Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport . 
 How would you like it ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Yes . How much do you want ? 
 One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ? 
 Of course we can . 
 10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 Not at all . 
 Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . 
 At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . 
 Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . 
 Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . 
 How much would you like to borrow ? 
 Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems . 
 Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ? 
 Yes , furthering my education is already bringing about positive results in my workplace as it has boosted my confidence.As well the tutoring system my school employs offers courses uniquely suite 
 As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . 
 They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . 
 We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . 
 We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . 
 Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . 
 Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID Please . 
 Oh . Current account don ’ t pay our interest . 
 It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . 

Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . 
 Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . 
 A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs 
 A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . 
 What are you basing this information on ? 
 Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . 
 Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately . 
 I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . 
 Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . 
 That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? 
 That would be very good of you , Mr . White . 
 I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . 
 And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . 
 My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . 
 I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . 
 Does this title come with an increase in salary ? 
 Can you give me the specifics ? 
 That sounds fair . 
 Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . 
 She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with . 
 She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . 
 Is there anything wrong ? 
 It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? 
 Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . 
 I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . 

good morning . How can I help you ? 
 have you filled out an application form ? 
 yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? 
 yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . 
 it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? 
 the maximum is $ 1000 . 
 yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . 
 they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . 
 you're welcome . 
 Yes . 
 Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . 
 Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . 
 That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . 
 Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . 
 Are you going to make an offer today ? 
 Ok , I'll get this rate right away .

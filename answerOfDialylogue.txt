 I'll throw out the garbage . 
 Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . 
 What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 

Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? 
 Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . 

Would you mind waiting a while ? 
 I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . 

Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . 
 The pleasure is mine . 
 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . 
 Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . 
 I am wiped out . Thank you . 
 Never ! But thank you for inviting me . 

Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ? 
 Certainly . How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps . 

Can you manage chopsticks ? 
 Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? 
 What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . 
 Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . 
 I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . 
 Okay , let's go home . 
 No , we don't . 
 Six , including two kids . 

What kind of food do you like ? 
 But your American ? 

Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? 
 Would you care for a drink before you order ? 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? 

Can I help you sir , what do you need ? 
 Of course sir , no problem . 

Could I have my bill , please ? 
 I'm afraid there's been a mistake . 
 I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here . 

May I sit here ? 

Is everything to your satisfaction ? 
 Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . 

I'm looking for a white purse as a gift . Could you show what you have in stock ? 
 They must be popular again this season . 
 Wow . this is nice . I'll take this one . I guess if she doesn't like it she can return it , right ? 

Dahua's Market . How can I help you ? 
 We are on Nanjing Road , next to the theatre . 

Farmer's Pet Store . 
 Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank . 

May I help you find something , sir ? 
 We have all shapes , sizes , qualities and price ranges , do you know about the four Cs of picking a diamond ? 
 You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted . 
 You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . 
 That would be great . Thanks ! 
 Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , we charge 50 cents for water . 
 Sure . Do you need anything else ? 
 I'll put all that into the bag for you . 
 No , there is no charge for those . 
 Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left . 
 Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow . 
 I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? 
 That would be my pleasure . I'll wrap the perfume up in the gift box for you too . 
 Can you send a cab to pick me up ? 
 I'm on the corner of the Fifth and Mane . 
 I understand . 
 Some days are just like that . 
 There is about a 15 - minute wait . 
 OK . Give me your address . 
 He's on the other line , can you hold for a minute ? 
 He'll be right with you . 
 Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ? 
 OK , I ’ ll be right back . 
 Speaking . 
 Just about . 
 By all means . (= Of course . ) 
 Shame on you ! 
 Right away , sir . 
 Yes , sir , it is . 
 Please come again . 
 Yes , we are . Could we have the check please ? 
 Do you accept checks ? 
 Well , I don't have any cash with me , I'll have to put it on a credit . 
 Yes , we do , thank you . 
 Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ? 
 In that case , I might have just the pair for you . Look at these , they were made in Italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . You can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made . 
 Yes , we do , we also have this same style in dark blue and red . 
 Let me go to the back and get them . I'll be right back . 
 I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story . 
 I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending . 
 Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before . 
 Then I doubt if you like operas at all . 
 OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave . 
 Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings . 
 And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing ! 
 Exactly . 
 Just Mr . White . 
 He wouldn't say over the phone . 
 Okay . I'll just be a minute . 
 Yes , your wife and your dentist called . 
 You're welcome ! 
 Well , I'm looking for some winter clothes . And I notice you have pre-season sale on all your winter apparel . 
 Do you have any skirt that will go with this sweater ? 
 I don't think that shade of green will go with my complexion . Do you have any of those skirts in black or tan ? 
 Oh , yes . Just show me where the fitting rooms are now . I can't wait to try this on . 
 Give me six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fries , and a large coke . 
 That's fine . 
 Here's 20 . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , it is . What about it ? 
 I see . 
 Where did you hit it ? 
 Oh , Yes , I see it now . 
 Let's take a cab . 
 That's all right . 
 Fine , and you ? 
 Andrew , this is Linda Chen . 
 I need to set up an appointment to get my hair fixed . 
 Tuesday morning . 
 Are you nuts ? 
 What's it like ? 
 Who are the bad guys ? 
 Wow ! Where's the treasure ? 
 How do you find it ? 
 Great ! 
 What's it like ? 
 And then ? 
 That's neat ! 
 Yes ? 
 All right . But tell him I will only be here until four o'clock . 
 I'm sorry , that's bad luck . 
 Yes . 
 That will be fine . 
 Don't get drunk . 
 Better late than never . 
 Let me run and check . 
 Yes , Mr . Smith ? 
 No , it will be another hour . 
 I can help you with that . Do you still have your receipt ? 
 Oh , yes , that will help me a lot . 
 I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ? 
 Well , your refund total is 50 dollars . 
 Do you have the ' The man and the Sea ' by Ernest Hemingway ? 
 Can you hold it for me ? 
 I would be happy to . Did you find everything you needed ? 
 The total is 200 dollars . Would you like to put that on Sears card ? 

Benter's Books . 
 We have several hundred in stock . 

I'm a little rushed . Is there any quicker way to get there ? 
 How much will that run me ? 
 Do the drivers speak English ? 
 Are they safe ? 

Excuse me.Could you please tell me where the train station is ? 

Diana's Flowers , Diana Lin's office , may I help you ? 
 No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ? 
 Ok , I'll make sure she gets the message . 
 Pork chops . 
 What's your address , sir ? 
 Ok , someone will be there by 12:15 . 
 It's 2 dollars initially and 35 cents for each quarter mile . 
 No , I'll send a larger vehicle to pick you up . 
 I'll give it a try . 
 I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little . 
 No , don't bother . I think I'm OK . 
 Yes , it's OK . 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 Get in and close the door . 
 Sorry . The road is too crowded . 
 But I can't help it . 
 Sorry . We mustn't stop here . 
 Who ? 
 You must have the wrong number . 

I passed all the tests , Mom . 

May I please speak to Robert ? 
 Is this 2517758 ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 

Is Tom in ? 
 Isn't this Li's residence ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 Good idea . 
 Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay . 
 It's $ 4.25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22.5 . 
 I'll need to see your ID please . 
 Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old . 
 What's the matter ? 
 No , can I take a message ? 
 All right . 
 That's not fair ! 
 Tom has gone to lunch . 
 Do you want me to have him give you a call ? 
 He should be back in about forty minutes . 
 No , he's not . May I take a message ? 
 Yes , what's your name ? 
 That's all right . 
 We can take a bus there . 
 I think so . 
 No , it's too crowded . 
 Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! 
 We got on the wrong bus . 
 Robert is not available at the moment . 
 Around 3:30 . 
 Where did you See then last ? 
 Mrs . Smith has not checked in yet . 
 Yes , I'll see that she get the message when she checks in . 
 He's with someone right now , would you hold ? 
 Let me see . It depends . 
 If you are in a hurry , you should take a taxi . 
 Yes , very . Believe it or not , it will cost you more than one hundred dollars . 
 Take a bus then . It will only cost you 5 dollars . 

This is how you turn on the computer . 

May I speak to Marry Lin please ? 
 When will she be back ? 

Let's go ! 

I'd like to talk to Mr . White please ? 
 When is a good time to catch him ? 

You stepped on my foot ! 

Somebody , please answer the phone . 

Is Tom in ? 
 May I have his office phone number please ? 

Do you mind if I smoke ? 

Where are you going ? 

Jessie , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t come back home for dinner tonight . 
 I ’ m sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . 
 I apologize . You have my word , I ’ ll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise . 
 Thank you for understanding . I promise I ’ ll make it up to you . 
 Watch your language . 
 Forgive you for what ? 
 No ! Are you kidding me ? 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . 
 Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! 
 Good , let's go for a drive . 
 Great . 
 Sure , just ask . What can I do for you ? 
 No sweat . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Absolutely . I ’ m a great mechanic . 
 Anytime . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 It was hard work . 
 It took three of us to move it . 
 What time did he come in last night ? 
 Who was he out with ? 
 Give me a sec . 
 I don't care . 
 It really depends on you . 
 If I were you , I'd buy . 
 But mum , we're watching this movie . 
 Just 10 more minutes . 
 Rice . 
 Because it's supposed to be good for you . 
 I went first last time . 
 Oh , Okay . 
 Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco . 
 Okay , but you ask him . 
 Don't go to too much trouble . 
 That's the best there is . 
 That'll be $ 200 , sir . 
 Thanks very much . 
 I know , but there was nobody else . 
 Why not ? 
 It's raining cats and dogs . 
 I'm going to work . 
 Around 6 o'clock . 
 Played poker with my work friends . 
 Of course . 
 But it's raining . 
 Once in a while . 
 I'll go take a shower . 
 Okay ! I'll do the dishes . 
 Hello . Can you help me ? 
 Oh good , come in , please . 
 It's about time . 
 Of course , sir , I'll have a look in the back . 
 I'm afraid I haven't got one in your size . 
 Just a minute . 
 I've already started . 
 This afternoon . 
 You mean the large one or the small one ? 
 They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars . 
 No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? 
 Very well . Just take your time . 
 I'm off today . 
 Is that why you didn't return my call ? 
 That's okay . 
 No . 
 Sure , what's happened ? 
 It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood . 
 No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago . 
 Certainly , you're welcome anytime . 
 ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now . 
 Yes . 
 Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice ! 
 Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ? 
 OK . 
 Of course , what's the problem ? 
 Sure thing . 
 Did I ? 
 I take it you've done this before ? 
 Good . 
 I'd rather have a cup of coffee . 
 Yes , please . Milk and two sugar . 
 Pass him . 
 I was worried where you were . 
 Yes , you should have . 
 Yes , I've got to work overtime . 
 So what is it ? 
 Another tough thing , I guess . 
 I'll be back late tonight . 
 I have a meeting with my General Manager . 
 I ’ d love to , but I ’ m a terrible dancer . I ’ m afraid I may step on your toes . 
 Thank you . I ’ ll try my best . 
 Don ’ t worry about it . I have his pager number right here . 
 Forget it . It ’ s nothing . 
 It's delicious . 
 Okay . Say when . 
 No , thanks . I'm fine . 
 I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment . 
 I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Ok . Does he know your number ? 
 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . 
 It's good to be home . 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 How long have you got ? 
 Okay , I'll make you some food . 
 Marry is not in right now , she went shopping with her mum . 
 That's all right . We don't go to bed early . 
 Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . 
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 I can't believe it 。 
 I'm going to the hospital . 
 About how much will it cost ? 
 By the way , what's the time ? 
 It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ? 

I broke Mom's vase . 

Who broke my chair ? 

Man ! That car almost hit me ! 

Where can I get a good novel ? 

The washing machine isn't working again . 

I'll treat you dinner . 

Where did this come from ? 

Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . 
 Thank you so much . 
 What ? 
 I ’ m sorry ? ! 
 I don ’ t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old . 
 Get in . 
 Here's ten . Keep the change . 
 Let me have a look . 
 I like the fabric , but I don ’ t like the style . 
 They are too bright . 
 What time does the next showing of Forrest Gump begin ? 
 What about the one after that ? 
 Yes . We have socks made of various materials . These socks are of imported wool . 
 Yes , absolutely . 
 Here . We have black , white and transparent panty-hose here . 
 They will be ready in about half an hour . Do you need anything else ? 
 It's going to be 3 dollars 40 cents . 
 Yes , sir . Where to ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ? 
 But I don't speak English at all . 
 Really ? When is it on ? 
 Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that . 
 Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it . 
 So we should take the advantage of it . 
 Yes . Let me get you a pair . 
 Sorry . I'll clean it up . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , good . 
 I prefer TV play to football . 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting . 
 Sure . Let me get it for you . 
 No problem . This one is made of pure gold . 
 You ’ re right . This one costs less , but is more beautiful . 
 No , we guarantee the quality . 
 Certainly , the mirror is right here . 
 No . Go to bed right now . 
 Who's calling ? 
 Don't you like it ? 
 I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . 
 Well , I'd rather see a movie . 
 ' Star war ' . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
 News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . 
 Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . 
 Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
 Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . 
 Yes , 50 Yuan per month . 
 Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . 
 That's the point . 
 Dad , it's raining outside . 
 All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . 

Peter , enough with your computer games . Go do your homework now . 
 No ! Stop playing computer games ! 
 Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week . 
 I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? 
 I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . 
 Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . 
 What's on today ? 
 Really ? I'm interested in it . 

Peter , where are you going ? 
 Won't you watch TV ? 
 The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . 
 The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . 
 Who do you think will win ? 
 I think so . 
 Help yourself . 
 He is out . 
 Wow ! That car almost hit me . 
 No , thanks . I'm on a diet . 
 What's the rush ? 
 Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! 
 Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . 
 Sorry , I can't sing the song . 
 OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . 
 OK . 
 Wait a moment , mom . 
 Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . 

Sorry , I'm late . 

Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? 
 It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? 
 I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? 
 Do I have to change ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Mom , can I have more allowance ? 
 I want to buy more books . 
 Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . 

Two burgers , please . 

Dad , may I have a room of my own ? 
 Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . 
 Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . 
 It is difficult . 
 Do I have to memorize it ? 

Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . 
 Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . 
 Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . 
 Oh , honey , you made a mistake . 
 OK . Let's do it together . 
 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . 

How was your test ? 
 Oh , honey , you should study harder . 
 Don't worry . You'll do better next time . 
 Sorry . You've got the wrong number . 
 Sword , say it ' sword ' . 
 Look it up in the dictionary . 
 No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . 
 I like red . 
 Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? 

Mom , my nose is bleeding . 
 No , mom . I didn't . 
 Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . 
 Leave it to me . I'll fix it . 
 Are you sick ? 
 Let me take your temperature . 
 Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . 
 Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . 
 I like playing the piano . 

Where are you off to ? 

May I have the menu , please ? 

Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? 
 Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . 
 OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . 

Jenny , Can you come and help me ? 
 It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? 
 That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . 
 Curry and rice . What do you think ? 
 Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . 
 Honey , just turn down the stove . 
 No , it's too loud in here . 
 OK . I'm coming . 
 Thank you . You are so considerate . 
 OK . This key is too high for me . 
 OK . Let me have a try ... 
 Thank you . I'm sure you will . 

Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! 

Have you got a minute ? 

Who is the next one ? 
 Give the mike to him . 
 Be quiet . He is singing . 
 So did I . 
 Yes , he sings wonderfully . 
 Here . Catch ! 
 Yes , I do it quite often . 
 Simple , it's fun . 
 Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . 
 But I like the feeling . 
 I like popular music best . 
 Who is your favorite singer ? 
 Do you know this song ? 
 Let's sing it together , shall we ? 

Who's it for ? 

How much does this cost ? 

May I use your phone ? 

Where's the toilet ? 

Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars . 
 Did you get hit ? 
 Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? 
 Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . 
 Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . 
 Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . 
 Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . 
 Ten more minutes , mom . Please ! 
 I bet she will hang around with her mates after school . 

Don't tell me you're pregnant again . 

I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? 
 Do you know how to get the bank account ? 
 So easy . 
 My shopping life will be more convenient . 
 Dad , I have to do my homework . 
 Dad , I don't want to talk about it now . 
 I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . 
 Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . 
 It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . 
 And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . 
 Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . 

Stop burping . 

Can you give me a hand ? 

Let's go now . 

Kate , can we change the channel ? 
 This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . 
 What about this one ? Do you like this program ? 
 Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . 
 No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . 

Mom , can I watch TV ? 
 Alright , Mom . Should I turn off the TV right now ? 
 Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it . 

OK , Tom . It's your turn . Are you ready ? 
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! 
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' . 

Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? 

Peter , have you seen my purse ? 
 That's strange . It should be on the desk . 
 Not yet . Let me see . 
 I'm sorry . He's not in right now . 
 He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ? 

I received an E-mail from mother today . 
 She missed us and asked when we would go back home . 
 I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet . 
 All right . 
 Sure , I planted them . They're organic . 
 Well , it's a secret . 
 Well , honey , I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn . 
 It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . 
 Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . 
 Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . 
 Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . 
 What do we have for the dinner now ? 
 Do you feed rabbits ? 
 Where is my favorite white bread ? Is it in refrigerator ? 
 Do you prepare some dessert for me ? 
 Are you trying to change our eating patterns ? 
 Take a guess . 
 Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also . 
 Honey , you know , we don't have enough room for a pet dog . 
 No , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . I'm sorry . 
 I don't know yet . What's your idea , Dad ? 
 Dad ! It's cold now ! 

Dad , I've finished my homework . 
 Do you want to play poker ? 
 I'll teach you . 

I would like to buy a black suit . 
 No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony . 
 but it looks good . Let me try it on . 

Are you being served , madam ? 
 Yes , what size is in your mind ? 
 Any particular brand ? 
 How about this one ? It ’ s the latest design , simple but elegant . 
 $ 100 . 
 How much would you say ? 

can I see these silk ties ? 
 I ’ ll take this one . 
 No , thank you . I want to have a look at that scarf . 
 Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it . 
 No , I ’ d like to know something about contact lenses . 
 I have found I ’ m short-sighted recently . I need to wear glasses . As a student , it ’ s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses . 
 I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me . 
 They fit me very well . I like them . 

May I help you , madam ? 
 Yes . Your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be 
 Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service . 

Do you carrying fresh fish ? 
 I already looked , but did not see anything . 
 Thanks . 
 Oh , gosh . I didn't see it . 

Could you show me some scarves ? 
 Show me some of the latest fashion , please . 
 Yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce . 
 Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ? 
 But that still sounds expensive . 

Where's the nearest bank ? 

Thanks for your help . 

Hey , how are you doing ? 
 Sure , whatever you need . 

Could you do me a favor ? 

I like these shoes . 
 Really ? 

What would you like to eat tonight ? 
 Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ? 

I'm going to paint the house today . 
 Maybe not . Could you buy some while you're out ? 

How do you like Chinese food ? 
 What other kind of food do you like ? 

Hi , Bob . 
 Passed . 

What's on TV tonight ? 

My goodness ! My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ? 
 It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ? 
 That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you . 

Good morning , Mary . 
 Sunny side up , please . 

Can I give you a hand ? 

Good morning , Miss . 
 On the left of the elevator of the 3rd floor . 
 I ’ m sure you can find your favorite there . 
 It ’ s my honor . 
 I ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater . 
 It feels good . Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color ? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar . 
 Size one . By the way , what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn ’ t like it ? 
 All right . Could I have it gift-wrapped , please ? 

Do you like reading magazines ? 
 Why ? 
 No , you can learn a lot from them . 
 Absolutely . And it's a good way to kill time during the tour . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Yes , it is . It has some really good articles in it . 
 I didn't know that . How much does it cost to subscribe ? 
 I used to subscribe to it , but I cancelled my subscription last year . 
 I was the only person in my family reading it . Everyone in my family just likes to read Fashion . 

Please give me a piece of ' New York Daily ' . 
 Really ? Is there ' Wall Street Journal ' , please ? 
 I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine . 
 Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' . 
 Here you are . 

Do you have something to read ? 
 Could you lend me one ? 
 Thanks . It's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ? 
 Do you know the news ? 
 Brazil wins the World Cup . 

Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 No problem . No matter what ’ s wrong with it , I can surely meet your satisfaction . 
 Oh , here . I ’ m afraid it ’ ll be difficult to repair . 
 Yes , I can . To tell you the truth , I ’ m the best nearby . 
 What ’ s the matter with them ? 
 Ah , I can do it perfectly . 
 6 yuan . And I can make them as new as before . 
 All right . I ’ ll repair them for you . 
 Yes . They will be ready in a few minutes . 

Where's the nearest tailor's ? 
 The jacket is tight in the shoulders and long in the sleeve . What about the price there ? 
 Is there a better tailor's around here ? 

What can I offer you here ? 
 Ok . Please go ahead . 
 Oh , we are skillful in doing that . You can trust us . Our shop has a history of more than 20 years . 
 Yes , absolutely ! We have a very good reputation in the neighborhood . 
 If you like you can wait here . They will be ready in one hour and a half . 

Would you show me some table-cloths ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That ’ s reasonable . 
 Really ? I ’ ll take it then . 
 Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? 
 It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? 
 What about the performance itself ? 
 Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . 
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? 
 Two for the front . One last thing , are there any English subtitles for the show ? 
 Terrific . May I stop by to get that two tickets tomorrow afternoon ? 
 B . S-H-I-R-L-E-Y . 

Can I have the menu , please ? 

Would you show me some table-cloths ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That ’ s reasonable . 
 Really ? I ’ ll take it then . 
 There you go . 
 Yeah sure , it's much quicker . Do you know how ? 
 Ok , not a problem . Let's go to the station . 
 Yeah . 
 Where is that ? 
 Oh , that's simple enough . 
 Anything else I should know ? 

Have you got change for a thousand ? 

Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ? 
 Oh OK , where do I get off ? 
 Ok , thanks ... 
 No , is it difficult ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Wow , I can't thank you enough . 

What can I do for you ? 
 When do you need them , sir ? 
 No problem . Do you want 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 ? 
 And do you want the glossy or matted finish ? 
 You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film . 

Do you develop films here ? 
 Well , the 4 x 6 is fine . 
 The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color . 
 I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ? 
 Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible . 
 Yes , a roll of Kodak film please . 

May I help you , madam ? 
 Follow me , please . Here it is . What do you want ? 
 OK . Wait a second , please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Anything else ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ? 
 I see , sir . This one is very good . 
 You may rest assured . It sells well . 
 Certainly . Here it is . 
 Oh , Dad . Do I have to get up right now ? 
 Why didn't my alarm go off today ? 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 OK . I know . 
 Oh , that hurts . 

Are you going grocery shopping today ? 
 Yes , please get some white bread , thick cut , some ham , not the processed stuff , some gouda cheese , some galla apples and . . . 

I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . 
 Would you like to get in shape together ? 
 How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . 
 As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now . 

Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! 
 You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . 
 Does it bite or scratch ? 
 Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . 

Mom . I have to go school shopping . There's only one more week left . 
 I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough . 
 Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ? 

We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . 
 Some high speed chase scene , I think . 
 I think that they get a pretty good payoff . 
 I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! 

May I help you , sir ? 
 All right . What is your type of skin ? 
 You can use this . It has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . It has this lotion , as a gift attached . 
 How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf . 
 Yes , it is a new brand . 
 Anything else ? 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Use , I want a eye-shadow . 
 Purple . But today , I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour . 
 May I have a try ? 
 It's still too dark . Any brighter colours ? 
 What about other brands ? 
 Oh , that's the very thing I need . 
 Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . 
 I did , Mom . 

Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ? 
 I see . What does that include ? 
 What sort of response time do you guarantee ? 
 Are there any exclusions ? 

I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang . 
 If you need any help , just let me know . 
 What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! 
 You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . 
 Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? 
 It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . 
 Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school ! 
 Dad , I never eat breakfast . 
 Uh ! Dad ! 
 Alright . You win . Please pass the brain food . 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . 
 I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! 
 Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . 
 I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! 
 You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . 

Can you help me out , Chuck ? 
 I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . 

It's time to go . Are you ready ? 

How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . 
 I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? 
 I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . 
 All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . 

Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? 
 Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . 
 Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? 
 Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! 

Hello . Welcome ! 
 This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here . Do you want a full service ? 
 But the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now . 
 OK . Please sit down . I hope you will be satisfied with our service . 

You have a lovely house , Jack . 
 That's too bad . What problems are you having . 
 I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? 
 Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . 
 No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though . 
 It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . 
 I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up . 
 Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down . 
 Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . 
 Ok . 
 Uh , yes , they are . 
 What ? 
 Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience . 
 Mike , don't even think about it ! 
 I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous . 
 I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming . 
 You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts . 
 Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea . 
 Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? 
 That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . 
 With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . 
 And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . 
 I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? 
 It's too expensive . 
 What's the difference between the two ? 
 Let me see . 
 It costs only 25 yuan . 
 The price is reasonable because the quality is super . 
 How much would you like it to be , then ? 
 Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ? 
 I think you've got a real bargain . 

Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have a great variety of Chinese antiques . 
 Well , we have some painting and some porcelain . Which do you like better ? 
 Good . How about the table set ? 
 It's made in Jingdezhen . 
 One thousand eight hundred yuan . 

Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Maybe sandalwood fan is good . 
 Of course . 
 The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan . 
 What else are you interested in ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like . 
 You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture . 
 100 frances . 
 We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars . 
 You are right . 
 OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . 

Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ? 
 How do you like them ? 
 I always have the temptation to eat something there . 
 I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? 
 It doesn't taste good ? 
 That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? 
 I got it . I think it's worth trying . 
 I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . 
 I see . Thank you . 
 We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? 
 You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
 Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . 
 All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . 
 This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . 
 OK , I will wrap them for you . 
 Would you please show me that mural ? 
 It looks so beautiful . How much is it ? 
 That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ? 
 Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it . 
 Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan . 

Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Do I have any other choices ? 
 Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! 

You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ? 
 Tell me about it . I'm interested . 
 Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot ! 
 At the gym ? 

Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever ! 
 A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . 
 You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... 
 Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals . 

This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . 
 I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . 
 Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . 
 Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' 

Good evening , madam . May I help you ? 
 Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . 
 We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . 
 Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . 
 That's fine , madam . 
 Yes , madam . 
 I don't want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the TV , for what ? 
 Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . 
 Right over there . 
 I loved it . I'll take it . 
 Here you go ? 
 No I don't . 
 Not today . Thanks though . 
 Sure . 
 Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ? 
 Great . Thanks for your help . 

We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . 
 I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . 
 I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . 
 It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . 

Hi . Can I help you with anything ? 
 Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ? 
 Here you go . 
 Actually , we have a few to choose from . They are over here . 
 Oh . I'm sorry . I'll check the price for you . It is $ 199 . 
 Yes . Why don't you try this one on . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 Sure . Take your time . 
 No problem at all . 
 Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? 
 So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... 
 That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? 
 I see what you mean ! 
 It's really different , isn't it ? 
 I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . 
 Well , let's order one for starters . 
 That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . 
 We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work . 
 It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company . 
 You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car . 
 Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool . 
 This is the place I was telling you about . 
 Good . 
 Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either . 
 I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar . 
 How fresh is that apple pie over there ? 
 Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then . 
 I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 We call this a ' parking meter ' . 
 P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r . 
 Okay , Bob , What is it ? 
 All right . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid . 
 You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? 
 I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . 
 You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . 
 After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle . 
 No kidding ! When did that happen ? 
 Oh , no . 
 Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? 
 That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! 
 Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? 
 Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? 
 You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . 
 Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there . 
 Send an ambulance fast ! My husband is having a heart attack ! 
 I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield . Oh , hurry , I don't know what to do ! 
 yes , yes , he's right here by me . 
 Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry ! 
 Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ? 
 Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy ! 
 Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy . 
 Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? 
 Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure . Do you want it to be registered ? 
 Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter . 
 you are welcome . 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . 
 Two yuan , please . 
 Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it . 
 I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan . 
 Here are the stamps and your receipt . 
 You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive . 
 Not at all . 
 Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ? 
 My skin is kind of oily . 
 How much is it ? 
 Sounds good . What are the gifts attaching ? 
 I will choose the tonic . 
 That's the very thing I want . 
 Yes . We have all kinds of colors for it . 
 What's your favorite color ? 
 Sometimes pink is not bad , too . 
 Thank you . Anything else ? 

I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us . 

Yes , sir ? 
 That's 68 pounds altogether , please . 

Be careful . The floor is wet . 
 I spilled my drink . 
 Sure . 
 I'll have a go . 
 No , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch ! 
 This is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ... 
 At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? 
 There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! 
 Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ? 
 Yes , no problem . It'll be ready by 2 p . m . 
 Everything about them was different , even the theaters . 
 Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . 
 We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . 
 Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . 
 Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content . 
 Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent . 
 Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . 
 Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't . 
 No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire ! 
 Do you know a lot about cars ? 
 Please . Thank you so much for stopping . 
 That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket . 
 You do ? 
 I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess . 
 What kind of deal ? 
 You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ? 
 If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ? 
 It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! 
 I did . Why ? 
 No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Well , if there is anything I can do to help , let me know . 
 I'm trying to choose a gift . 
 No , but I'd like to get something typical in this region . 
 They're quite nice . But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive . 
 No more than one hundred yuan . 
 Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ? 

This is the house I want to rent . 
 No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . 
 200 dollars per week . 
 It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . 
 Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? 
 Twice a week for work and once for shopping . 
 That's true . Ok , I will think about it . 
 There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect . 
 This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . 
 It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . 
 It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . 
 No problem . Wait for a moment . 
 I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? 
 Moon cakes ? What is that ? 
 Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . 
 What's the difference between these two styles ? 
 Get me some of each . 

Why is there water all over the bathroom floor ? 
 That's OK . As long as you clean it up . 
 Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . 
 Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? 
 It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? 
 Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . 
 I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . 

Ann , it's terrible ! 
 Look , this is a pimple ! 
 How come ? 
 I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . 
 I wasn't aware of that ! 

Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded . 
 I'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 . 
 It's a blue Nissan minivan . 
 The closest garage . What's the charge ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 Thanks . 
 Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 
 It's just what I want . 
 I am really pleased with it . 
 It's super . 
 Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 

Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . 
 I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . 
 Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . 
 In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? 
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 
 Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . 
 I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months . 
 It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . 
 Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? 
 I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . 
 He is really outrageous . 
 I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . 
 Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . 
 I shouted it back of course . 
 What would you do if you were in my shoes ? 
 No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . 
 I am too angry to do that . 
 I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend . 
 She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . 
 Which one would you recommend ? 
 That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . 
 It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy . 
 She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . 
 No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . 
 No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter . 
 That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . 
 I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ? 
 Anything that can keep my skin clean will do . 
 Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance . 
 I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ? 
 I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later . 

What did you buy at the market ? 
 You seem to have bought the whole market ! 
 Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . 
 All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . 
 Why do you want to buy so much ? 
 I see . 
 No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed . 
 Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ? 
 I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock . 
 I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . 
 Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? 
 You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ? 
 Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? 
 Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . 
 Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble . 

I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ? 

Help ! I'm about to drop these books . 
 Thanks ! 
 I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ? 
 It's not special . It can be seen everywhere . 
 It's interesting . Let me see . 
 Yes , how much is it ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 It's none of your business . 
 I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . 
 No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot . 
 That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? 
 Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here . 
 I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? 
 That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ? 
 If so , I'd better try another store . 
 It is about 10 minutes walk . 
 Are we going to come back here for lunch ? 
 I have finished . We can go now . 
 Let's stop at the newsagent , I would like to buy a newspaper . We can also buy postcards for your friends . 
 Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket . 

I need some flowers for my girlfriend . 
 Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion . 
 Money is no object . 
 I will take ten . 
 Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 
 That's ok . Here is the address . 
 Can I have a look at your handworks ? 
 You have quite a range , haven't you ? 
 They are all produced in China , aren't they ? 
 Could you please select me one ? 
 Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . 
 I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? 
 I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . 
 We have great confidence in you . 
 That is a blast from the past . 
 Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . 
 But what are you going to do with that pig ? 
 Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! 
 It still feels really strange to me . 
 How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? 
 I guess you could choose that if you wanted . 
 Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! 
 No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance . 
 Well , how old is your baby ? 
 The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand . 
 You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum . 
 It is feeding-bottle as the free gift . 

We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food . 
 What should we buy ? 
 It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . 
 Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . 
 That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . 
 Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . 
 OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . 

Can I help you ? 
 What kind of stamps do you want ? 
 I must weigh it . 
 It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ? 
 Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all . 

Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? 
 Wow . You look great . 
 What type of diet were you on ? 
 That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? 
 That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? 
 That makes sense . I'm going to try that . 
 I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . 
 Thanks for the advice . 

Nancy , please turn the TV down . 
 I don't care . I have a headache . 
 Why don't you go to bed ? 

Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? 
 He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . 
 How do you propose to help him understand that ? 
 I guess we could go visit once in a while too . 

Oops ! 
 I overcooked the corn . 

I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you ? 
 Not if you take off your jacket . 
 No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? 
 That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . 
 Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . 
 Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! 
 Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . 
 That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . 
 I'm not on a diet though . 
 I like ice cream too much though . 
 It does sound appealing . 
 Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . 
 Can we start tomorrow though ? 
 All the fruit are pretty fresh here . 
 They're four yuan per kilo . 
 Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo . 
 Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . 
 OK . It's 22 yuan 

I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . 
 What's the brand ? 
 Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? 
 You can have a try . Maybe you will like it . 

Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? 
 Which brand are you interested in ? 
 Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? 
 How about Flymo ? It's selling well . 
 Of course . The warranty period is one year . 
 Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . 

Lucy , where are you going ? 
 Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you . 
 Good idea 
 Let's check out the fruit section first . 
 Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . 
 Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets . 
 Do you want to buy something else ? 

Mom , I finished . 
 Of course . 
 OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink . 
 OK . Then I will clean the table . 

I had a busy morning . 
 I watered all the plants . 
 Then I did my laundry . 
 I took the dog for a walk . 
 I vacuumed the entire house . 
 And then I made lunch . 

My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? 
 I wish my parents were a little more lenient . 
 You like going to bed early ? 
 Well , I still hate having a curfew . 

I found a great school for Junior ! 
 We can't be too cautious about these things . 
 There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook ! 
 There is a library right inside the front door . 

What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? 
 I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . 
 I think she is really going to like her teacher though . 
 Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ? 

Tom , it's time for you to take a shower . 
 Why ? You can't be always so lazy . 
 Alright . But you promise this is the last time . 

Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ? 
 I hope I don't have any nightmares tonight . 
 Thanks for tucking me , Mom . 
 Ten more minutes , mom . 
 It's already 3 8 o'clock . 

Peter , take off your pajamas . 
 It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket . 
 Son , it looks great on you . 
 I want some coffee . 
 What have you got ? 
 I think I'll have a latte , please . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Do you have a reservation , sir ? 
 Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? 
 Would you like some drinks ? 

Hi ! Fiona ? I almost didn't recognize you . You are much thinner since I last saw you . 
 How did you do it ? 
 What's the secret then ? 
 Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise . 

Excuse me . I want to pay for these items . 
 How much is it all together ? 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Yes . And can you pack the things up , please ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 Have you a taste for this kind ? 
 What about this ? 
 I have a lot of them . 
 OK , here you are . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 How many carats would you like it to be ? 
 Is this one suitable for you ? 
 What about this ? 
 Then you can buy this one . It's very nice and latest in style . 

Is Bob home ? 

Hello ! 
 I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here . 
 Yes . I'm sure . You have the wrong number . I have used this number for more than 20 years . 
 No , it isn't . It's 1199866 . It seems that you have misdialed . 
 It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone . 
 That's all right . 
 I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . 
 I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ? 
 OK . I will do that . 
 You're welcome . Bye . 
 Is that Sue ? 
 A.This is George . 

Good morning , mom . 
 I'm still sleepy . 
 No , I couldn't fall asleep last night . 
 I am brushing my teeth . 
 Mom ~ the toothpaste dropped on my shorts . 

You have to help to the laundry today . 

Be careful.The floor is slippery . 
 Turn on the shower . 
 Ok . I'll check the heater . Dry yourself with the towel first . 
 Don't forger to come straight home after school . 
 Have you got everything ? 

Jenny , you should go to bed now . 
 Don't stay up late . 
 Well , honey . Turn off the light , lie down and go to sleep . 
 I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ? 
 A draft beer please . 
 Could I have some fruit ? 

Day , I'm home . 
 I'll do it later . 
 Can I have some cookies first , please ? 
 What kind of wine do you offer ? 
 Thanks . 
 What do you recommend ? 
 I'd like to try something typically Chinese . 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 Thank you . 
 It was great . I made some friends . 
 But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard . 

Oh , dear ! which dress should I choose ? I can't make up my mind . Please help me . 
 Which dress do you like best ? 
 Only all right ? 
 Mike , that's no help to me at all . I can't wear both of them at the same time . I want a decision . 
 Oh , yes . The green dress is very smart . but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat . 
 I'd like to have my hair cut . 
 You look so busy . 
 Short on both sides . Not so much in the middle . 
 Yes . You are right . 
 About two months . 
 Good afternoon . I would like my hair done . 
 I'd like to try a new hair-style . Could you show me some pictures of hair styles ? 
 Thanks . Please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . I would like hair spray , please . 
 Beautifully done . 
 No , thanks . How much should I pay ? 
 Here you are . 

What can I do for you ? 
 How would you like your hair cut ? 
 Well , how about like this ? 
 Okay . How about this style ? 
 Can you give me some idea of what you'd like ? 
 OK , I see . 
 First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you . 
 I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying . 
 You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities . 

Good morning . 
 I want to place a long-distance call to London . Is this the right counter ? 
 All right . Can you tell me when I will be able to get through ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun . 
 I guess I'll send it by airmail . 
 No , there are only some vases . 
 Have you got boxes for sale ? 
 Is it all right this time ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , it is . What can I do for you ? 
 Are they urgent , please ? 
 Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days . 
 Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable . 
 Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them . 
 This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt . 

Can I help you ? 
 Is it a photograph or a document ? 
 Could I see both of them ? 
 You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right . 
 Couple of minutes . 
 5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax . 

Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ? 
 I'd like to send this parcel , please . 
 Some books and newspapers . 
 Is it all right ? 
 No , I'd rather send it by sea . 
 Thank you . 

Hello , may I help you ? 
 Photograph or document ? 
 Show me your document , please . 
 Ah , it is clear enough to send . 
 It'll only take a couple of minutes . 
 Twenty yuan . 
 What size do you want it to be ? 
 Oh , I see , that's the size of 12 x 18cm . How many prints do you want to have ? 
 Let me see . Eleven yuan . 
 This is your change . 
 Here will be OK . 
 Please put it on the scale . Where are you mailing it to ? 
 Do you want to mail it by air or sea ? 
 25 yuan by air , 13 yuan by sea . 
 About 2 days . 
 Please fill out this form , and what's in your package ? 
 OK , that will be OK . 

Could I see that automatic camera ? 
 Where is it made ? 
 Is it expensive ? 
 I'll take this one . 
 Yes , give me two rolls of Kodak color film . 

Is this the counter to pick up parcels ? 
 I want to pick up my parcels . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thank you . 

I'm looking for a necklace for my girl friend as a birthday present . 
 I like that one over there . Can you show it to me ? 
 Exactly . How much do you want for it ? 
 Is it made of pure gold ? 
 I'll take it . Please wrap it up for me and give me the receipt . 
 Yes . I'm used to online shopping . It ’ s convenient and time-saving . You can buy anything you want and they will send it to your home or any place you want . 
 You can get the same product at a much lower price . 
 You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . 
 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let ’ s check it out online ! 
 I'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day . 
 Didn't tell me what ? What ? 
 What are you talking about brother ? Spill it . 
 You mean I have to wear the same thing every day ? MOM ! 
 Okay . Do you have your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , but you need a receipt for a refund . 
 Perhaps you would like to talk to customer service . 
 They're right upstairs . 
 Good luck . I hope someone can help you . 
 Hi . Fill it up please . Premium . 
 Oh , can you check my oil and tires while you're at it ? 
 OK , it's open . 
 Oh . Where can I add some air to my tires ? 
 Good . How much does it come to ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 We have many pairs for couples . Look at this counter . 
 You have a very good taste , this pair is the latest product . 
 Both of them are luminous with a time reminder function . They don't need battery , because they can absorb energy from the sun . 
 In addition , they are waterproof and shockproof . 
 We guarantee the quality of the product for 12 months . We also provide a worldwide warranty . 
 2,200 $ . 

May I help you ? 
 You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer . 
 Your total comes to $ 7 . 
 Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . 

Cathy , I'd like to introduce the new microwave stove of mine to you , because it is easy to use . 
 This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat . 
 Oh , it is not so expensive . It only costs me 280 dollars . 
 I think you should work out more too . 
 I have lost about five kilos . 
 I was on a diet and exercised daily . 
 You can try a low-impact workout schedule . Why don't you go to a gym ? 
 The secret is persistence . 
 I'm sorry , but there's no one here by that name . 
 Yes , this is . What number are you calling ? 
 Sure it is . This is 6666777 . 
 It doesn't matter . Bye-bye ! 

Could you give me a taxi to pick me up and take me to the airport before 1:00 p . m . ? 
 I live in room 1106 of the Friendship Hotel . 

Taxi ! Taxi ! Could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ? 
 Over there . 
 What are you buying ? 
 I can check for you , if you'd like . 
 First , we need eggs , milk , and bread . 
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak . 
 Get some snack foods , too , dude . 
 No , but if you can think of anything else , just get it . 
 My washing machine isn't working . 
 The water will not drain . 
 No , that's it . 
 When will you be able to fix it ? 
 That would be perfect . 
 See you then . 
 That's great ! 
 This TV is $ 2500 . 
 That's how much this t . v costs . 
 This television is of very high quality . 
 By how much ? 
 I'm sorry , but the price is final . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 Is this the right subway to the Wall Street ? 
 Could you tell me shall I take the express or local train ? 
 Which of them is the local train , please ? 
 How much is the fare ? 
 What should I do with the token ? 

Good morning , Sir . 
 Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
 That ’ s a little troublesome . 
 Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 

Let ’ s go to Wangfujing by bus . 
 En , where do we pay the fares ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Two hundred and thirty yuan . 
 You can come later . 
 It's half past seven . 
 We offer 24 - hour service . 

I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Where can you park around here ? 
 Is a shop there ? 
 Just stop here for a moment . The police will not notice . 
 All right . Let's go to the square to have a look . 
 Sure . What time do you want to go ? 
 That sounds good . Today we work on Legs and forearm . 
 I'm on a weekly schedule . You're messing everything up . 
 Aright . I'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then . 
 Of course . Turn right at the next intersection and go straight . The post office will be on your left ( side ) . 
 It looks wonderful . Very authentic . 
 OK . So , what can you recommend ? 
 Is it salty ? 
 What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean ? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that . 
 No . I'll try them . Sounds good . 
 Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us . 
 Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group . 
 No where special . I was just taking a walk . 
 To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape . 
 That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play . 
 Yes , I ’ ll have the Texas chili burger . 
 A large , with tons of ketchup . 
 I'll have a diet coke , please . 
 Take-out , please . 
 No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . 
 I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it . 
 Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . 
 I ’ ll give you a call around 6:00 and stop by around 6:30 . 
 Great , I ’ ll see you then . 

All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health . 
 For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise . 
 That's not a bad idea . How much is it ? 
 Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in . 
 No where special . I was just taking a walk . 
 To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape . 
 That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play . 
 I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ? 
 I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ? 
 I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons . 

One of my students told me she was very depressed today . 
 Her father is dying . 
 Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . 
 I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . 
 Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . 

Have you seen the movie Batwoman ? 
 Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it . 
 Yeah , but she looks amazing . 
 Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . 
 I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil . 
 No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . Finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature . 
 No , Sharon Stone did . 
 Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ? 
 Not much . I started exercising . 
 Yeah , and I need to start improving my health . 
 That's about all . 
 Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems . 
 True . But I think it is worth it . When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Let me see . 
 No , the damage is minor . 
 4:00 p . m .. 

Mike , I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight . 
 I'm sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . 
 Please forgive me . You have my word . I'll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise . 
 Thank you for understanding . I promise I'll make it up to you . 
 Yes , I'd like to get some gas . 
 Unleaded . My car is new . 
 Fill it up . I will have a tour tomorrow . 
 Yes , please . 
 Give me a quart of light oil . 

Damn Scott . You got big . 
 How long have you been lifting weights ? 
 Yeah . Last time I saw you , it was like 2 years ago . 
 How often do you go to the gym ? 
 That's a lot . 
 I don't think I have the discipline for that . 

What do you do besides work and watching TV ? 
 Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ? 
 How do you exercise ? 
 How often do you go ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 Would you like regular car wash package ? 
 Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine . 
 Of course . We wash the windows inside and out . 
 We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find . 
 OK . I see . 
 Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu . 
 Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good . 
 You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious . 
 Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes . 
 I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ? 

You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? 
 Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . 
 Hi . I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Well . He doesn't wear ties that often . 
 That sounds good . Which one do you recommend ? 
 I like them . Do you have matching belts ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll take them . 
 A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car . 
 They're saying it was already there . 
 I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there . 
 I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . 
 We'll see what happens after court . 
 Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No , it ’ s only ten-minute's walk . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it . 
 It ’ s about 20 minutes ’ walk , I think . 
 Yes , you can take the No . 5 bus over there . Get off at the next stop . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Thanks , honey . It's great to be back . 

Excuse me . Does this bus go to the National Library of China ? 
 How long is the ride ? 
 Thank you . Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I'm a stranger here . 

Where did you get these peanuts , Mike ? 
 Thanks ! 
 I'd like to have some more . It's really good . 
 There's still a lot left-have some more ! 

I'm hungry . Do we have anything to eat ? 
 That's fine with me . 
 Good idea . How about a cup of coffee ? 

Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 Do you want to mail it by air or by sea ? 

Would you like to mail it by air or sea ? 
 About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days . 
 OK , the postage is 275 yuan . 
 This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day . 

You look terrific and in good shape . 
 How do you keep fit ? 
 Yoga ? It sounds interesting . 
 Anything else ? 
 Are you interested in swimming ? 

What are you working on ? 
 What budget ? 
 How much money can you spend ? 
 Why only $ 300 ? 
 For what ? 
 Your budget is a good idea . 

Would you check the engine , please ? It is knocking . 
 Yes , please . When can you get it done ? 
 By credit . 
 We have a great selection . What decade are you looking for ? 
 We have six . 
 Actually , two of them have dancing figures . 
 A good choice . I prefer that one myself . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything . 
 Even if they break down , they're still works of art . 
 You can exchange this dress with anything of the same value . 
 I'm sorry . There are no sales today . 
 Everything's going to be on sale next weekend . 
 Okay . I'll see you then . 
 I want to have a haircut . 
 How much is a regular haircut without shampoo ? 
 And how much for haircut with shampoo ? 
 Since it is , I need a haircut with shampoo . 
 SEEK , please . 
 What hairstyle do you feel will look best on me ? 
 I have the same idea as you . 
 No problem . What size would you like ? 
 How about this one ? It's our biggest — 16 ' in diameter . 
 Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum . 
 Here you go . Same pan , but with a state-of-the-art , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 Great . Will that be cash or charge ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan . 
 It's in aisle A . 
 I don't know . Check the flyer or check with the produce person . 
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 per dozen . 
 Yes , they're on sale today . 
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise . 
 I often eat fish and eggs . 
 Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much . 
 Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . 
 I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day . 
 Well , I walk every day . 
 Yes , quite right . 
 I'll take two value meals . 
 One Coke and the other a Sprite , please . 
 Yes , I'd like that , then . 
 No , thanks . That will be all . 
 I scheduled a delivery for tomorrow . 
 I would like to reschedule . 
 Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow ? 
 Yes , will that be possible ? 
 Is 2:30 Okay ? 
 Thank you , and I'm sorry for the change of plans . 
 OK . When should we be there ? 
 All right , if there's no hold-ups . 
 Please take us to Harvard University . By the way , is it far from here ? 
 ( Get here ) Here we are , sir . 
 It ’ s 35 dollars on the meter . 
 Thank you . Have a nice day . 
 Yes , I would like to book a table for six for the next Monday . 
 At 6:30 on next Monday evening . 
 Chinese food . 
 Please book it under the name of Mr . Peter . 
 That's right . 

Good evening , sir . Are you ready to order now ? 
 Chinese food is divided into eight big cuisines , such as Cantonese food , Sichuan food , Fujisan food , etc . Our restaurant is famous for Sichuan style . 
 Yes . Cantonese food is lighter while Sichuan food is spicy and hot . 
 How about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the ' Tofu ' beancurd ? They are our specialties . 
 Yes . Sour soup of Sichuan style . It's our chef ’ s recommendation . 
 Sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . While waiting , would you like anything to drink ? 
 OK , sir . We'll try our best to serve you as soon as possible . 
 I would like to book a table for seven thirty o'clock , please . 
 For four people . We'd like a quiet table with a fine view of the river . 
 This is Peter Kaufman . 
 Peter Kaufman , P-E-T-E-R ( Peter ) , K-A-U-F-M-A-N ( Kaufman ) . 
 Bye-bye . 
 Okay . 
 I'm sorry , madam , there ’ s a limit to the speed . 
 I'm sorry about that . What ’ s your flight time ? 
 Don ’ t worry , madam . I guess we should get there not later than 1:30 p . m . 
 Here we are . 
 Just a minute . Here's your change . 
 What do you need to buy ? 
 Where are you going to go look for one ? 
 You don't know where you want to look for one ? 
 Do you want to know where I got mine from ? 
 I purchased mine from IKEA . 
 Not at all , but you get what you pay for . 
 What did you find ? 
 Go and try it on . 
 I love that shirt on you . 
 They don't really fit you right . 
 That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though . 
 That would be a good idea . 
 Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls . 
 Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie . 
 Why , she's only $ 29.95 . 
 Excellent . Would you like anything else ? 
 The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ? 
 Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us . 
 I would like to return an item . 
 I want to return this cellphone . 
 It's broken . 
 The phone turns off by itself . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Certainly . Do you have your receipt ? 
 Now , why do you want to exchange it ? 
 I'm sorry . I'll get you a new player . 
 Okay , here's a new one for you . 
 Pots and pans are right over there . 
 Could I interest you in our store credit card ? 
 But our credit card saves you 10 percent . 
 Here . Let me give you an application form . 
 Okay . Enjoy your browsing . 
 I'm just shopping . 
 Some new clothes . How about you ? 
 Have you found anything nice yet ? 
 Where'd you get those ? 
 Those are really cute . 
 I would like that . Thank you . 
 Here's the application form . 
 Thank you . Now if you'll just give me a credit card . 
 Thank you . 
 It looks great . 
 Will this be cash or charge ? 
 Just sign here , please . 
 Here's your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 I apologize for their tardiness . 
 Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . 
 I'm going to refund your money right now . 
 All right . Do you have the receipt ? 
 May I ask why you're returning the radio ? 
 Would you like to exchange it ? 
 Certainly . This will take only a few seconds . 
 80 yuan . 
 It's a bit . But I can give you a discount . 
 No . I'm afraid the price is too low . 
 I'm sorry , but I think you should give me no less than 65 yuan . 

Hello ! Where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ? 
 That is a wonderful idea . 
 Thank you for your help . 

I want to buy a rain coat . Could you please show me one ? 
 I like yellow best . How much does it cost ? 
 It's nice , but that's very steep for a rain coat . Could you give me a 20 percent discount ? 
 In that case , I don't think I'll buy one here . 
 Of course . How can I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 Here . How do you like this one ? 
 You can try it on in the fitting room over there . 
 This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ? 
 What is the material of this dress ? 
 That's good . Can you give me a reduction ? 
 Do you have any cheaper ones ? 

Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . 
 And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . 
 Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a book on Chinese history . 
 Em , it's delicious ! 
 You're lucky . 
 I'm doing it for fun and fitness . 
 At the age of 64 ? You're kidding ! 
 I'd like to buy a skirt . 
 I like one with flowers on its brim . 
 It seems too short . 
 It looks nice . How much is it ? 
 Is there any cheaper one ? 
 I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now . It is better than this one although this one is cheaper . 
 Here is the money . 
 No , thanks . 
 I would like to look at some watch . 
 Pure gold ones , please . 
 What is the price for this one ? 
 That's quite steep . Can you come down a little bit ? 
 It's rather more than I was thinking of paying . 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 I'd be glad to . He's really cute . 
 Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it . 
 But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ? 
 Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ? 
 That's wonderful ! I like swimming . 
 well , I'm looking for some summer clothes . 
 Really ? What's that ? 
 I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ? 
 This one is good . 
 I'll take this one . How much are they ? 
 Here you are . 
 I go to the gym every day to keep fit . 
 I've been doing yoga for a long time . 
 Yoga is used to promote people's physical , intellectual and mental harmony and healthy . 
 Oh , I feel really tired and sweat a lot . 
 Sure . But more importantly , I can have peace of mind . 
 You bet , as long as I can collect enough money . 
 Aren't you crazy ? 
 I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout . 
 I began to went there last month . 
 Well , I think I'm in better condition now . 
 It was at the beginning . You just need to keep it up . 
 Of course , yes . 
 Yes , of course . 
 I'd be very pleased . 
 First of all , you should pay attention to what you eat . Don't eat too much food with high calories , such as chocolate , ice cream and the like . 
 Stay away from fried foods . Fried foods are fried in oil or fat . 
 Do not be a couch potato . You should do more exercise . 

How are you ? 
 Could you tell me how you dealt with it this time ? 

You look depressed . What's on your mind ? 
 Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight . 
 Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health . 
 You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time . 

Do you know where I can find old music boxes ? 
 What's that ? I've never heard of such a thing . 
 OK , Where can I find one ? 

Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest . 

What shall we do today ? 
 Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ? 
 Shall we do some jogging ? 
 I feel well now . 
 Quite right . 
 Where are you going to find one ? 
 Do you want to know where I bought mine ? 
 I got it from IKEA . 
 It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set . 
 The furniture is built extremely well . 
 Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic . 
 I feel so tired . 
 Why ? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day . 
 Are you sure ? 
 OK . Let me try . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? 
 The round shape pair ? 
 I think it suits you well . 
 120 yuan . 

Bill , will you be free at noon ? 
 We need a new filing cabinet in the office . Could you go downtown with me after lunch ? 
 Yes , the same as the one we have . And we also need some small articles in the office , such as pens , clips , erasers and sticky notes . 
 Susan has already given me a list of all the stationery which we need to buy . 
 Yes , we do . I'll show you several kinds . 
 Sure , we'll take 20 % off the price . 
 This color is becoming to you , too . 
 The pink one is 30 yuan , and the purple one is 35 yuan . 
 I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . 
 I suppose he won't come back until 6 p . m . By the way , do you want to call later , or would you like to leave a message ? 
 Okay , I'll do that . 
 You're welcome , bye ! 
 This one ? 
 The mirror is behind you , sir . 
 No , sir . It's a genuine bonnet . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Yes , let me see some of your hats , please . 
 It's a little bit tight . 
 Yes , it fits all right now . I'll take it . Please put it in a bag and I'll take along . 
 How much is it ? 
 Here is the money . 
 Nothing else , thank you . 
 I ’ m thinking about it . How much is it ? 
 Oh , dear . It ’ s too expensive . Can you give me a better price ? 
 It ’ s still too much . Can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ? 
 I see . Can I pay by traveler ’ s checks ? 

Could you tell me where you put all the pots and pans ? 
 Where do you keep the dishes , Baker ? 
 And the forks and spoons ? 
 OK , I know . Would you please help me clean the kitchen ? 

Please help yourself at your dishes . I hope you ’ ll enjoy what you ’ Ve got . 
 Would you like to try my special recipe ? 
 It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes . 
 I want to buy a hat . 
 Is this one fit for you ? It is nice . 
 How about this one ? 
 You must like this pink one , don't you ? 
 Fifty yuan . 
 How about forty-five ? 
 OK . 
 I'm just browsing , thanks . 
 Well , how about fifty percent discount ? If so , I'll buy that fur coat . 
 So won ’ t you come down any more ? 

I'm looking for some lipsticks . Do you still have some in peach rose ? 
 Great . I'll take one . 
 Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ? 
 That ’ s all . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ? 
 Are they ? In that case , I'll be glad to give your money back . 
 Never mind . It ’ s just my duty . 
 Hello , I ordered a dining table last week . The order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . I would like to exchange it . 
 Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 Good morning . I'm calling to ask if you have a vacant apartment . 
 I prefer a one-bedroom apartment . 
 I'll share it with one of my friends . What ’ s in a one-bedroom apartment ? 
 Is there any furniture ? 
 It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ? 
 When can I come over ? 
 OK . Good-bye . 

Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters . 
 Very quiet and safe . And it ’ s got a lot of trees and plants . 
 Yep , it ’ s near a bus stop . 

Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ? 
 Take your time . 
 Oh , please do not mention it any more . Last night he did it for the first time . 
 Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow . 
 Ha-ha . Last night , I only told him practice makes perfect . 
 Yeah , it will become a wider trend . 
 I'd like to have a shave . 
 Sure . But my beard is rough . 
 Yes , please . 
 Wonderful . How much is the cost altogether ? 
 Here you are . Thank you , bye-bye ! 

Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover . 
 Sound great . Let's go ! 
 True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head . 
 You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven . 
 Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first . 
 Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ? 
 Sure . 
 No problem . 
 I think it's beautiful . I want to hang it in the living room . 
 That's the beauty of it — the imperfection . 
 Your daughter . She sold it at the school auction . 
 I guess you see the value in it , too . 
 Brad , it's her birthday . Let's get her something really special . 
 I mean beautiful and heartfelt-something that will make her cry . 
 Women like that kind of thing , beautiful thoughts that are touching . 
 Okay , you get your funny one and I'll get my beautiful one . 
 I want to try on this suit . 
 I'm afraid it's too narrow across the shoulders . Do you have a larger one ? 
 It's a bit loose . Do you have a middle size ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Certainly . It's right over there . 

Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave . 
 Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ? 
 No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ? 
 Absolutely . Several men have tried it in my A shop . Do you want to try ? 

Could you show me where the ice cream is located ? 
 This is my first time here . 
 I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables . 

Here is the fish counter . Look at the lobsters and crabs . Shall we have some ? 
 Sorry , I forgot . I don ’ t like seafood , neither . 
 Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ’ Ve got enough food . Let ’ s go over to the check-out stand . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We carry products from three large manufacturers and some imported ones , too . Do you have a specific model in mind ? 
 This one from Sony gives a very sharp picture . 
 Which brand do you prefer ? 
 OK . Come with me , please . 
 I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . 
 I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale . 
 Yes , many people make that mistake . 
 You're right . Many ads are like that . 
 Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale . 
 The dress was on sale yesterday . 
 I'm so sorry , but rules are rules . 
 I'm sorry I couldn't help you . 
 I want a leather jacket . 
 Size 40 . 
 Let me see . Do you think a brown one will do ? 
 Really ? Please get it for me . 
 Is this dress made of pure silk ? 
 Is it washable ? 
 How much , please ? 
 All right . Will you wrap it for me ? 

Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ? 
 I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ? 
 That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye ! 

Would you like to have this kind of suitcase ? 
 You can check it , sir . 

Can I help you ? 
 This is the new style.Two hundred and twenty-eight . 
 Of course , please . 
 Two hundred and ten yuan . It is the lowest price . 
 Well , two hundred yuan . 
 OK , I'll wrap it for you . 
 What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? 
 May I show you gold ones or platinum ones ? 
 Pure gold or carats ? 
 OK . 
 1336 yuan . 
 Could you show me the coat on the shelf ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ? 
 Well , how do I look in this one ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 What ? But today is my birthday ! 
 But Steven , why don't you ask for a leave ? ... Steven , why don't you speak ? Are you still there ? 
 Okay ! Bye ! 
 What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? 
 May I show you gold ones or jade ones ? 
 OK , here they are . 
 Eight hundred yuan . 
 I'm sorry , we only sell at fixed prices . 

Would you please recommend a diamond for me ? 
 I prefer a diamond mounted in a ring . 
 Do you guarantee its quality ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 How many carats diamond do you want ? 
 Is this one suit for you ? 
 What about this ? 
 Yes , try this one please . 
 3,500 yuan . 

Would you show me this brooch ? 
 What is this made of ? 
 Yes , I will . But how much is it ? 
 It's expensive for me . 
 It is genuine , isn't it ? 

Can I help you , Miss ? 
 How soon do you want it ? 
 No problem . 
 Certainly . 

Will you give me a hand , sir ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Hey , Jack , I'd better go now . 
 Right ! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p . m . 
 Okay , no problem . Bye ! 

Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 Give me your water and electricity bills , please . 
 You should pay 160 yuan for the electricity fee and 80 yuan for the water fee . 
 Yes . Will you pay by cash or credit card ? 
 I get 250 yuan from you , and this is the change , 10 yuan . 
 Bye . 
 We want to look at some of your products . 
 Could you commend me some moisturizers ? 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , very good . I will buy this one . 
 No . Thank you . 

The telephone is ringing . Can you answer it , Sue ? 
 Thanks , Sue . 
 Depending on what you consider a lot . 
 Couple times a week . How about you ? 
 How much can you drink ? 
 You're a light weight . 
 I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . 
 No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . 
 If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . 
 You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . 
 Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers . 

Hello . In order to kill your time you can experience our facial massage for free . 
 This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage . I hope that you can feel comfortable . 
 Thank you . 
 Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut . 
 Please cut the sides shorter , but not so much at the back . 
 That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now . 
 Very good , thanks . 
 No , thanks . 
 We're on our own tonight . Dad's taking mom out . 
 You know , on a date . They're going to dinner . 
 Yep . They said they're reviving an old tradition . 
 That's right , once a week . Do you want to order a Pizza ? 
 Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated . 
 Really ? 
 Yes , and seven days a week . 
 Follow me , please . 
 No , you don't have to . 

Excuse me , do you sell apples ? 
 Do you sell them individually or by weight ? 
 Could you weigh these , please ? 
 A sack of cherries , please . 

May I help you ? 
 How about this one ? It smells like green tea and is our best seller . Try it . 
 It goes for $ 40 . 

Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . 
 I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . 
 Yes . It's a traditional dish . 
 You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . 
 Enjoy yourself , sir . 
 We have Sichuan food , Hangzhou food and Beijing Food . Which do you like best ? 
 OK . How about Dongpo meat ? 
 Do you like to use chopsticks 
 Do you like some soup ? 
 We have beef soup and tomato soup . 
 According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first . 
 All right . I'll be back right away . 
 Yes , sir , where are you going ? 
 Get on , please . 
 I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour . 
 We are really in a hurry . 
 I'll do my best . 
 With pleasure . 
 I think you are a quick learner . 
 In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? 

May I help you ? 
 Yes , madam . What sort of gloves do you want ? 
 Certainly . What size do you take ? 
 I think a six is your size . How do you like these ? I can recommend them , they're very reliable . 

May I take your order now ? 
 How would you like your eggs ? 
 And your toast , light or dark ? 
 Now or later ? 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . 
 Just a moment , please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 All right . Your name , please . 
 Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ? 
 OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye . 

What are you doing ? 
 Are there any good programs on TV ? 
 Which Channel is it ? 
 It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? 
 Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? 
 Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? 
 And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . 

Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? 
 Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? 
 Let me see . It seems a little late . 
 OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 . 
 It's John . 

Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ? 
 We also have a cat and a dog . 
 No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday . 
 Who takes the dog on Saturday ? 
 Do you help with the housework ? 

You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . 
 Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail . 
 Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! 
 I am cooking now ! 
 I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! 
 I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? 
 That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . 
 It's OK . Please have a taste of it . 
 Thank you for your praise . 
 I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . 
 Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Don't you think it's a bit bright ? 
 That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own . 
 That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 

Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down . 
 That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ? 

Boy , come here ! 
 Bring me a cup of coffee , please . 
 I prefer strong . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 It's very good . How do you make it ? 
 This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . 
 You Americans usually have nutritious food . 
 We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . 

Here , Let me get the door for you . 
 Do you need a hand with that ? 
 Don't worry about it . 
 Is he doing very well at school ? 
 What's his problem ? 
 How can his he do that ? 

Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . 
 But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . 

There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? 
 What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? 
 I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories . 
 Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . 
 I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . 
 Nothing . 
 Promise that you won't get angry . 
 It's a kitty . 
 Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . 
 Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . 
 I will . Thank you , Mummy . 
 You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . 
 To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . 
 Yes , something just opened up . 
 It's a one-bedroom , one-bathroom apartment . 
 I like feature films best . How about you ? 
 I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot . 

Hello ? 
 Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . 
 Yes . Who are you looking for again ? 
 Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . 
 She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party . 
 Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called . 
 Bye bye . 
 We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ? 
 Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ? 
 I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . 
 Yes . But not including the utilities . 
 I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know . 

How much is the rent ? 
 And how much is the deposit ? 

Mmm ... it is delicious . 
 Yes . It's superb . 
 In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ? 
 Yes , I've got it . 
 Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ? 
 Now , I've got it . Thank you . 
 I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ? 
 Is there any furniture in it ? 
 What's the rent for a year ? 
 Where is it located ? 
 That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? 
 OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . 

Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ? 
 Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment . 
 Sure , a studio would be fine . 
 Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? 
 That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? 

Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? 
 Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? 

It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . 
 I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? 
 Oh , great idea ! 
 Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? 
 That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . 

I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised . 
 That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . 
 I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . 
 Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ? 
 Ok . Thank you . 
 Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ? 
 For two people . We would like a quiet table , please . 
 This is Mr . William . 
 William . W-I-L-L-I-A-M . 

A friend told me I might find a room here . 
 What do you charge ? 
 OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ? 

I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening . 
 Do you have pot service at noon ? 
 OK , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow . 
 Black . 

Can you show me some jade , please ? 
 No , but I do like jade bracelets . 
 Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? 
 I wonder which looks more lustrous . 
 Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . 
 Yes . If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available . 
 800 Yuan a month . 
 Sorry , but I'm on my way out now . Could you come back in an hour ? 
 No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months . 
 Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager . 
 It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references . 
 Perhaps your employer could supply us with one . 
 Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . 
 There's an open house this weekend . 
 It starts at 11AM in the morning . 
 Yes . I've got a small room . 
 200 Yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed . 
 Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone . 
 Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now . 
 No , not for a few months . 
 It's a one-year lease . 
 No , all the leases are for one year . We don't have month-to-month leases . 
 You're welcome . 
 Gas and water are included . 
 Yes , electricity is not included in the rent . 
 I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ? 
 Sorry , my English isn ’ t so good . Could you speak a little slower ? 
 I like word games . 
 I don't like it at all . 
 I'm not one for the games . 
 What about playing go ? 

Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ? 
 Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
 Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 

Miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ? 
 This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free . 
 It gives your skin a very natural healthy look . 

What's the problem , sir ? 
 Do you keep the receipt ? 
 What do you want me to do about it ? 

This way , please . We've got a nice private for you . 
 Here we are . I hope you will like it . 
 And here is the menu . I'll come back soon . 

Do you play cards ? 
 What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ? 

Good evening . Welcome to our restaurant . 
 I'm sorry , sir . The rooms are not available now . But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall ? I can find a table by the window for you . 
 Can I have your name , please ? 
 I'll ask waitress to show you the way . 

Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 Er ... Hum ... Got it . 
 Right ! 
 I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
 Do you want to buy a new bicycle ? 
 What happened to your old one ? 
 I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back . 
 Look at this mountain bike . It is only £ 330 . Do you like it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK , let's go and ask . 
 That's fine . You must try this dish . 
 It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . 
 Sure . It's a most popular dish . 
 We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? 
 We have French and Thousand Island . 

I'd like to buy a house about 300m with a garden . Can you help me ? 
 Where is it ? 
 How many rooms are there ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK . How much is the deposit ? 

Hi Sam . 
 When did you buy your new computer ? 
 So what's the problem ? 
 Can I have a look ? 
 Oh this is the new little EEE notebook from Asks . How much did you pay ? 
 Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time . 
 That will be perfect . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . 
 Very well . 
 I want egg soup . 
 I'd like to have some meat . 
 No , thank you . 
 What is it ? 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 No , thank you 
 What's the matter with it ? 
 How about the tires ? 

Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? 
 Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? 
 OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? 
 And do I take that road ? 
 Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ? 
 I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . 

May I take your order now ? 
 Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' . 
 Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish . 
 Then , how about this one ? 
 Very good . Could I serve you anything else ? 
 My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch . 

Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . 
 So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . 
 Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . 
 And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . 
 Yes , this is everything on the list . 
 Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? 

Good evening . 
 Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim . 
 It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ? 
 I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . 
 Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim . 
 Yes , I will . 
 We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
 We need to find a good realtor . 
 What do you mean ? 
 But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
 I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . 
 So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
 And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
 Why ? 
 Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
 I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 

Where to , madam ? 
 I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam . 
 Thank you . How much is the fare ? 
 Here you are . Keep the change . 

Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 Here is the menu . 
 No , thank you . I'm on a diet . 
 I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . 
 I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . 
 How much do they weigh ? 
 But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . 
 Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it . 
 It's only about a five-minute walk . 
 You're welcome . 
 To this place , please . 
 How long does it take to get to the hotel ? 
 Here's the hotel . 
 That's 10 dollars . 
 Do you know in which area ? 
 I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ? 
 Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station . 
 OK . 
 Hi , I am just looking . 
 What year is it ? 
 How about the mileage ? 
 What do you mean 7B 
 Oh , why such a high mileage ? 
 Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? 
 How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll have to think about it . 
 Okay . 
 We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . 
 You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? 
 While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . 
 I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . 
 No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . 
 And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? 
 Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . 
 Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? 
 Not really . 
 Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out . 
 Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . 

Miss , may I help you ? 
 It's because of the view . 
 Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . 
 There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . 
 There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . 
 Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . 
 The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . 
 Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . 
 It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . 
 You're welcome . 
 I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . 
 That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . 
 I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . 
 Every fifteen minutes . 
 The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . 
 The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . 
 You are welcome . 
 I'd like a coffee please . 
 What have you got ? 
 Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please . 

Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate . 
 Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ? 
 I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . 
 Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . 
 Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . 
 Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . 
 Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . 
 I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . 
 Yes , you're at the right stop . 
 Are you new here ? 
 Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . 
 One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . 
 It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus . 
 Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel . 
 Oh no ! What shall I do ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Here we are on the train . 
 I hear many people have cars . 
 Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? 
 I see . 
 Good morning . 
 Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . 
 I'm going to Wangfujing . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Three yuan . 
 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . 
 That's very easy . The exit is always open . 
 My pleasure . 
 Of course . What is your size ? 
 OK . I'll get it for you . 
 Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? 

Can I see some men's watches ? 
 What functions does this watch have ? 
 Is it waterproof ? 
 I'll take it . Please set the watch for me . 
 Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient . 
 We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . 
 Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket . 
 No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 
 I'd like to buy a shirt . 
 I prefer the blue one . 
 I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ? 
 Can I try it on ? 

Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? 
 No , the one next to it . 
 Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? 
 Yes , please . How much is it ? 
 It looks good . OK . I'll take it . 
 All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here . 
 The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train 
 No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . 
 I'll try Chinese wine . 
 OK . Give me one , please . 
 Thank you . 

May I recommend you Tsingtao beer ? 
 Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China . 
 Yes . The beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the Lao Mountain . 
 Fine , sir . 
 Tin or bottle ? 
 Would you like it on the rocks , sir ? 
 You're welcome . 
 Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ? 
 No , ice will spoil the taste . 
 Yes . Something non-alcoholic , please . 
 A glass of juice please . 

I'd like to reserve a table for two , please . 
 Around 8: 30 p . m . 
 Yes , Anthony Fox . 

Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 

Two number 3s , please . 
 Diet Coke . 
 Regular , please . 
 No , thanks . 
 For here . 
 Yes , sir . How would you like to pay the bill , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . But we only accept American Express , Master card and Visa . What kind do you have ? 
 Wait a moment , please . 
 I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please . 
 I'm not quite sure . What do you have ? 
 Very well , I'll try the banana flavor . 
 No , thanks . That will be all . 
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 
 On all our new cars , the standards include 
 Why not , sir ? 
 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . 
 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 

For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . 
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? 
 My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . 
 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 
 Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car . 
 Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . 

Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ? 
 That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ? 
 It sounds good . 
 Really ? Let me have a try . 

Hello , how are you ? I am Jack . 
 What brings you here ? 
 Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one . 
 Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 . 
 You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . 
 Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do . 
 Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . 
 You are really tough . You got a deal . 

Hi ! Do you want a fill-up ? 
 Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ? 
 Regular is $ 1.15 , Super is $ 1.25 and Premium is $ 1.39 . 
 Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ? 

We'd like some local-flavored pastry . Can you recommend some ? 
 What is that ? 
 That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that . 
 OK . We will try some . 
 No , it's enough . 
 OK . Thank you . 
 We'd like this course for two , please . 
 Well , can't you make it for two only ? 
 I see . Well , what do you recommend then ? 
 Right , we'll have these three . 
 No , thanks . 

Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 Would you like an appetizer ? 
 Would you like some soup first ? 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Have you decided on anything ? 
 How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? 
 Are you interested in today's special ? 
 Twice cooked spicy pork slices . 
 Anything else ? 

Would you show us the menu ? 
 I'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , I'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards . 
 It sounds good . I'll try it . 
 Well , I'll have a glass of mineral water . 
 No , thank you . I think it's enough for dinner . 

Is there a car park near the supermarket ? 
 I see . Thanks . 
 Yes , my engine warning light is on . 
 Just since today . 
 It runs fine . 
 Okay . 
 Okay . 
 No , you can give a call when you have done checking . 

Can I help you ? 
 What's wrong with them ? 
 The front brake ? 
 What kind of car is it ? 
 Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out . 
 No . 
 About half an hour . 

May I have your order , please ? 
 OK . How do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ? 
 Anything else ? 
 It will be ready right away . 
 Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . 
 What's special about these things ? 
 Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . 
 Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium . 
 My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure . 
 Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . 
 I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . 
 I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently . 

May I take your order ? 
 Yes , take your time , please . 
 Fine . 
 The special today is steak . 
 What would you like to go with your steak ? 
 I see . What would you like for dessert ? 

Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ? 
 I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . 
 Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . 
 Seriously ? 
 Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . 
 But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body . 
 Yes . We charge 50 cents for iced water . 
 Sure . Do you need anything else ? 
 I'll put all that into the bag for you . 
 No , there's no charge for those . 
 I'll take two value meals . 
 One Coca Cola and the other a Sprite , please . 
 Yes , I'd like that , then . 
 No , thanks . That will be it . 
 Give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large Coke . 
 That's fine . 
 Here's a twenty note . 
 Thanks . 
 All right . How about this one by the window ? 
 May I take your order now , sir ? 
 Our restaurant is famous for its seafood . 
 Shrimp salad is our speciality , took 
 What would you like to drink ? 

Good evening , Mr . Frank . Bourbon on the rocks ? 
 What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head . 
 Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate . 
 Yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico . People drink it with salt and lemon . 
 Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on . 
 It's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like Japanese Sake . Showing is a city in China . 
 By the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as Great Wall White Wine . 
 I'm always at your service . 
 Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink . 
 $ 12 . 
 It is cheap . 
 $ 10 . That's the best I can do . 

I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife . 
 I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls . 
 Is there a price reduction ? 
 How much is that one ? 
 OK . I'll take it . Thank you . 
 Sure . Should I check your radiator ? 
 That'll be ¥ 150 . 
 Fine . Do you want your windshield cleaned ? 
 It comes to $ 15 . 
 Three . Two adults and one kid . 
 Yes . How much do you charge for it ? 
 I see . Where can I get the food ?

 Fine , bring us double . 
 Then what about you , Miss ? 
 The vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu .

 Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? 
 Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me . 
 Good ! 
 What's this amount for ? 
 I see . Can I pay by credit card ? 

You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ? 
 Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . 
 He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . 
 For what ? Are you taking up painting ? 
 Oh , good . How old is your niece ? 
 It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good . 
 No , thank you . Check , please . 
 Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you . 
 I'd love to . 
 OK . 
 Let me help you . 
 If I remember correctly , there's a quiz show . 
 Let's see what else is on first . 
 If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains . 
 No , I'm going alone . 
 Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby . 
 Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting . 
 OK , sir . How do you like your meal ? 
 I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all . 

Is our destination the amusement park ? 
 What are you going to enjoy ? 
 I like neither . 
 OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun . 
 It doesn't matter . We can go to the ferris wheel later . 

Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? 
 About the same . But I'm looking for a job , so I have to answer the phone often . 
 That's good . How can I order it ? 
 Thank you . I'll have a try . 

Can I pay my bill here ? 
 How much is the charge ? 
 Do you receive checks ? 
 Here is my card . 
 I got stuck in a traffic jam . 
 It looks like you're very interested in the circus . 
 I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good . 
 Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first . 
 We can take a bus there . 
 I think so . 
 No , it's too crowded . 
 Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! 
 We got on the wrong bus . 
 You know that I have no secrets toward you . 
 Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat . 
 Wait a moment . It's $ 30 . 
 OK , one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12 . 
 Sure . At what time ? 
 Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ? 
 Yes , sir . 

Could I have a refund on this ? 
 Then can I exchange it for something else with the same price ? 
 OK . I will . 
 Extension 1616 , please . 
 Then , will you try extension 235 ? 

You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? 
 So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? 
 Do you do the same exercises every day ? 
 Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? 
 Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . 
 Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . 
 I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . 
 Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? 
 History . 
 Thirty percent ? 
 Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? 
 Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? 
 I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . 
 What ? Are you serious ? 
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . 
 But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . 
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . 
 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . 

Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . 
 ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . 
 Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... 
 Steak , please . 
 Medium rare , please . 
 May I have a glass of red wine , please ? 

Excuse me . Can you take me to the airport ? 
 Kennedy Airport . 
 Thank you , but I'd rather keep this case with me . 
 OK . Where should we go ? 
 Fine . I'll be ready in a minute . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Can you speak a little louder ? You sound very indistinct with the hissing noise . 

Excuse me . This bus goes downtown , doesn't it ? 
 The Workers'Stadium . 
 Will you let me know where to get off ? 
 Thank you . 
 That's all for now . How much do I owe you ? 
 Can't you make it a little cheaper ? 
 OK . I understand . Thank you . 
 Of course . 
 It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan . 

Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ? 
 Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east . 
 Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ? 
 Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there ! 
 Hold on , please . 
 Sorry , but she's out . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 Seventy cents a piece . 
 Sixty cents a piece . 
 Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . 
 Thank you very much and anything else ? 

May I help you ? 
 Certainly . These are thirty yuan each and these are twenty-five . 
 How about these ? They are nine yuan each . 
 Not at all . 
 Anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . 
 This one is the same size and color . But the design is different . 
 Do you have any blue shirts ? 
 I'm not familiar with American size . 
 It's pretty . May I try it on ? 
 Thank you . 
 Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . 
 The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . 
 Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding . 
 Maybe . But it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . I'm getting to like the game more and more . 
 These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? 
 That's too much ! 
 I don't know . What do you want to do ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . 
 An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . 
 Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . 

What kind of permanent would you like to have ? 
 Oh , we have quite a regular , cold perm , straight perm , pin curl and foam . 

I think Yoga might be suitable for me . 
 Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . 
 I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . 

What are you waiting for ? Get on that bus quickly . 
 On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board . 

Do you carry black ink ? 
 I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink . 
 Well , I'll settle for blue-black . I'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes . 
 Give me a package of twenty , then . And where do I find shoelaces ? 
 Thank you . I never can find my way around this store . 

Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ? 
 That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar . 
 I don't care what others wear . How much is it ? 
 Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . 
 OK , anyway , let me have it . 
 Thank you . 
 The post office ? Sorry , I'm not sure . 

Next , please . Where to , sir ? 
 How many did you say , sir ? 
 That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you . 
 We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting . 
 How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . 
 And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity . 
 Fifth Avenue . 
 I should have ? 

Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . 
 You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . 
 Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . 

Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 
 Am I on right bus to Chicago ? 
 Oh , my God ! 
 I will . Thank you . 
 You can take the subway to get there . 
 It takes only ten minutes . 
 You can take No . I bus or a taxi . 
 Please turn right at the traffic lights . 

Excuse me , can you tell me where Main Street is ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

What's the fare , please ? 
 What ? You're overcharging me ! 
 Then something must be wrong with the meter . 
 Do you have this shirt in a small ? 
 May I try it on ? 

Do you think I should join the basketball team , Mary ? 
 But I'm afraid it'll take up too much of my time . 
 Hmm , you're right . 
 I'd like to speak to Michael Baker , please . 
 Yes.Tell him Mr.Cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back . 

Excuse me , could you lend me some of your records ? 
 Until Monday or Tuesday next week . 

I was wondering if you'd let me stay here for a few days . 
 Until next weekend , if that's OK . 
 I would if I could . 
 Yes , with pleasure . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Well , yes , there is something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . 
 Well , last night when I returned from the theatre , I found that I'd lost my wallet . 
 Well , some money . of course , my visa , all my identity cards and some photos . 
 Yes , I've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly . 
 Yes , quite sure . 
 But that takes too long . 

Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call . 
 No , I'll be right back . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 How's this ? 
 If you need any help , let me know . 
 How much is this pen ? 
 And how much is this pencil ? 
 Here's fifteen Yuan . 
 OK , that's right . 
 OK . 
 Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . 
 Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a look at the 2 - piece suit . 
 Middle size 
 Does this suit come in other color ? 
 How much is the brown one ? 
 Then I'll take it . 
 Yes . But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK , that is reasonable . I will take it . 
 Where was it from ? 
 Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? 
 This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . 
 It must be most precious . 

Show me a smaller pair of trousers , sir . I am not that fat , you see . 
 I have no idea . Measure me , please . 
 ( After trying ) I'm afraid it's still too fight around the stomach . 
 ( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ? 
 A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan . 

Can you help me find my books ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you . 
 Mmmm ... , it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess like skating better . 
 No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful . 

Here . Keep the change . 
 You're welcome . By the way , is there a pay phone near here ? 
 Yes , I do . Thank you . 
 I think we can have a try . 
 I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? 
 Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ? 

Where do these flower vases come from ? 
 Are they breakable ? 
 No wonder it's so expensive . 
 You have so many antiques and Chinese paintings here . May I have a look first ? 
 Are they genuine ? 

May I help you ? 
 Premium or regular ? 
 Anything else , sir ? Should I check the water and the oil ? 

May I help you find something , or are you just looking ? 
 Then take your time , please . 

Ouch ! I'm hurt . 
 Yes . I'm OK . I just had a tumble . No big deal . 
 Sorry . Can you please help me up ! I have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on . 
 Yes . I tried skiing on grass before . Not very good at it , though . 
 I'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans . 
 Adidas . Size 38 . 
 Yes . ( After trying ) A bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . Have you got a larger pair . Size 39 ? 
 ( After trying ) Mm , this pair fits me well . I'll take it . How much is it ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 You say how high can be exciting ? 
 I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . 
 Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . 
 If you don't mind , I'd rather you didn't . I have a cold and feel chilly . 
 I'd appreciate it if you would . 

Are you being served , sir ? 
 Will you sit here , please ? How would you like it cut ? 
 But it's short already , sir . 
 Shall I just trim it ? 
 Oh , I see . You like the Chinese style , don't you ? 
 Would you like to have a shampoo , sir ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 
 There ! How is that ? 

What's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ? 
 Yes . Five one-dollar stamps , please . 

Excuse me . You can't leave your car here . 
 I'm afraid you'll have to find a parking meter . 
 No , sir . I'm sorry you can't . 
 I suppose so . A haircut , please . 
 I'd just like a trim , and don't cut it too short . 
 I think they only need a little trimming . 
 No , don't use them , please . 
 Would you trim off a bit more there , above the ear ? 
 I guess that would be better . 
 No , not that much . Now , yes , that's fine . 
 Yes . 

Three twenty-five cent stamps , please . 
 And please send this letter by registered mail . 
 There's a check for two hundred dollars and a photograph . 
 No , don't bother . 

How can I help you ?

 Our foundation is of very super quality . We only use the finest ingredients . It will moisturize your skin and it can protect your skin from UVA and UVB .

 Of course . But I suggest you buy a lipgloss . The shining effect is in . 
 45 Yuan . If you buy the two , you can get a small bottle of nail polish for free . 

Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ? 
 You should ! This thrift shop is really cheap , though , you have to pay cash here . 

How did you get it ? 
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 
 Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . 
 Air mail or surface mail ? 
 Please put it on the Scale there . Seventy five cents . 
 Oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . Thank you . 
 You might send it as'Printed Matter ' . 
 Of course . How much would you want to insure these books for ? 
 Five hundred dollars , so you pay ten dollars for the insurance , that's two percent of the total value of the article . 

If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places . 
 Huh ! I am really out-of-shape , Why aren't you out-of-breath ? 
 How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way . 

I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . 
 Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . 
 Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . 
 I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . 

Does this TV work well ? 
 Is it a color TV or a black and white TV ? 

Hi , is that Mr . Wu ? 
 I am calling to query about some of your information . 
 I said I want to ask about some of your information . 

( Bob groans . ) What's the matter.Bob ? 
 What happened ? 
 Can you stand ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital for an X-ray . 
 It may be worse than it seems . How's it feel ? 
 Someone will be out to take a look any minute now . 
 Of course ! It's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . Will we have to wait much longer ? 

In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . 
 Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . 
 It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' 
 You can have a bird view of Chilin City from the top of the mountain . 
 You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the coming . 
 ... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky . 
 I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . 
 I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ? 
 I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian . 
 Does it have enough lodging ? 
 There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . 
 Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' . 
 If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you . 

Would you please weigh this letter to see what the postage is ? 
 By ordinary air mail , please . 
 A postal order for four hundred dollars . 
 Will I be informed when my friend gets the letter ? 
 All right , I'll have it registered , then .

Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
 I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . 
 We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . 
 Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? 
 I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? 

May I help you ? Miss ! 
 What color set do you prefer ? 
 We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors . Aren't they beautiful ? 
 If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though . 
 Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it . 
 Sure . Are you wearing any make-up ? 
 Have a seat , please . Now , here is the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 Try the lipstick as well . See , how fresh and charming you look . 

The central Hotel , please . I have to be there by 6:00 . 
 Yes . I've never been here before . 
 No , I'm open to suggestions . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Thanks a lot . Here's ten yuan . Keep the change . 
 What does it do ? 
 Wow ! What else does it do ? 
 Cool ! Anything else ? 
 Wow ! 
 Man , that's amazing . It must have cost a bundle . 

Good afternoon ! Where to ? 
 You are going to Tian'anmen Square . No problem . 
 Around 20 minutes , but it all depends on the traffic . 
 By this time , it's better . The rush hour is over . 
 Sure thing . Here we are . 
 Eight yuan twenty cents . 
 Thank you . Have a nice day . 

Have you ever climbed the mountain before ? 
 Now your dream comes true . Do you know the altitude of the mountain ? 

How much further do we have to walk ? 
 Shall we have a rest here ? I am tired out . 
 Good idea . So we Can rest in the shadow of the tree . 
 I'll be with you in a second . Uh ... Yes , ma'am ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . May I ask what you ordered again ? 

What will you have ? 
 Which do you prefer , meat or fish ? 
 Then why don't you try the Chef's Steak Special ? 

I would like to place an order . 
 I have your catalog here . Do you want me to tell you the item numbers , or the names ? 
 Alright . I want to order the satin sheets on page 28 . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 I need one full set of sheets in King-size . 
 Ivory , please 
 Yes , I think so . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm a foreigner here . My English isn't perfect . Can you tell me what satin is ? 
 I see . That's what I thought . 
 No , I just need the sheets . 
 Yes . 
 Visa . 
 8825 1127 4235 9869 . 
 July , 2006 . 
 Thank you . 
 Where are you heading , sir ? 
 What's your flight time ? 
 I guess we should get there no later than 7:00 . 
 Well , since it's rush hour , I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes , more or less.Is that okay ? 

Good morning . 
 May I take your order ? 
 How would you like your egg ? 
 All right , sir . 
 Well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports . 
 Using MP3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your CD player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk . 
 You can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 D mode and Mega Bass features . We rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones . 
 It's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip . 
 What have you got this morning ? 
 I'd like to have a glass of tomato juice , please . 
 Yes , a dish of cream of wheat . 
 Yes , bacon and eggs with buttered toast . I like my bacon very crisp . 
 Fried , please . 
 No , that's enough . T hank you . 
 It's simple . You can use call transfer . 
 Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . 
 Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . 
 In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . 
 No , I am afraid we don't . 
 No , thanks . We'll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ? 
 Bruce . By the way . Can we have a table by the window ? 
 That's fine . 
 May I have some water , please ? 
 With my dinner , please . And can you take my order for dessert later ? 

May I take your order ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . I thought you had one . Here you are . 
 I'm afraid we don't . But I'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special . 
 Yes , I'd like to book a table for four at seven this evening . 
 Yes . Mike Lee . And put me as close as possible to the stage , please . 
 Yes , please . I'm looking for a sofa . 
 May it be used as a sofa in the day and a bed during the night ? 

Good morning , can I help you ? 
 Here are several sets of furniture , including sofa , dressing table , wardrobe , and sideboard . How about this one ? 

Excuse me . Can you direct me to the toy department , please ? 
 Can you direct me to the elevator ? 
 Thank you . 

Can I order take-out here ? 
 Then could I have four orders , please ? 
 Will it take long ? 

Hello , my name's David Wong . I've ordered a sofa from you last Wednesday . I wonder when it will be delivered today . 
 It's 45132 . 

Can you offer me something a little cheaper ? 
 I want to stay under $ 20 . 

Excuse me . 
 I bought this circulator here yesterday but it doesn't work . 

Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for ! 
 Oh , I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ? 
 That's sheer robbery ! 
 It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ? 
 Shall we make it 250 dollars ? 
 What about 260 dollars ? 
 It's a deal . 
 No , thank you . I'm just looking . Maybe later I might need your help . 
 Oh , you do ? You certainly have a large selection . 
 No , you're going the wrong way . You want a 103 from Beijing Zoo . 
 You get off at the next stop , cross the street , and you'll find the stop not far on the right hand side . 
 Here you are . 

Did you check before you left the shop ? 
 Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one . 

Excuse me , but could you tell me if this bus goes to the National History Museum ? 
 I see . Where do I have to change then ? 
 How far is it ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 

Excuse me . What time does the next bus for Boston leave ? 
 I see . Are there any seats available ? 
 Good . How much is a one-way ticket ? 
 All right . Here's 40 dollars . 
 Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 

What's the quickest way to get there ? 
 Can you tell me where the taxi stand is ? 
 Thank you . 

Stand back from the door , please . There're plenty of seats in the rear . 
 One yuan fifty cents . Drop it in the box here . 
 Take a No . 2 . This is No . 12 . 
 Then this is the right bus . Move on , please . You're holding up the passengers . Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one . 

Where will it be ?

 Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? 
 OK . Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . 
 Well , I use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun . 
 To the right . 
 Looks good . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 There is a supermarket in Kensington High Street . I'll come and give you a hand . 
 Here , take one of these trolleys . What do you want exactly ? 
 The fruit and vegetables are over there . 
 Over there . 
 I'd like a trim . 
 No , thanks . 
 Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears . 

I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . 
 My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . 
 Does that make any difference ? 
 Are they designed differently ? 

This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . 
 What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? 
 Faulty products ? 
 Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . 
 That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . 
 Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . 
 I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? 

You're looking very well . 
 Do you often exercise ? 
 What style of swimming do you like best ? 
 I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . 
 Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . 
 I'd like extra prints made of these photos . 
 Yes . Here they are . I've marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
 Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . 

Welcome to Flash Foot . What can I do for you , ma'am ? 
 What size prints would you like ? 
 All right , ma'am , they'll be ready for you in an hour . 
 It depends on your height and body type . 
 By warming up before and cooling down after your workout . 
 Well , it's completely changed my life . 
 Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach . 
 Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . 

Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? 
 We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? 
 How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . 
 Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . 
 Take a look at this dress . Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? 
 Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . 
 One pound and fifty pence a pound . 
 Here it is . Four pounds and fifty pence in all . 
 What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . 
 Very sweet . 
 These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each . 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . 
 Thirty dollars . 
 If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . 
 That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? 
 Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . 

I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . 
 Not really . It pinches my toes . 
 I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . 

You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? 
 Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? 
 Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? 
 How's it going on ? 
 I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to buy a watch . 
 Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ? 
 Oh . I don't think I can afford that . How about this one ? 
 Wow . That's too much for me . Don't you have anything cheaper ? 
 By credit card . 
 Do you take American Express ? 
 Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are . 

What'll it be today , sir ? 
 Shall we check your oil and tires ? 
 ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . 

Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . 
 Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . 
 Right here . 
 Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . 
 Thank you . 
 What's the price of the bread ? 
 And how much is the coca cola ? 
 Here is ten Yuan . 
 Thank you . 

That's $ 60 in all . 
 Sure . You can go to the front desk to ask for more help . 

Excuse me , can I order now , please ? 
 I'd like the lasagna , please . 
 I'll try the vegetarian , please . 
 Of course . 
 I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch . 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter . 
 May I have a look at your passport , please ? 
 You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . 
 I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... 
 Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . 
 Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . 
 Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . 

How do you feel ? 
 Here is the bigger size . 

Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? 
 With or without ice , sir ? 
 Would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( Pouring soda ) 
 Enjoy your drink , sir . 
 Cats chase mice , don't they ? 
 Do you have to walk a cat ? 
 But then you have to change the litter box . 

Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ? 
 Certainly , a beer . Here you are , sir . 
 Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house . 
 You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy . 
 More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down . 

Hi . Can I help you ? 
 Okay . Please let me know if you need any help . 

Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? 
 Which bus do I have to change ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! 
 I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? 
 So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? 
 Like this ? 
 Did I do it right ? 
 What should I do with my legs then ? 
 Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? 

Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ? 
 Is it far from here ? 
 How far is it ? 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Is it close to the subway station ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , you get off at the square . 
 Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . 
 Drop 50 cents in the box , please . 
 Sure . I will . 
 Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it . 
 It's only about 10 minutes ' walk . 

Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? 
 You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . 
 Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? 
 All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . 
 Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . 
 Indeed , you're exactly right ! 
 Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do . 
 Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . 
 It could also help you increase vital capacity . 
 You will make it if you persist in it . 
 I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . 
 I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? 
 Do you think it will suit me ? 
 Ok , I'll have it for a change . 
 I'd be glad to . What is it ? 
 Hi . I ’ m Tom Peterson . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Well , between $ 350-400 a month . 
 I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . 
 As soon as possible . 
 Fine . 
 I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . 
 Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? 
 That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it . 
 We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . 
 Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . 
 You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . 
 Wo will deliver the goods to you for free .

Hi , I'd like to have a beer . 
 I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ? 
 Sounds good . I'll take that . 
 Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . 
 On the rocks , please . 
 Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's 30 . Keep the change . 

Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . 
 Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? 

What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? 
 But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 
 So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? 
 How about drinking soda ? 
 That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 
 How do you know so much about food and dieting ? 

I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . 
 If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . 

Hi , Mark . 
 All right . 
 This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . 
 Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . 
 Sure . A check will be fine . 
 Yes . 

Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 From 200 to 800 . 
 No problem . 
 I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' 
 Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . 
 No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . 
 Anytime . 
 That ’ s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . 
 Yes . 
 That wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode ! 
 To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done . 
 No way . It ’ s her who should apologize . 
 I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day . 
 Thanks for your understanding .

If there ’ s nothing damaged , we ’ ll give you back one month ’ s rent when you move out . You ’ ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ? 
 Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ’ t get your deposit back . 
 You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . 

Hello , Jenny . What's the matter ? 
 No problem , Jenny . Are you sure five hundred is enough ? 

Yes , sir ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 You should telephone the garage for help . 
 With pleasure . Get in . 

I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ? 
 Oh , that's great . Thank you very much .

Can I trouble you for some change ?

 OK , thanks . 
 I am sorry . It's not allowed . You have to wait till the next station . 
 Can you please slow down ? I am not in a hurry . 

Good afternoon , madam . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station . 
 Don't mention it . It is my duty . 

Good afternoon , can I help you ? 
 How many and what kind ? 
 Anything else ?

 You are welcome .

Good morning . What can I do for you ?

 OK . Here are your receipt and your change . 
 Bye .

 Not too rare . 
 Why do you come back again ? 
 What's that ? 
 Thanks , thanks a lot and thanks a million . 
 I can't forget about this when next time . 
 No , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ? 
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! 
 I know they aren't good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . 
 Yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? 
 What do we do first ? 
 Ok . Should I heat the wok ? 
 What about the chicken ?

 Just tell me what you'd like me to do .

 When will it be available ? 
 I like it a lot but I need to talk with my wife . Can you hold it for me for two days ?

 Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? 

I want to lose some weight ! 
 I have a yoga class tomorrow . Do you want to come with me ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Good , I am sure it will work if you can persist . 
 Sounds good ! 
 Well , I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 No . And on the contrary , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
 I said it ’ s a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! Rest breads rust . 
 I hope it won't be too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 OK ! See you later ! 
 Hi . What ’ s up ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll ask my plumber to come by and fix it today . What else ? 
 What ’ s the matter with it ?

 Anyway , we are arriving at Danshui soon . I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset .

 I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . 
 You should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! 
 I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? 
 That ’ s better . Now what ? 
 The tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . 
 I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . 
 Why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? 
 eyes , you sent them to New York , right ? 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 We have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . 
 Yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . 
 The prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? 
 Here you go . 
 Are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ? 
 We've got plenty to choose from here . 

Hello , can I help you ? 
 What dress size do you wear ? 
 This dress is the latest fashion form Paris . It ’ s made of pure silk . And this silk blouse would go with this skirt . Do you like it ? 
 Why don ’ t you try it on and see how you feel about it ? 
 How does that feel ? 
 You look wonderful . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Hi , Steven . What's new with you ? 
 Why ? 
 What happened ? Did you have a fight ? 
 I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ? 
 It's a problem . You'd better move . 
 Let's take the bus . 
 It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
 We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . 
 If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? 
 I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
 It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
 See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !

 Thank you . 
 Yes , I am after some sugar . 
 Can you show me the way , please ? 

Oh , dear . My weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 Sure , I used to work there . Go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . The mall will be on the right . 
 Yes , the address is 541 Main street . 
 No problem . 
 No , that way is longer . There are more stop lights on that street . 

Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .

 I have to wear it this afternoon . Do you have a urgent service ?

 I'm very sorry . Can I get you another one ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 Let me have a look . Oh , the watch ’ s battery is worn down . 
 $ 50 . 
 About 2 years . 

Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend ? 
 Please excuse me for what I said just now . What do you think of this one ? 
 Sorry . It is the smallest size we have . 
 Oh , yes . There is a big one at the right corner of the street . Perhaps you will get one there . 

Hello , ma ’ am . Can I help you ? 
 What size are you looking for ? 
 How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you . 
 Sure . The fitting room is on your right . 
 You look pretty in red . 
 $ 29.99 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 They are in aisle 5 . 

Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . 
 My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . 

Good afternoon.can I be of any assistance to you ? 
 Here are the suits . Which one would you like ? 

Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ? 
 How come so cheap ? 
 I ’ ll take one . And here is a dollar . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes ? How can I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Yes . The limit is four per family . 
 I know . This is a really good bargain . 
 No problem . 
 One dollar . 
 Actually , you can only have four . 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 Why ? You said I was hot when smoking . 
 Smoking is killing . I know . 
 I don ’ t believe it . 
 Of course I know it , but you know it's hard to quit smoking ... 
 Yes , ma'am . Whatever you say . 
 Not yet . I am looking for a black suitcase . 
 Yes . I would prefer Nike . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . You will save 90 cents on each bag . 
 No , no limit . You can take as many as you want . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Take your mind off it . Look , Crys.This magazine is on China's top ten beauties ! 
 She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face . 
 Not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that . 
 Look at this girl's gray dress . 
 Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade . 
 So why are you dieting this time anyway ? Another guy ? 
 The girls in this magazine are so slender . 
 True.You know , I First started dieting when I was ten . 
 Oh , no . Too much work . I hate to sweat . It's so gross . 
 I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms . 
 I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster . 
 Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos . 
 I want a shirt . 
 Well , do you have the same in black ? 

Are you looking for something special ? 
 Follow me , please . How do you like this one ? 
 Levis . It's the latest fashion . 
 Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available . 
 Sure , go ahead . 

My stomach's growling again ! 
 Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ? 
 You're right . But if I get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again . 
 You know . Soup , well , society makes us like this . 
 Well , thin is always " in " with the media . 
 if you aren't thin , you're nobody . 
 You lost me . 
 Yeah , but that's human nature . 
 Let's change the stomach , I mean , the subject.How about some food ? 
 Yes , do you have sweaters ? 
 You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles . 
 Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? 
 If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? 

I am looking for a blouse . Can you show me the way , please ? 
 I have no idea . Could you recommend me one ? 
 Well , the style is quite good , but I think it's too showy . I would like to try on the lighter one . 
 I want to buy one to match my shirt.Can you give me some advice ? 
 Yes , they seem to be my size and go with my shirt quite well . I will take it . 
 Yes , what style do you prefer ? 
 OK , here you are . 

Would you please bring me the black suit ? I want to try it on . 
 I think this suit fits perfectly . 
 It's fine . Please wrap it . 
 Yes , I want to buy a suit . 
 Yeah , it's quite cute . I don't think it will fit me . I would prefer a darker color . Have you a black one ? 

Check the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 I think this one fits you . It's the new fashion style . 

Well , this is not quite the style I want . Have you any suit in fashion ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 This is much better . How much is it ? 
 You need to make posters ? 
 I see . Then let's make a shoppinglIist first before we go there.othe rise , It may take us a whole day to search for the things you need . 
 Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon . 
 Oh , yes . You are so smart . I see them . So I have to go to shelf number 3 first to get my markers , color pencils and highlighters and somebrushes . 
 It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses . 
 I am looking for a pair of trousers . Do you have any good ideas ? 
 I don't like it . Actually I am looking slacks . 
 It seems all right . Do you have pantaloons ? 
 It must come from the bakery on the corner.They are baking cookies . Their cookies are very popular in town . 
 I think so . The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA . He is good at making cookies . 
 Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one . 
 I am starting loving this bakery now . 
 You should have told me earlier . I am a cookie lover . 
 Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . 
 Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . 
 My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . 
 You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . 
 His name is Bingo . 
 We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away . 
 Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . 
 I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? 
 Really ? Why is that ? 
 Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park . 
 OK , how was everything ? 
 Would you like this to-go ? 
 Sure , no problem . Here you are . That'll be 25 dollars . 
 Yes , we accept Visa and MasterCard . 
 Thanks . I'll be right back . 
 Here's your receipt . 
 You're welcome . Please come again . 
 Sure . Where should I put this cup ? 
 The red one . 
 How about this fruit ? 
 And those pencils ? What should I do with them ? 
 How about this pen ? 
 What do you want me to do with that paper over there ? 
 The trash is full . 
 OK . Now what ? 
 Sure . 
 What color do you like ? 
 Maybe you could have a look at this one . 
 Large . 

If you like you can try it on.The fitting room is in the corner . 
 I think it fits you . It flatters your figure . 

May I try this on ? 
 What material is it made of ? 
 That's good.Cotton is soft and flexible . 
 Yes , I am looking for a skirt . What's in fashion now ? 
 Well . Could I try it on ? 
 ( A moment later ) It's cute.The color suits my complexion . 
 I am Looking for a T-shirt . 
 What kind of material is this ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . 
 Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . 
 See , he's wagging his tail . 

What's the latest fashion of evening gown ? 
 I would like to try on one in violet . 
 Thank you . Do you have some other colors ?

Where do you want to go ? 
 Get in . I will take you there . 
 $ 50 . 
 Ye , of course . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 You have really good taste . It's the best seller right now . 
 Sure . 

The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? 
 That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? 
 Yeah . I think I can find it . 
 That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . 
 Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . 

Now , madam , here is the Hotel . 
 $ 15 . 
 Well , madam , the meter was not on at all . You didn't tell me . 

Excuse me , driver . Let me off here , please . 
 I have just changed my plan . 
 Here is the fare and keep the change please . 
 No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package . 
 OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days . 
 It's 500 dollars . 
 Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here . 
 You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address . 
 Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days . 
 OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you . 
 I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . 
 Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? 

Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? 
 Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? 

It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . 
 Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . 
 Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? 
 They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . 
 If you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn . 
 Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . 
 There are different types . Which one do you like best ? 
 Surely , of course . 
 It's there , near the mirror . 
 I am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it . 
 OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain . 
 Yes , could you give me some ideas ? 
 Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it . 
 Sure.the fitting room is right behind you . 
 Sure , wait a moment . 
 The dress is made on your measurement . 
 OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow . 
 I am going to the gym . Do you want to come with me ? 
 Then , I'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes . 
 Do you have your member card with you ? 
 Well I have a guest ticket . You can use it . 

I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ? 
 My laptop , do you see it ? 
 Where's my book ? 
 The dictionary . 
 Where's my pencil ? 
 That's not a pencil . That's a pen . 
 How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ? 
 Where are my shoes ? 
 I don't see them . 
 Thanks . 

This one is too small . Please bring me a bigger one . 
 What's the brand ? 
 This one suits better . I will take it . 
 Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? 
 What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit . 

Could I be of any help to you ? 
 Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well . 
 What about the divided skirt ? 

Do you have the same in different sizes ? The trousers are too long for me . 
 Will the trousers shrink when washed ? 
 That's good . I will take it . 
 About 6 in the morning . I like to walk to the office . 
 About 20 minutes . Do you live alone ? 
 How old is she ? 
 I think so . 
 I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . 
 I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
 Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 How about As Long as You Love Me ? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! 

I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! 
 At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . 
 Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . 
 Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . 
 Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . 
 Certainly . What's your size ? 
 They are all leather . How do they feel ? 

Try it on in front of the mirror . 
 We have darker ones . Do you like the style ? 
 lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water . 
 If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! 
 Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . 
 Hey ! Where are you going ... ? 

Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers . 
 Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious . 
 Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it . 
 Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it . 
 Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you . 
 Be patient . Good food never comes fast . 

Hi , is you , John ? 
 Sorry , John . I suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day . 
 I know , I left it at home . 
 It's OK now . Don't worry , John . 
 For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . 
 Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . 
 Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . 
 You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? 

Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes . 
 Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ... 
 I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube . 
 Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ? 

Do you have cheongsams ? 
 The styte is OK . Which country is this made in ? 
 Please wrap it . 
 I would like to see your summer suits . 
 Will it wash well and the color won't fade ? 

Do you want to buy a sweater ? 
 The cowl-neck pullovers are new in . It sells like hot cakes . 
 Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality . 
 Yes , I am looking for a coat . 
 I have no idea . 
 Well , it's good in style , but I am afraid it doesn't wash well . 
 Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ? 
 Will it shrink when washed ? 

Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ? 
 Let's just get both . Do you bring enough money ? 

Could I speak to Mr . Wu , please ? 
 This is Kevin . 

This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture . 
 Do you have a bed ? 
 That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room . 
 Yeah . By the way , can I take a shower ? 
 Really ? 
 Well , do you want to go outside for dinner ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 Glad to meet you . This way , please . 
 But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby . 

Hello . Manchester 6739792 . 
 Nicholas ? Nicholas Nickleby ? No . He doesn't live here any more . He's moved to Morecambe . 
 Yes . I've got it somewhere . Let me see . Where did I put it ? Ah - I remember , it's on the memo . Here it is . Do you have a pen to write it down ? 
 His number's 4945939 . 

Slow down ! You can't exceed the speed limits . 
 No , you can not . It is dangerous . 
 No . You shouldn't drive like that . 
 My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
 What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 When do you have lunch ? 
 What do you normally eat ? 
 Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . 

( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? 
 As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? 
 But you look quite proficient in using them now . 
 Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow ! 
 Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . 

Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Don't drive too fast . 
 Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast . 
 That's better . 
 I think so . 
 Well , on weekdays I get up around ten . Then I read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon . 
 I start work at three . 
 I get home pretty late , around midnight . 
 I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT ! 

Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . 
 No , the yellow ones . 
 Well , that necklace isn't bad . 
 That blue one right there . How much is it ? 
 Hey , let me get it for you . It's your birthday present . 
 I need the police . 
 My neighbor hit my brother on the head . He ’ s bleeding . 
 176 Wooden Street East . 
 I will , but please hurry . 

Mum , pass me some more please ! 
 But the ads say they're most nutritious . 

Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman . 
 No , I'm not asking for money , I'm asking for your advice . 

Will you look at this form ? 
 I don't understand some things . 
 What does MI mean ? 
 What does MM / DD / YY mean ? 
 I don't understand . 
 Oh . That's simple enough . 

Let's go to the animal shelter . 
 I want to get a puppy for my son . 
 I'll get him one of those little dogs . 
 And eat too much . 
 Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked . 
 He wanted to take it home yesterday . 

Stand back from the door , please . Let the passengers off . You can't get on until the other passengers get off . 
 One dollar . Drop it in the box . Move to the rear of the bus . There are plenty of seats in the rear . 
 That's right.Move along , please.There are more people waiting to get on.Move to the rear . 
 No , that's the number l that goes down Park Avenue.This is the number 2 . 
 It is.Get in.please.You ' re holding everyone up.You can't miss Washington Square Park . 
 It would be better if you watched out for yourself . I might forget . 
 Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . 
 No . And then I often go Rollerblading . 
 About five times a week . What about you ? 

What shall we do tonight ? 
 That's a good idea . We haven't seen a film for ages . What would you like to see ? 
 Titanic ? That old film ? but I've seen it before ! 
 Why is that ? 
 Yes , the snow is fun . 
 How big was it ? 
 How long did it take ? 
 Did you give him a nose ? 
 Let me help you make one this year . 
 What do you need to do ? 
 How are you going to do that ? 
 What's that ? 
 It gives you money ? 
 And it gives you money ? 
 Oh . What good is that ? I thought it gave you free money . 
 Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ? 
 No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself . 
 The whole-wheat loaf is 45 cents , the white loaves are 35 cents each , the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each . That makes two dollars fifty-seven cents . 
 Thank you , ma'am . Forty-three cents change . Have a nice day . 
 Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia . 
 I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ? 
 It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ? 
 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry . 

What channel did you watch last night ? 
 How do you feel about it ? 
 Well , I don't think much about it . To me , it's a sheer waste of time 
 Variety shows and talk shows , I think . 
 Yes , I am . 
 It's a quarter to eight . I'm going to work . 
 I'm working on Saturday mornings this month.Are you getting up ? 
 OK . See you at noon . 

Excuse me . May I see that laptop for a moment ? 
 No , the one on the left . Yes , that ′ s the one . ... Thank you . 
 That ′ s impressive ! What ′ s the sale price ? 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Any particular colour ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ? 
 Why , of course . Let's see ... White ... Pale yellow . Here you are , sir . 
 Yes , I am , thank you . I'll have three scrambled eggs with country ham , toast and jam , please . 
 I'll have a tomato juice and some iced tea . 
 Could I have a slice of pumpkin pie ? 

Yes , ma'am ? 
 Air mail or surface mail ? 
 That'll be eighty-five cents . 
 Three dollars and forty cents . 

Can you help me , please ? Is there a public restroom near here ? 
 Oh , no ! ! My son needs a bathroom . 
 Where on Grant Street ? 
 Thank you very much . 

It's time for your bath , young lady . 
 You need a bath every day . 
 Because you don't want to smell bad . 
 That's what you think . 
 I can smell you . 
 That's my perfume . 

Yikes ! What was that noise ? 
 Did you have to blow right next to the phone ? 
 Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house . 
 I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see . 
 I thought you had an elephant in your house . 
 What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf . 

Hi , welcome to Hal's Computer World . Can I help you with anything ? 
 No problem . First of all , do you want to get a home computer or a laptop ? 
 Yes , they generally cost a little more . 

I called HP about my computer . 
 They said I need a new hard drive . 
 It's not too much , only about $ 85 . 
 No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . 
 Yes , it's just a couple of screws . 
 It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . 

I'm going to take a nap . 
 That's a good idea . 
 No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up . 
 Okay . I think I'll be awake by then . 
 You mean I will smell the food cooking ? 
 I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired . 

Something's wrong with my computer . 
 All I get is a black screen . 
 I think I know , because this happened before . 
 My hard drive crashed . 
 It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . 
 No , I always back up my files . 

Do you want an IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh ? 
 Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ? 
 Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more . 
 I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ? 
 This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ? 
 Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one . 
 Good idea . I'll get some , too . 
 Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays . 
 No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades . 

What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . We also eat mutton . 
 That's right . Mutton chops taste so good . We eat them with sauce . Have you ever tried ? 
 Certainly I can . I'll buy some from the butcher's and cook for you next Sunday . 

So are you going to get a new swimsuit ? 
 Why don't you get a bikini ? 
 You aren't fat . I'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . How about this thong bikini ? 
 I guess that one-piece isn't too bad , either . ( to be continued ) 
 Does it come with a modem ? 
 How about the monitor ? 
 That's okay . A 15 - inch is good enough . All right , I'll take it . 
 Ready for what ? 
 What are you talking about ? 
 Oh . Of course I'm ready . 
 No , I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV . 
 It was only about $ 120 for a 13 - inch screen . 
 Oh , yes . I get six Korean channels but nothing in English ! 
 Yeah , I do . I guess I'm a real fitness freak . 
 Well , I do aerobics every day after work . And then I play racquetball . 
 Oh , do you want to play sometime ? 
 Pretty well , I guess . 
 No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard . 
 No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . 
 I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . 
 Excuse me . I will go to Wangfujing , where should I get off ? 
 We are arriving at Tiananmen . Please get ready for your arrival . 
 No , sir . The next stop is Wangfujing . 
 Please get ready . 
 We are arriving at Wangfujing . Please get ready . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . I'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please . 
 Yes . I'll have a mixed green salad . 
 Italian , please . 
 Yes , I'd like a large soda , please . 
 He's a bright boy , isn't he ? 
 Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step . 
 Oh , no . I forgot . 
 What time does the recycle truck come by ? 
 I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Do you think I'll forget to do it ? 
 Okay , I'll take it out front right now . 
 Oh . Yes ? 
 Yes , there are some on Pine Street . 
 Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center . 
 By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too . 

Is this the right bus for San Francisco ? 
 When's the first stop ? 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed . 

Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? 
 Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . 
 I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . 
 Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . 
 Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . 
 Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . 
 Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . 
 Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . 
 Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . 
 Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' 
 cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? 
 is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . 
 of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal . 
 Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . 

Is your father in the habit of having naps ? 
 Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? 

When do you go to bed usually ? 
 That's helpful for your health . 

Are you ready , Pa ? 
 No . 

Let's see if we forget anything . 
 Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . 

Do you like the cookies ? 
 Glad you like it . 

I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ? 
 I'll be back in ten days . 
 What's going on ? 
 More and more people easily get irritated while driving . 

Good evening , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ? 
 Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish . 
 We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again . 
 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . 
 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . 
 That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health . 
 But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! 
 I mean you couldn't give it up ! 
 150 pounds . 
 I can't bear eating less . 
 Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise . 
 No , but I am starting working out from now on . 

Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? 
 Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . 

I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . 
 You've formed a sound habit . 

Excuse me , ma'am ? 
 I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . 

You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? 
 Aren't you tired ? 

Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? 
 Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? 
 Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? 

I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ? 
 No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . 
 Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue . 
 Bye ! I'll be back before seven . 
 Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . 
 You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? 
 Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? 
 Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? 

I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday . 
 Yes , that would be good ! 
 If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . 
 Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . 
 Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . 

In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . 
 Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . 
 Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . 
 Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . 
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . 
 A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . 
 I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 
 You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . 
 It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . 
 Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . 
 More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . 
 We have some fresh red roses . 
 Twenty dollars per dozen . 
 Yes , that is today's sale price . 
 Is there anything else you'd like to get ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 Yes . I would like to place a collect call . 
 Terry and his number is 4562325 8 . 

What reasons do westerners drink for ? 
 I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . 
 Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . 

Why are there so many people ? 
 Those people are quarrelling . 
 We have to find a shelter . 
 Let's go under the tree . 
 Then let's go to that store . 
 It's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . 
 She is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? 
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . 
 But I think they're dull , aren't they ? 
 Well , cats are certainly more independent . 
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? 
 Poor cat . 

Traffic rules are different among countries . 
 People drive on the right in China . 

How can we avoid the jam ? 
 OK . 

Usually cities have greater traffic problems . 
 I hate the car columns on the road . 

How do you get road news ? 
 So you have all the news on broadcast ? 

I can't find proper parking space . 
 No , there's no parking sign . 

Look , there is traffic accident over there . 
 The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . 
 It can ’ t be time to get up yet . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 My watch says ten past . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 
 ( And here is the seven o ’ clock news ) It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . 
 I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . 
 I notice there's a jam a few blocks away . 
 I'm afraid I'll be late . 
 Every five minutes . 
 It comes on the dot . 
 You have gone against the traffic rules . 
 Do you know this is a Onaway street ? 
 You have to pay a fine . 
 I think something must be done . 

Shit , so crowded ! 
 Things change every minute . 

How long do I have to wait ? 
 I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities . 

Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? 
 Why ? anything special there ? 
 Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? 
 That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . 
 Why not ? it's so cool . 
 Pardon ? 
 Well , I didn't realize that . 
 Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . 

Excuse me . Would you tell me where The People's Park is ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 I'm not going in the wrong direction , am I ? 
 May I take a bus to get there ? 
 OK . Thank you a lot . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! 

Do you like shopping ? 
 Why don't you do your shopping at home ? 
 I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . 

Oh , here comes a bus ! 
 How long have you waited ? 

I'll be late because I have waited so long ! 
 I'd better take a taxi . 

Oh , the bus is gone . 
 I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . 

Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? 
 Have you ever seen such a nice house ? 
 This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new . 

I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen . 
 It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . 
 It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . 
 What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . 
 Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds just wonderful to us . 
 How about this afternoon ? 

My dear , it's five flights up ! 
 We're little further away from the street and traffic noise 
 Is the place well-furnished ? 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . 
 The plumbing seems OK , too . 
 And the sinks don't seem to leak . 

Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 
 That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 
 True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . 
 Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not . 
 I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . 
 You're so careless , Billy . 
 I've done it for you . 
 An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? 
 Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . 
 That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . 
 That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? 
 Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . 
 Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ? 
 No , thanks . 
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . 
 I promise you'll have it tomorrow . 
 It is true . I think we should change some policies . 
 Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . 

Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ? 
 Here's the money.And get some salt . 

I can't believe that . 
 I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . 
 The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . 
 No , I'm not clear . 
 Don't make a fuss.The price is rising 
 I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . 
 Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . 
 Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? 
 That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! 
 Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . 
 They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . 
 Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? 
 How can you get that done ? 
 What else ? 
 Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 
 Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . 
 It's important to do proper exercises . 
 The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . 
 We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . 
 Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . 
 Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health . 
 You bet it ! 
 Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . 
 I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! 
 Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 
 I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . 
 Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . 

Have you ever tried shopping online ? 
 That's right . Seeing is believing . 
 That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . 
 It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . 
 Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . 

Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! 
 Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . 
 Me too . 
 Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? 
 He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . 

Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? 
 Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . 
 But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . 
 No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . 
 The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . 

Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 
 Really ? Do you often shop online ? 
 I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? 
 Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . 
 Well , are there any other advantages ? 
 Are there many choices of online shopping ? 
 Perhaps I should have a try . 
 There is so much information and I advise to read newspaper . 
 Yes , of course . If you like the room , call the landlord and confirm the information of the room . 

Do you like the room ? 
 $ 300 per month . 
 At the beginning of the month . Besides , you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit . 
 Yes . Right now I have a studio . 
 In the downtown , near the square . 
 Yes , and the rent includes utilities . 
 What about next saturday . 

Excuse me , where am I on this map ? 
 Which bus should I take to railway station ? 
 Where am I supposed to change ? 

Julia , what time is it ? 
 Oh , my God ! I'm going to be late ! I have no time to have breakfast now . ( Hurry on his clothes . ) 
 Oh , I have a poor memory now . I haven't had enough sleep lately . I had a bad dream just now . 
 Yes . I really need to have a good rest . 
 Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We've sightly overspent this month . 
 But I'm not sleepy , darling . I want to finish it today . 
 Okay . Good night . Have a good dream . 

You must be Mr.Sellers . I'm Steven . I am here to see the apartment you advertised . 
 Could I have a look at it first ? 
 It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom . 
 Is there air conditioning ? 
 What's the house rent ? When is the rent due ? And how much security deposit do you require ? 
 I like the apartment , Mr.Sellers . You can show me the lease . 
 University Street . 
 You'll see one at the corner on your right . 
 Sure . What's this for ? 
 What about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ? 
 Good idea . I was thinking the same myself . 

Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . 
 A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . 
 Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants . 
 Yeah , it's near a bus stop . 

Have you ever thought about your ideal home ? 
 What would it be like ? 
 How many rooms would it have ? 
 How many bathrooms would your dream home have ? 
 How would you decorate your house ? 
 How many TVs would your dream home have ? 

We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on . 
 Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . 
 Let's see . We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month . 
 We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . 
 Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ? 
 Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . 

Excuse me , can you tell me where central Park Street is ? 
 Is it far ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 

Excuse me , where is the nearest bank ? 
 Thank you . 
 Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . 
 No , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . 

Excuse me . Could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema ? 
 Will it take me long to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 

It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! 
 That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? 
 That would be lovely , thanks . 
 I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . 
 Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient . 
 Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . 
 I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help . 

Excuse me , ma'am . Can you tell me where the nearest postoffice is ? 
 Do you mean that I go that way for one block , then turn right ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 They are very nice , you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody's buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 

Excuse me , Is there a hotel nearby ? 
 how can I get there ? 

Can you tell me the way to library ? 
 Is it on Xinhua street ? 

Alright , tell me what you think . 
 Yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? 
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . 
 How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? 
 That ’ s even better than the real thing . 
 It ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! 
 Yes , of course.The dressing room is over there . 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 Speaking . 
 I ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It's 89 yuan . 
 Let me check . 
 Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . 
 Cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? 
 Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . 
 That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . 
 You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 
 Well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! 

Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ? 
 Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ? 
 ( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ? 
 Is it a long ride ? 
 OK . I know . Thank you . 

Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 
 Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . 
 That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . 
 I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . 
 Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . 
 When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . 
 Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 

Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? 
 Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . 
 I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing . 
 Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . 

Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? 
 Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? 
 Did someone get hurt ? 
 What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? 
 Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? 

Hello ! Is your taxi engaged ? 
 Please take me to the Honging Hotel . 
 Could you get there in twenty minutes ? 
 I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . I have a friend waiting for me . 
 Thanks . 
 You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . 
 What kind of errands do we need to run ? 
 I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . 
 Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . 
 Ok , let's go then ! 
 For what ? 
 You said you were only going to window shop ! 
 I should have known ... 
 I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock . 
 It's a quarter past three . 
 I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . 
 Really ? I thought you hated shopping ? 
 Sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on . 
 That ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? 
 I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? 
 This is perfect ! What do you think ? 
 I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! 
 I pay much attention to my daily diet . You know good eating habits help to fortify the body against disease . 
 I eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods . 
 I drink milk every day . It's really good for building strong bones and teeth . I drink tea quite often , for it's protective against kidney cancer . 
 You are what you eat , and a healthy diet creates a body resistant to disease . 
 You're welcome ! 
 Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . 
 I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . 
 Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . 
 Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? 
 I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! 
 I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . 
 I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . 
 No , I thought that would be included in the rent . 
 I don't think I can afford that . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary . 
 Is the security door useful ? 
 I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . 

Mr.Sellers ? It's Steven speaking , your tenant . We've just suffered a power failure.What should I do now ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 How do I know if it's blown out ? 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 OK , I'll try . I'll call you again if that doesn't work . 
 Turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom . 
 You are welcome . Hope you can find it soon . 
 It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . 
 No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . 
 No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . 
 That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . 
 Not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . 

Have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ? 
 So , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ? 
 How old is the house then ? 
 Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? 
 Do you have a big yard ? 
 Is your house well-lit ? 
 How many rooms does your house have ? 
 I'd be up for that ! 
 About 3 000 dollars . 
 I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . 
 Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income . 

Oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . 
 Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? 
 When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . 
 Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . 
 That's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . 
 Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . 
 It's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ? 
 I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home . 
 It ’ s about an hour ’ s drive . 
 I can ’ t promise , but I ’ ll do my best . 
 What's up ? 
 It is really good news . How much do you earn a week now ? 
 Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important . 
 I see . You must have more rest . 
 That depends . What is it ? 
 I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . 
 Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . 
 That'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? 
 See you then ! 
 Silk market . 
 Yes , That ’ s right . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 Thanks . Could you tell me where I should deposit my bag ? 
 OK . I will deposit my bag right now .

Where can I call a taxi ? 

Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Sure . Come to look at these styles . They sell very well . 
 How about these ? They are the current bestsellers . 
 Yes , I will find one for you . Here you are . It's made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft . 
 Yeah , this is the latest model.If you like it , you can try it on . 
 Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping . 
 Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work . 
 By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ? 
 Let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present . 

We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? 
 Let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? 
 I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . 
 Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? 
 What's in a dahl ? 
 That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? 
 That's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? 
 Ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? 
 You're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! 

Excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 
 That ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? 
 Can I buy stamps here ? 
 I need 30 for my Christmas cards . 
 Twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . 
 No . 
 And the bubble wrap ? 
 Thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
 You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ? 
 Here you are 
 It's just around the comer . 
 Yes . One moment , please . 
 6 500 yuan . You will get it on the price tag . 
 Its already very cheap . Let's make it 6 000 yuan . 
 Hum ... I say 5 500 yuan . That's as cheap as it can get . 
 I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price . 

Excuse me , how can I get special discount coupons ? 
 Can I get a discount coupon if I buy these goods ? 
 But how much discount can I get if I use it to buy goods next time ? 
 Can I buy everything in the supermarket by it ? . 
 How long can I keep it ? 
 I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . 

Hi , I want to check out . 
 Can I pay by a credit card ? 
 OK . Here is the money . 
 Would you wrap it for me ? 

Hi , welcome to Rental Property Management . How can I help you ? 
 Okay . Our rental agent will be with you in a moment .

 Okay , I'll go take a look . Thank you so much for your help . 

Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ? 
 How about Music Madness ? 
 Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post . 
 We may be sold out of them . Let me check the back . ( The clerk goes to the storeroom , returning a few minutes later . ) I'm afraid we're out of stock . Would you like a rain check ? 
 Let me get the manager to sign one for you . 
 Yes , I ’ m looking for a pair of trousers . 
 I ’ m a large .

 Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ? 
 Hmm ... This Rolex ? $ 1,000 . 
 This one is $ 500 . 

Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 .

 Medium , please . 
 Yeah . give me a chocolate bar also .

 No . I am sure about that . 
 Yes . This is your receipt . 
 It looks very nice and the food looks delicious . 
 Really ? 
 No , I haven ’ t . I have never eaten jellyfish before . 
 No , I have not and I ’ m not sure I want to try them now . 
 It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . 
 You're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . 
 Don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . 
 No , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . 
 Alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .

Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? 
 It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? 
 So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? 
 And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? 
 But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. 
 Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . 
 But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . 
 Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . 

Would you like this one ? 
 This one ? 
 This one is especially built for hard , continuous play . And every detail of workmanship and material has been carefully checked to make it a dependable one for tournament use . 
 This cover comes with the racket . 
 The mark says six hundred yuan , plus tax , it's six hundred and eighty yuan . 
 Sure . If you'll just wait here , I'll be right with you in a minute . 
 Yes , but can you show me the other colour ones ? 
 No , I don't like the brown one . 
 Good , I like it . 
 It is extremely beautiful.This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.Please put in a gift box for me . 

I'd like to buy a bottle of Centrum , a tooth brushes . 
 Give me one bottle of thirty tablets . 
 Can I have a look at them ? 
 Are they cheaper ? 

Wow , it all looks so good . I ’ m not sure what to choose . 
 Actually , I ate too much pork yesterday . I fancy a change . 
 That sounds like a good idea . It looks very big though . 

Thank you for bringing me here . What shall we order ? 
 Really ? I ’ d rather have the chicken feet to be honest . 
 How about drinks ? Would you like beer or wine ? 
 Wine ’ s fine by me . Let ’ s order a bottle of the house red then . 

I love Chinese food . 
 Well , I always order fried spring rolls when I go to Chinatown . 
 Really ? But they're delicious ! 
 That sounds great . 

Thank you for bringing me here Hong , this place looks great ! 
 Let me see . How about the lotus root ? 
 Oh , yes that would be nice . 
 Actually , I ’ m vegetarian so I ’ d like to have the bean curd . 

Mm ... How do I get this ticket machine to work ? 
 Ok , I ’ Ve done that . 
 Oh it ’ s printed the ticket already . Thank you very much . 

Hong , I really need to call back to the UK but I can ’ t afford to pay for the roaming charges . 
 Can I do that ? 
 I see . How much will that cost ? 
 Wow , that is cheap . Thank you very much . 
 Why don't you wear a scarf ? 
 You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough . 
 Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket . 
 I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own . 

Are you going somewhere ? 
 Really ? Well you ’ ll have to get there before 6pm because they close early today . 
 Yeah and remember if you buy something you mustn ’ t carry it home otherwise your back will get worse . 
 Yes , but it ’ s not free , you have to pay . 

Cindy , can you show me how to call Connecticut ? 
 A good friend of mine is there on a homestay program , too . 
 Is it expensive to make out-of-state calls ? 
 What do I do here ? 
 That's it ? 

Hi , there . Look at these . I have collected some ads here . There is a special promotion for Mother's Day this weekend . 
 Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's included in the gift package ? 
 Sounds not bad . 
 Oh really what ’ s happening ? 
 Ok but you must stay calm . Do you want me to give you a lift ? 
 Ok , wait one minute . I must remember where I left the keys . 
 I ’ ll have the kung PAO chicken , please . 
 Just some fried rice please . 
 No , thanks . 

Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? 
 What ' the matter ? 
 I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . 
 That's true . 
 It was good . I brought lunch from home today . 
 Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy . 
 Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ? 
 Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . 
 Yeah , it's hard to believe but true . 
 Oh no . I broke your vase accidentally . 
 I bumped it by accident , but I didn't mean to do it . 
 I feel miserable . Can I give you money for it ? 
 First I was late for school this morning , and now I broke your vase . This isn't my day ! 
 Why ? It looks like a sunny day . 
 What do you mean ? 
 But look , it's so sunny out . 

Lisa , can I call Taiwan ? 
 I miss my parents . 
 Can you show me how to make an overseas call ? 
 That's 886 . 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly , here you are . 
 Of course . It fits you perfectly . 
 It's forty-five yuan . 
 Sorry , our prices are set . 
 It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . 
 Oh , it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10.0 megapixels . It's got a 5xzoom , so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great ! I can change the resolution , too . 
 It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends . 
 No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese . 
 That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper . 
 Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight . 
 And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast . 
 I'll put the shopping basket back . 
 What does it do ? 
 Wow ! What else does it do ? 
 Cool ! Anything else ? 
 Wow ! 

Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ? 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then . 
 If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier . 
 See you tonight . 
 What is it , dear ? 
 You mean stuff like tampons and sanitary napkins ? 
 Follow me . All the things you need as a woman are in aisles 10 and 11 . This section is usually near the medicine section in any supermarket . 

Can I be of any service to you ? 
 There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ? 
 I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry . 

Good morning . what can I do for you ? 
 You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from . 
 Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ? 
 They're only three thousand yuan . 
 Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out . 
 You've made an excellent choice , sir . 
 Yes . I'd like to choose a sweater for my son . 
 Not yet . Can you give me some suggestions ? 
 Thirteen . 
 About 158cm . He likes to wear loose-fitting sweaters . 
 I don't think he'll like it . He prefers simple styles . 
 The style is all right , but I'm not sure about the color . Let me think for a while . 
 Absolutely . Here it is . 
 Please do , the fitting-room is over there . 
 I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? 
 It's 486 yuan . 
 I ’ d like a coffee please . 
 What have you got ? 
 Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ’ ll have a cappuccino please . 

This section of the store is called Junior . Why is that ? 
 But I can't find anything in my size here . 
 Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! 
 What's in the petite section ? 

Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . 
 Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ? 
 I want to have a try later . 
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 
 Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . 
 Bingo ! 

Would you like something to drink ? 
 Of course we have lots of teas ? 
 What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ? 
 That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea . 

I'd like to mail this letter to Taipei . 
 Taiwan . 
 Okay . Can I also have a sheet of 20 sixty-four-cent stamps ? 
 By the way , how much does it cost to send a package to Taiwan ? 
 I see . 
 Sorry . We're out of size L's . 
 Why don't you try this other T-shirt ? I think it would look nice on you . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's on your right hand side at the end of this hallway . 

My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . 
 The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . 
 Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . 
 I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . 
 But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous . 
 Yes , but life without chips , ice cream and coca cola is boring . 
 Well , that sounds better than giving it up . 
 Hi . This is Taylor Wright calling . I ’ Ve got an appointment with Doctor Bell at 9.00 tomorrow morning . I ’ Ve got to cancel this appointment . My father-in-law passed away suddenly last night . 
 Thanks a lot . Good bye . 
 Well , I'd like to buy a watch . 
 Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... 
 Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I wonder if it keeps good time . 
 How do I set it ? 
 All right . this suits my taste best . I'II take It . 
 Hi . This is Amy Yang . I ’ m calling for a home phone cancellation . I ’ m moving out next month . 
 The end of this month . 
 No , thanks . 

I ’ m a bit worried about you going shopping by yourself this afternoon . 
 But what will you do if you need to know the price of something ? 
 Ok , but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes ? 
 And what will you do if you don ’ t have enough cash ? 

Does this bus go to Fisherman's Wharf ? 
 Oh , good . Transfer , please . 
 Please let me know when we get there . 
 As a matter of fact , I'm from Taiwan . 
 I will . Thanks . 
 Sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? 
 Dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! 
 How about the Mongolian hot pot ? 
 Maybe we can try ' Yuanyang pot ' this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . 
 Yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . 
 Wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . 
 Yeah . I need to get some stuff . 
 Where's Lisa ? 
 What are coupons ? 
 Really ? 

Well it ’ s my first night in Beijing . What should I eat ? 
 Mm , I don ’ t really like duck to be honest with you . I fancy something light . 
 That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ? 
 Ok then , I ’ ll follow you . 
 I want a Special King size and some chips . 
 Green salad please . 
 Cola , please . 
 ... 
 Thank you .

 We are open until 10 but our last order for dinner is at 9:30 pm .

 l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover . 
 That's not very easy to say . 
 Can you find many bargains there ? 

How nice these frames are !

 I agree , but I like wire frames . 

Can I get you something to drink ? 
 So how about an aperitif ?

 Here we go . 
 Enjoy yourself . 

Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ? 
 What's that ? 
 Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? 
 Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? 
 God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! 

Yes , sir . What'll it be for you ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Is this to go or to eat here ? 
 Here you are . That's eight fifty . 
 It's on the service counter over there . 
 Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . 
 I'd love to try some snacks . 
 Kebabs and roast squid . 
 Help yourself .

 No . I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . 
 OK ... Now how can I help , hon ? 
 Easy . I could do that with my eyes closed . ( after a while ) Done . 
 How many potatoes do you need ? 
 Gotcha ... OK . Here they are . 
 Where's the peeler ? 
 Right over here , sir . What size do you wear ? 
 These here are all mediums . 
 Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? 

Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? 
 We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? 
 How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . 
 Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you .

I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . 
 Not really . It pinches my toes . 
 I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . 

Excuse me , ma'am , can I help you find anything ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 How about this pair ?

 How do I get to the Olympic Stadium , please ? 
 Thanks . 

Excuse me , is there a department store near here ? 
 Where ’ s Wang Fu Jing ? 
 Thank you . 

Hey , Jim , it ’ s time to wake up and get out of bed . 
 You ’ d better get up , or you ’ ll be late . 
 Yes , it did . It went off 30 minutes ago . You slept right through it . You ’ re like a dead person while you sleep . 
 Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead ! 
 The early bird gets the worm . 
 Ha ! Ha ! If you don ’ t make an effort now , later on it ’ ll be a lot tougher for you . 
 Yes . in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ? 
 How did you spend the night there ? 
 I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . 
 Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains . 
 I'd love to . 
 How would you like to pay ? 
 Cash or card is fine . 

What do you think of this flat ? 
 Small , but it should be enough for our needs . I think . 
 That's true . But I love the living room ; it's huge and filled with sunshine . 
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . 
 Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff . 

You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . 
 A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . 

Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . 
 To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too . 
 Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ? 
 I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now . 

Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories . 
 Of course . The changing rooms are over there . 

Can I have a look at that digital camera please ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it . 
 That's all thank you . 
 OK , sir . 
 190 yuan . 
 Thank you . Welcome to call again . Goodbye . 

Bill , please . 
 Excuse me , what's this item for ? 
 But we've can canceled one bottle . 
 I'm sorry for the miscalculation . Here's the new bill . Would you mind checking it again ? 
 If you're staying at our hotel , you may sign the bill . 
 Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea . 
 Yes , Chinese people love drinking tea so much . Some even claim they can't live without tea . 
 Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ? 
 Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ? 
 Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses . 
 Why don't we go for one now ? 
 Let's go ! 
 Okay , let me take a look . 
 Sounds pretty good . I see the equalizer has a good selection of settings . 
 Hmm . This system seems to have everything I'm looking for . It's a bit pricey , though . I'll have to think about it . Thanks for your help . 

Waiter , bill , please . 
 What's this for ? 
 I see . 
 Yes . please . 
 Bill Black , Room 1201 . 
 Sure . Here it is . 
 Yes . I'll be with you in a second . Yes , sir ? What is the problem ? 
 What did you order ? 
 There must be a mistake . Those are fried oysters . Would you like to keep it or change ? 
 Just a moment and I'll get your order right away . Sorry to cause the inconvenience . 
 I'd like to look at your stereo systems . Do you have anything on sale ? 
 But it doesn't have a turntable . I have a fair number of vinyl records , so I need something to play them on . 

What would you like on your pizzas ? 
 Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke . 
 All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes . 

Welcome to Flower Power , sir . What can I get for you ?

Pete's Pizza , may I help you ? 
 Will that be for pick-up or delivery ? 
 Can I get your phone number ? 
 And your address ? 

Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ? 
 I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . 
 Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either . 
 Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now . 
 I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else . 
 That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . 

Would you excuse me ? 
 I ’ Ve got a business call that I really need to take . 

Excuse me , I'd like to have these pants I bought here yesterday altered . Here's my receipt . 
 They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them . 
 Thank you very much . 

Is everything to your satisfaction ? 
 Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . 
 How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ? 
 I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come . 
 Yes , just over there . 
 Yes , they are just next to the newspapers actually . 

Are you ready to order , madam ? 
 Yes , We do have some choices for ladies like you . What about some green salad ? 
 Sure . It's a popular dish among young ladies . 
 We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ? 
 OK . Do you want to order something else ? 

Welcome to our Colonial Tramcar Restaurant , ma'am . Where would you like to sit ? 
 All right . Come with me , please . Here is your seat , ma'am . Would you like to order now ? 
 What would you like for a drink ? 
 What kind ? 
 Would Chablis be all right ? 
 What would you have for a la cane ? 

Good evening , ma'am . Table for one ? 
 Will this table be all right ? 
 Certainly . How about this one ? 
 ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order . 

Here's your roast chicken , ma'am . 
 Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? 
 I'm fine for now , thanks . 
 Well , there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section . Some are written for young children , others for teens . Maybe some of them will suit your needs . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries . 
 Yes , a medium Coke . 
 Yes . 
 To go , please . ( The attendant hands the customer his order . ) 

Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ? 
 And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup . 
 Can I get you anything to drink ? : 
 Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad . 

Can I get you any dessert ? 
 Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ?

Excuse me , I'm looking for the Alands Morrissette album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie . 
 That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ? 
 Great . One last question . Where is your jazz section ? 
 Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help . 

I ’ d like to post this letter to Korea . 
 No thank you . I ’ d like to send it just by normal post . 
 I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please . 
 Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . 
 Yes . I have no plans . 
 Yes , that sounds wonderful . 
 But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian 
 The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat . 
 Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly . 
 Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . 
 Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet . 

S :: Welcome to Flash Foto.What can I do for you , ma ’ am ? 
 S :: What size prints would you like ? 
 S :: All right , ma ’ am , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour . 
 Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ? 
 Sounds nice . I'll have that please . 
 Certainly sir . 
 Actually there ’ s one on the same street as this hotel . 
 Not at all . Turn left out of the hotel and it's about a five minute walk . 
 I know . There are too many cars on the roads these days . 
 Yes , there ’ s too much pollution too ! 
 I'd like a trim . 
 No , thanks . 
 Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears . 

What'll it be today , sir ? 
 Shall we check your oil and tires ? 
 ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . 

Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ? 
 Do you have your negatives ? 
 What size do you want the prints ? 
 Okay , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour . 
 Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ? 
 Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ? 
 Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords . 
 In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation . 
 In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play . 
 You should also get a couple of guitar picks . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Not quite yet . 
 It's still very far away . 
 We're getting close . 
 Here we are . 
 It is in front of you . 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 I ’ d like to buy an inexpensive camera . 
 I don ’ t think I ’ ll need a Polaroid.Does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take this one.Does it come with batteries and a case ? 

Hi , I'm here to look at the one-bedroom apartment you have for rent . 
 ( They walk over to the apartment . ) As you can see , it's large and completely furnished . 
 You have to pay the electricity bill yourself , but water is paid . 

Okay , here's the lease . Read it over before you sign it . As you can see , the deposit is $ 300 . 
 Yes , assuming there's been no damage to the apartment . Before you move in , you can make a list of any marks , scratches , and so forth that are already there . 
 Great . You can move in next Monday . Your first month's rent is due then . 
 I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it . 
 I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school . I can extend it if I want to stay , can't I ? 

Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ? 
 Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ? 
 How much more do I have to pay ? 
 That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train . 
 Thank you ! 
 That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . 
 At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ? 
 Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year . 

Do you want a taxi ? 
 Where to ? 
 Yes , I know it . 
 Yes , of course . Step in , please ! 
 Buckle up the belt , please . 

How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 The Grand Hotel . 
 Yes . Do you know where it is ? 
 It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . 

Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . 
 don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . 
 well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? 
 Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . 
 maybe ... I'll think about it . 

Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 
 That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? 
 I'll get my things and meet you there . 

It's getting late , Mary . 
 Why don't you sleep over ? 
 We can sleep together . 
 Don't forget to call your host mother to tell her . 

Hello , May I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . 

Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . 
 I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . 

What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? 
 Yes . 

How many rooms are you looking for ? 
 150 a month . 
 Rents are very high in downtown area . 
 He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . 
 Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . 
 That's all right . 
 Why ? 
 It is all up to you . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve been getting harassing calls recently . Can I have my phone number changed ? 
 How about 560 436 4040 . 
 How about 560-436-8976 ? 
 As soon as possible . Can I have it right now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . 
 Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . 
 Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . 
 920 pm , I couldn't say . I can't remember . 
 I'm absolutely certain . 
 I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Quite sure . 
 Can you give me the number for Jessica Hanson on locks Ave ? 
 Yes , I ’ m pretty sure . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s 109 Locks Ave , L8V 4N9 . 
 I see . Thanks anyway . 

Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ? 
 Do you have your receipt with you ? 
 When did you buy it from our store ? 
 I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . 
 Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It depends . 
 Um . It ’ s delicious . 
 Not all of it . 
 Positive . 
 I'm absolutely sure I'm right . 
 This is right . There is no doubt in my mind . 
 Check and double check . 
 Oh , dear ! 
 It's not what I asked for . 
 It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 

I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 I don ’ t want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
 Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . 
 No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . 
 Meat , I think . 
 I do , but I want meat . 
 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 
 No , I'll have the fish please . 
 No , I want the fish . 
 Thank you , but I prefer the fish . 
 No , I'd like the fish . 

I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . 
 You should have asked for my opinion before you did it . 
 You'd better remember your promise . 
 What would you like to have ? 
 In that case , what about having some noodles ? 
 All right . I'll cook for you . 
 There ’ s a possibility . I ’ ll check it . 
 That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be right back . 
 I don't like it very much.But every-body likes their own food best . 
 Are you sure ? All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . 

There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . 
 I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . 
 That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 

I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 
 Perhaps I should call her later . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Which room are you in ? 
 I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 

I'm worrying that she may be lost . 
 After all , she is a five-year-old kid . 

I've typed the report . 
 And I've filed the letters . 
 And I've checked the orders . 
 And I've ordered the supplies . 

I feel terribly bored . I'm going to take a job . 
 Then I can buy my own car . 
 And pay for my own clothes . 

Operator , can you give me any information on the call I just received ? 
 Can you tell me the calling number , please ? 
 Thank you . 

Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . 
 I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . 
 Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . 

Happy birthday , John . Many happy returns of the day ! 
 Well , making good wishes . 
 Sure . We hope your wish will come true . 
 What ’ s the number you are calling , please ? 
 What ’ s the name of the person you are calling ? 
 Thanks . What ’ s your name and phone number , please ? 
 Thank you . I ’ ll put the call through for you . Hold on the line , please . 
 Yes . I need a tow truck . My car is broken down . 
 I ’ m on the Highway 401 , close to the Lipton Link . 
 Black . 
 AKIM 400 . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Hello . This is the operator . Can I speak to Mr . Smith , please ? 
 I have a collect call for you from Jennifer . Will you accept the charges ? 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . 
 Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . 
 Really ? Do I have to do it ? 

How beautiful the flower is ! 
 You like it . Well , I'll gather it for you . 
 Where is it ? 

Excuse me , sir ? 
 I'm afraid you can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notice here ? 
 It says ' No smoking ' . 

You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign . 
 It says ' No smoking here ' . 
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 Thank you . 
 He is fine . 
 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . 
 Is this the Customer Service Desk ? 
 I bought a sweater from your store a week ago . It says size 12 . But actually , it is a size 10 . Can I exchange it ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you very much . 

Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 

What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? 

You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? 
 Oh , what ’ s she like ? 
 Is she old or young ? 
 Is she strict ? 
 Can she speak Chinese ? 
 David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . 
 Well . Let ’ s go swimming . 
 Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 
 Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly.Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print.There . 
 Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 Of course ! Where are the things ? 
 Right ! I'll do it straight away . 

This is the Pan-American Club . May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course . The guest speaker is Professor David of a University , and he'll be lecturing about The impact of the Oil Crisis on Latin America . 

It's very dark in here . Will you turn on the light ? 
 Then , turn on the lamp , please . 
 It's there by the window . 
 Let's see . From here , you have to take the 278bus . 
 You should get off at the first Shi Da stop . 
 You're new at this , huh ? 
 No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off . 
 Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus . 
 Don't mention it . 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . 
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . 
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... 
 Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . 
 Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
 Hmm.Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
 Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
 It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
 OK . 
 How about the cinema ? 
 What would you suggest to see ? 

Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ? 
 Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared . 
 I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog . 

Excuse me . I lost my way . Could you tell me where the scholar cinema is , please ? 
 Is that near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . No . I ’ m late for dinner at my house . I really have to go . 
 I ’ d appreciate that . 
 Thanks . 
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . 
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worried about . 

Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I write out again first ? 
 Can I print it ? 

I am so busy today . 
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
 Or maybe make the beds . 
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 

Can I give you a lift home , Mrs . Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 

Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 

Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? 
 Why ? 
 Could it be the battery ? 
 Well , I suppose it could be the gas . 
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 

Oh , no . It seems that I've lost my train ticket . 
 It was in my pocket , but now I can't find it . 
 No , it is not here . Damn it ! I'm going to have to buy another ticket . 
 OK . 
 It's still early . 
 Since we're late , let's go to see a film . 

Excuse me , is this the way to the Great Wall ? 
 I must have taken a wrong turn . 
 And then ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 By the way , how long does it take ? 
 I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? 
 Great ! Thank you ! 

How may I help you . sir ? 
 Let me see . I'm sorry . Nothing's been turned in . Do you want to buy another one ? 
 150 yuan for hard seats . 
 Sir ? 

Come on , darling . We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too ! 
 Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? 
 That won't take long . 
 Well , I'm not quite ready . 
 You wouldn't do a thing like that ! 

Watch out ! It's dark over there . 
 Be careful ! The road is muddy.You might slip . 

Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . 
 I hope so . 
 Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . 
 Thank you for your warning . 
 Be careful of yourself . 
 Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat . 
 Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ? 
 Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight . 
 OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ? 
 Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ? 
 Thanks . How much would that come to ? 

I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 

I think mum should not take sides . After all , we are all her children . 
 It ’ s unfair . 

I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hum , what you say make sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 Yes . Can you show me the menu , please ? 
 Then , what's special tonight ? 
 All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a house . 
 Oh , to rent . 
 About 300 a month . 
 How big is it ? 
 Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's it like ? 
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 

Please show me the menu , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please . 

Hi . This is the Customer Service . How can I help you ? 
 Is it under warranty ? 
 Yes , it is still covered by our warranty . Tell me the mode number of your vacuum , please . 
 What ’ s your address , your name and your phone number ? 
 Okay . There are two Customer Service Offices in your area . The nearest one is Chadwick and Hacks Appliances . 
 Sure . 878 Fennel South . 
 You have to call the office first . 
 My pleasure . 
 Sure . How about this one ? 
 Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . 
 The hardcover is more expensive . 

Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . 
 Will you have it later ? 
 That's terrific . Thank you . 
 Yes . I need some ice water delivered . 
 No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend . 
 Thank you . 

Excuse me . Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . 
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . 
 Ok , I will . 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind . But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer . 
 Furnished . 
 No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . 
 My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ? 

Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 
 Oh ? What's that ? 
 What gift ? 
 You refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
 Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 

I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room . 
 What sort of price are you asking ? 
 Would it be convenient to see the room ? 

Hello . Beijing Restaurant . How can I help you ? 
 For pick - up or delivery ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 What size ? 
 When will you come to pick up your order ? 
 That will be fine . We ’ ll have your meals ready when you arrive . Thank you for your order . 
 Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . 
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 
 It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . 
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 

Are you going home now ? 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
 An apartment ? Why ? 
 Where are you living now ? 
 How are you going to find an apartment ? 
 Apartments in the city are expensive . 

Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 

Hi , John . What brings you to town ? 
 What do you think of the traffic today ? 
 Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . 

There ’ re traffic jams everywhere . 
 Yeah . We should have more roads built . 

This is the rush hour . 
 Let ’ s drive off this road . 

How far do we have to go ? 
 The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . 
 Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . 
 Right . 
 Yes , they all stop at this corner . 
 You can take any bus except the Number 9 . 
 They run about every five minutes . 
 About fifteen minutes . It's not far.Are you a stranger in New York ? 
 How do you like New York city ? 
 You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full . 
 Don't mention it . 
 No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . 
 One dollar . 
 Two stops after this one . 
 Sure . 
 No , a No . 50 will take you right there . 
 The next bus will be here in four minutes . 
 No , it's the number fifty-eight . 
 No , it won't . 
 Never . 
 That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . Its stop is round the corner . 
 I'm going to the hospital to see Susan . 
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? 
 Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? 
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 

Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ? 
 Where can I take it ? 

Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
 That doesn't sound too bad . 
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 

What is the proper way to handle a napkin at dinner ? 
 How about at a formal dinner ? 

Could you drive me to the bank ? 
 Go down this road and then turn left . 

Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry . 
 Down to the basement . 
 Yes . We have a dryer , too . 
 They are in the basement already . 
 Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ? 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra charge for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . 
 I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . 
 I took a taxi . It seemed the easiest thing to do . 
 I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China . They soon showed me the way ! 
 What is it ? It's eight in the morning . 
 No . I'm not a religious person . 
 Maybe next weekend . I went to bed too late last night . 
 Alright . 
 I'm still suffering from a little jetlag . 
 Saturday morning cartoons . 
 I think watching them is a great way to learn English . 
 Yeah . Is Cindy up ? 

Are there other chores for us to do ? 
 You used to do this by yourself ? 
 I'll do the second floor and you do the first floor . 
 What about you ? 

Hello . 
 No , Lily is not here at the moment . 
 Sure . What ’ s your number , please . 
 Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ? 
 You ’ re welcome . Bye . 

Hello . 
 Hi , Troy . How ’ s your trip going ? 
 Are you all right ? 
 Yes . Everything is fine in the family . Don ’ t worry about the family . Just enjoy your trip . How ’ s the weather there ? 
 That ’ s good . Take good care of yourself . 
 I love you , Troy . 

Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? 
 Let's go out for brunch . 
 It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . 

Hey , The Cosby Show is on ! 
 That's right . 
 I'm watching reruns of it . 
 That means our local TV station is showing old episodes . You can watch reruns of nearly every old sitcom . 
 One second , please . ( a few seconds later , the receiver comes back and says ) Hello ? 
 I ’ m sorry . David is out to lunch right now . 
 Sure . Does he know where to call you ? 
 Ok , I will . 
 No problem . 
 Hi , Wendy . I ’ m Gerry . 
 Is Marisa in ? 
 All right . I ’ ll call her later . 
 Bye . 
 Let me see ... One or two bedrooms ? 
 Fine , sir . We can accommodate you . 
 No , sir . We don't allow dogs or cats . 
 Fine . See you on the 18th . 
 Yes ? 
 Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... 
 Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
 Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it . 
 Yes . Why ? 

Excuse me , where is the nearest gas station ? 
 To the traffic lights ? 
 Left at the lights ? 
 Right at the bridge ? 

Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 What is it ? 
 Okay . 
 How late can we stay out ? 
 But if we're going to be late ? 

Lisa , are there family rules in this house ? 
 Like what ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Her room is very neat and clean . 
 I will keep my room clean , too . That's a promise . 
 The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street . 
 It's about a ten-minute walk . 
 Not at all . 
 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 Yes . My home freezer is not working properly . 
 It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted . 
 Can you send the technician to check it out ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll pay the charges . 
 My number is 627-555-1234 . 
 Thank you . Good bye . 

Mary , set your alarm clock for seven tomorrow morning . 
 I'm going to take you to your school to register for classes . 
 You can choose classes that you like at the school office . 
 Well , there are core courses and electives . 
 Core courses are ones that you must take . Elective courses are ones that you get to choose for yourself . 
 All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast . 
 Then , you are to walk to work . 
 Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time . 
 Use the stairs , never the elevator . 
 And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball . 
 OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class . 
 You will . 

Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . 
 I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
 Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? 
 That is truly amazing ! 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 ( After they enter the park ) Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! 
 Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . 

Let's do something outdoors today . 
 Okay . what do you want to do ? 
 All right . That sounds like fun . 
 I am not surprised , you eat too much . 
 No , I wouldn't think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on a diet ? 
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 

I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Sunny-side up , please . 
 What kind of bread do we have ? 
 I think I'll have two slices of whole wheat . 
 Sure . 

Peter , how often do you exercise ? 
 Now , tell me , what do you eat ? 
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 What do you drink ? 
 What do you drink ? 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 Hello . Is Mr . Stewart there ? 
 I ’ m calling from Bell Canada . We are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . With this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges . 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on a diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slim down . 
 I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet . 
 Where are you heading now ? 
 Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? 
 You mean we'll share the taxi ? 
 Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . 
 Take me to the airport , please . 
 I have to be there before 17 00 . 
 There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
 ( After arriving on time ) Here's twenty dollars . 
 No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? 

Excuse me , when is the next train to Los Angeles ? 
 Can I get the ticket here ? 
 Thank you . 
 No , madam . May I help you ? 
 No problem.Step in , please . 

Good , morning ! Can I help you ?

 Sorry , not before 10:30 . 
 One way or round trip ?

 OK.Here is your change.The train leaves on platform 8 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 I think it leaves at two-thirty . 
 Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? 
 Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? 
 Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 

How was your morning jog ? 
 To be honest , I ’ d rather watch television ! Where did you go ? 
 Oh you ought to go to the park next time . They have a route for joggers there . 
 Oh ok then , I ’ ll come and watch you ! 
 Hello . My name is Jessica Smith . I ’ d like to cancel the newspaper . 
 8902365 . 
 845 lincoln Avenue . 
 Beginning the first day of next month . 

Sorry to have smoked in your room . 
 It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I know . I ’ ll try to give it up . 
 I usually have cereal for breakfast . 
 Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up . 
 Is that right ? 
 With cold milk ? 

A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” 
 I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? 
 Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . 
 Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” 
 OK , do you want it urgently ? 
 Right , here you are . 

Kids are always difficult to control . 
 Kids are kids . 
 Yes , but it's quite a ways . 
 This bus doesn't take you directly there.You ' d have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . 
 Go straight ahead through the intersection . 
 Keep walking till ou pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third . 
 Keep walking and look for a tall building . 
 The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 They think you are just a child . 
 Maybe you are right . Well , you can talk with them . 
 There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . 
 Ok . You drive and do be careful . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't sir . 
 But , sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK . I'll blow . 
 But I ... 

Excuse me.When ' s the next bus ? 
 Oh , good.That ' ll be the number forty four ? 
 So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ? 
 So when will it be here then ? 
 Never ? 

Did you promise me to get the bread ? 
 But you forgot to get the bread . 
 Well , I certainly did . 
 You are free . You can go now . 
 I'll do with the cake . 

John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? 

Hello , May I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . 

Why aren't you doing your homework ? 
 Oh , is it ? You'll be making records next , will you ? 
 You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
 I certainly could.You ' ll get exams next month . 
 Oh , don't you ? God save me ! 

Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? 
 Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop ? 
 How many stops are there ? 
 Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
 By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ? 
 Thank you . 
 Um ? 
 As you like . 
 It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . 
 Leave me alone . 
 This is Mary speaking . 
 Oh , that sounds nice . I ’ d love to . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories ? 
 Oh , yes ! 
 I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
 She's eighty-seven . 
 Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ? 
 I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . 
 I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . 
 Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . 
 Yes , I'd like to look at some suits . 
 Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel . 
 It feels all right.But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better.This seems too light for winter.Do you think you could get me one ? 
 It looks good.But can I try it on ? 
 Thanks.It ' s comfortable.Well , how much is it , please ? 
 Ok . I'll take it.Here ' s the money . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . 

What can I do for you , madam ? 
 How about this one ? 
 They're three hundred dollars . 
 OK , This one is one hundred and twenty.It ' s the cheapest here . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a cap.Size 16 . 
 Yes.It ' s a bit tight.Have you got a bigger one ? 
 Yes , that's fine . I'll take it.Can I pay by check ? 

May I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . 
 Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive . 
 They are $ 168 . 

Can I help you , madam ? 
 Have you any particular color in mind ? 
 Red is very popular . 
 Yes , madam , I agree.What size are you ? 
 Here you are , madam.All these are sixteens . 
 It's $ 180 . 
 These are our cheapest coats , madam . 
 Here's your change . 

Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . 

I ’ Ve lost my purse . 
 All my money . 

May I help you ? 
 What dose she look like ? 
 What was she wearing ? 
 When did you last see her ? 
 How long has it been ? 

Excuse me . I lost my way . Could you tell me where the scholar cinema is , please ? 
 Is that near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . 
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . 
 I ’ d better go tomorrow . 

Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ? 
 Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared . 
 I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog . 

Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ? 
 Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
 No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
 Who knows ! That might come to later . 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 

Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I right out again first ? 
 Can I print it ? 

Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way . 
 Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ? 
 Is it far ? 
 And do you know where the national bank is ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 I see . Well , now you can have it as long as you bring it back by nine thirty . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Nick . That ’ s the best I can do . 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 

Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 
 What would you like for dessert ? 

Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal . 
 The chicken is also nice . 
 Our special tonight is lobster . 
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb 
 What ever you say ? 
 Yes , mum . I'm coming . 
 Oh , must I ? 

Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast.Are you tired ? 
 No , you mustn't sit on the grass.Don ' t you see the notes ? 
 It says Keep off the grass ! 
 Be careful.You can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes there ? It says No smoking here . 
 Yes ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . 
 Sorry , I'm very near sighted . 
 Of course , ma'am , Tell me where to go . 
 All right.There we go . 
 The Grand Hotel . 
 Yes.Do you know where it is ? 
 It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . 

Where is that ? 
 Are you in a hurry ? 
 We'll make it except a jam.You know it's rush hour . 
 I'll do my best . 
 Do you have small bills ? 
 Here is your receipt.Thank you . 
 No , madam.May I help you ? 
 No problem.Step in , please . 

Shall we share a taxi ? 
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house . 
 That's the one . 
 Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . 

How far do we have to go ? 
 The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . 
 Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . 
 Right . 
 I think something must be done . 
 I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . 
 Oh , she did ? Then it's a used car of course . 
 What else did she tell you ? Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ? 
 That's not bad.What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ? 
 Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true.Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? 
 Well , we can see it for ourselves.Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ? 

Honey , could you help me here a minute ? 
 I want to put this curtain up . 
 Thanks , dear . 
 Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday.Could you give me some more information about that ? 
 Mmm , that sounds very interesting . 
 What a good idea ! 
 We could go to more places this time , if you liked . 
 When shall we go and look ? 
 No , let's go on Saturday . 
 Where shall we go ? 
 No , I don't like that place.Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended ? 

Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? 
 Why ? 
 Could it be the battery ? 
 Well , I suppose it could be the gas . 
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 

Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu.Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you.Ah ! But this is in French.Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ? 
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet.Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? 

They must have got in through the kitchen window . 
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! 
 look ! they've taken your fur coat too . 
 I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . 
 All right . I'm nearly ready.What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right.Let ' s go . 

What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? 
 Will you say it again ? 

Excuse me , can I use your computer to type my paper ? 
 I am afraid I can't finish typing it this afternoon.When will you use it tonight ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 Your car is rather old.Why not change a new one ? 
 Oh , there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon . I have two tickets.Would you like to go there with me ? 
 And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years ! 
 Really , what's wrong with it ? 
 Oh , do you use your computer often ? 
 Don't worry . Have you got receipt with you ? 
 We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday.Ok ? 
 See you then . 
 Yes ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 Good heavens , am I really ? I'm so sorry , I didn't notice . 
 I see . 

Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? 
 Do I have to turn on the computer ? 
 What should I learn first ? 
 I am ready I am going to get , let's start ! 
 Yes , it's still available . 
 Well , it has got low mileage.The tires are in perfect condition and it's in excellent shape . 
 What's the hardware ? 
 That's seems obvious enough.then what about the software ? 
 I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software . 
 Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . 
 Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . 
 Oh , I don't know.Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . 
 A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . 
 Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . 
 What time is your appointment ? 
 What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? 
 You won't be late.It ' s still early . 
 Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . 
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
 Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind.But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time.Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one.This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 Oh , yes , if you like.The large one goes to Washington.The other one I will take with me . All right ? 
 Oh , thank you . Thank you very much . 
 Yes . I'm looking for an apartment . I'd like two bedrooms . 
 My name's Donald Eakins . 
 It's E-A-K-I-N-S . 
 It's 1446 Pine Street . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , I'm not . 
 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Out in the suburbs.It ' s a long trip to work every day . 
 I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . 
 I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a house . 
 Oh , to rent . 
 About 300 a month . 
 How big is it ? 
 Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's it like ? 
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Come this way please.We ' Ve got plenty of them and they're all on the shelf near the cashier's desk . 
 You're welcome . 
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
 I think so.Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 

Excuse me , do you have A tale of Two Cities ? I'd like a copy of it . 
 Charles Dickens . 
 Ok , Thanks . 
 I'm not sure if we've got any now.Books of that kind are on this shelf.Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . 
 Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by them . 

Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now.Thank you . 

Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street.Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 

Where are you going , Jane ? 
 I saw her yesterday.She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . 
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 Oh , no.You should take the No . 14 tram . 
 Two blocks down the street . 
 Yes ? 
 Certainly.Go along Queen's Road ... 
 Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
 Yes.Then cross the road at the next traffic lights.The Peak Tram is straight ahead.You can't miss it . 
 Yes.Why ? 

Excuse me , sir.Is there a barber near here ? 
 I'm a stranger here.How can I get there , please ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . 

Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 

Excuse me , please.Could you tell me how to get to the No . 10 Middle School ? 
 Is it far from here to there ? 
 Many thanks ! 

How many rooms are you looking for ? 
 150 a month . 

John , it ’ s time to get up . 
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
 It ’ s nearly half past seven . 
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
 Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . 
 No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . 

Peter , why don't you go outside and play basketball with your friends ? 
 I just can't understand why you want to stay at home . It is such a wonderful day today . 
 Didn't you just finish watching a basketball game on TV ? 
 Oh , Peter . You really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games . 
 You really shouldn't watch so much television . 
 You could get there this way , but it'd be faster to go along the Wort Street . 
 Turn right at the third intersection , you'll see the street and then walk along the street to the south . 
 Just walk for a few minutes , you'll find it . 

Excuse me , sir , could you please tell me the way to Aidan Bookstore ? 
 Er ... Is it far from here ? 
 Then I'll walk.Many thanks . 

Is this watch yours ? 
 Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . 

Which school is your children in ? 
 Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . 
 But the private school don't amount to better schools . 
 Huh ? 
 Okay , mom . 
 It will be hard at first , but I think I can do it . 
 I will do my best . 

Do you take in students ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Do you think I could have a look at it , please . 

Hello . Can I speak to Anne ? 
 It ’ s Mike , her boyfriend . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Let's blow on it . 
 Yummy ! Yummy ! Eat more ! 
 Hi , my sweetheart . It ’ s Dad . 
 I ’ m at work right now . You can reach me at 905 675 9870 . Please call this number if you need me . 
 I love you . 

Hi , boss . You have a call . 
 I know . But she said she had an important thing to tell you . 
 Thanks . 
 I'll try my best . 
 Please tell me where your daughter's home is . 
 Turn right at the second traffic light and you will see it on your left . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 What is your favorite color , miss ? 
 Here you are.It ' s very attractive . 
 Go ahead . 
 Right over there . 
 Yes , you look very nice . 
 We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax . 

Where on earth are we ? 
 What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? 
 Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . 

How much shall I pay ? 
 Here is 40 dollars.Keep the change , please . 

Can I help you ? 
 That's $ 38 , sir . 
 Sorry sir.We can't . Cash only . 
 Thank you.Have a nice day . 
 I'd like to buy a pair of leather shoes . 
 Size 38 or 39 . 
 But they are a little tight , They Pinch . 
 I know.But can you show me a little larger size ? 
 This pair fits me perfectly . I feel comfortable . 
 Here are all the wallets with various designs . How about this one ? It is quite fashionable . 
 Of course . 
 This one is much better , but it is also much more expensive . 
 Two hundred and thirty-five yuan . 

What are you doing to your house ? 
 What are you going to do to it ? 
 What colour are you going to paint them ? 
 What else are you going to do ? 

Is there anything I could help you with , sir ? 
 This way , please . 
 These are French coats , sir.They are quite fashionable these days . 
 How does that fit , sir ? 
 It looks good on you . 
 I'd get it myself if I could . 

Give me enough for a skirt , will you ? 
 Can you give me a discount ? 
 OK . 72 yuan . 
 No , Thanks.Not today . 

Something wrong ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Do you want me to take a look ? 
 Well , if you change your mind , let me know . 
 No problem . 
 Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . 
 Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . 

I ’ Ve been told you might have a vacant room . 
 How much are you asking ? 
 Could I see the room , please ? 

Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . 
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
 I don't want to do that to you , Karen . 
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
 Yes . I ’ ll have a room free next week . 
 25.00 dollars a week , but you can't have visitors . 
 Could you come back later ? We ’ re right in the middle of dinner . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve get a small room . 
 35.00 dollars a week , but I don ’ t allow smoking . 
 Would you mind waiting ? I ’ m on the telephone . 
 I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
 I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
 Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 
 Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available . 
 30.00 dollars a week . 
 I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? 
 There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately . 
 Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely . 
 Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel . 
 Come with me . 
 Don't take your personal belongings . We need to get out of the building now ! 
 Crouch down and try not to breathe in the smoke . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

What ? Your diamond ring is lost ? 
 It must have been stolen by the few thieves . I ’ ll get it back for you . 

Don ’ t be angry with them . After all , they are still children . 
 If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track . 

You should not have criticize your son in front of his friends . 
 I know . But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds . 
 But it is not the right time . 
 I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad . 

The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching . 
 How are you getting along with your studies ? 
 But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice . 
 What is your problem ? 
 You need not always do that . Why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ? 
 He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school . 
 Yeah . He told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor . 
 OK ! What about taking them outside and flying a kite . 

Dad , can you buy a new camera ? My old one has gone west . 
 So , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . This time how about a better one ? 

What are you doing ? 
 Let regive you a hand . 

But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play . 
 Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them . 
 You should send him to the boarding school . He need a strict teacher . 

Jack , let ’ s go ! 
 Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! 

What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
 Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to but one today . 
 Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit . 
 Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision . 
 The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . 
 Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . 
 I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? 
 Well , wait a minute . 
 It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . 
 I hope so . 
 Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ? 
 Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ? 

Can you help me now ? 
 That'll be too late . 
 I did , but he wasn't able to either . 
 Use them from the outside in . 
 Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ? 
 Let's look at our menus . 
 Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees . 
 Because I went out . 
 I didn ’ t have any change . 
 I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why . 
 I'm OK . 
 Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 
 First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . 
 OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . 

What're you doing now ? 
 You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . 
 And don't ever forget it . 
 But this is how I like them , Mum . They ’ re just beginning to look right . 

Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ? 
 Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
 No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
 Who knows ! That might come to later . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 

Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . 
 Why ? 
 You got lost . You're kidding ! 
 You could have called . 
 You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 
 I don't know . Where ? 
 Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? 
 Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
 Hmm , maybe I do . 
 Maybe I have an idea how it happened . 
 You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . 

Excuse me . 
 I just checked in , and there's a problem with my room . 
 I asked for a non-smoking room , and I don't have one.My room smells like cigarette smoke . I can't stand it.Could you change my room , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 That's OK . Thanks for your help . 
 Can you believe this ? I locked my keys in the car , and I have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt . 
 I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ? 
 Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there . 
 Oh , and Andy ? Do you have a quarter for the phone ? My wallet's in the car . 
 No , that's it . Thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 Is it kept in hand now ? 

How silly of you to jump out of the window ! 
 Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . 
 Maybe the situation is too urgent . 

What are you looking for ? 
 Where did you lose it ? Maybe I can help you to find it . 

The taxi drivers are on strike again . 
 They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline . 

Could you help me with these books ? 
 Please , George . 

Tell me what ’ s the matter with you , Bill . 
 Come on . Let ’ s talk heart to heart . I think we can find a solution . 
 What words ? Can you tell me ? 
 Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . 
 I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . 
 Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . 

Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? 
 I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . 
 My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now . 
 Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something . 
 Yeah . Complete with nice of you . 
 Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen . 
 I call the landlord right now . 
 Yes , does the renting include utilities ? 
 How much is the cable ? 
 Also , are they allowing the apartment ? 
 I see . Do you love pets ? 

Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? 
 It's not your birthday , also not mine . Hey , come on . Just tell me . 
 My dear , tomorrow is our wedding anniversary . We've been together for 20 years . But you never change . Always so careless ! Do you remember the thing that happened on our wedding day ? 
 Yeah . Do you know that this restaurant used to be the teahouse where we first met ? 
 Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift . 
 Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . 

Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . 
 OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? 
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! 
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 
 Wow . That sounds really good . 
 Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? 

Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . 
 But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ? 
 What would happen if they started attacking you ? 
 I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ? 
 Come on , daddy . You can see that people only pick the red ones . 
 Oh , then what would happen if there were pests ? 
 Cool ! Well , let's go over there to join mom . I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method . 
 A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . 
 Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . 

What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ? 
 I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar . 
 Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! 
 Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . 
 Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move . 
 Cool . Thanks . 
 There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? 
 Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . 
 I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . 
 OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . 
 That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today . 
 I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one . 
 Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? 

Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . 
 I think you are flicking through it . 

I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? 
 But each children has his own interest . 

May I be of any assistance ? 
 You can have a broad choice here . Are you interested in a particular brand ? 
 Ma'am , these are complimentary with each purchase . How about that one below the toys ? This is the best seller . They are of the latest model that can be found in town . 
 Yes , we do . What a great taste you have ! But we only have one left in stock . 
 You know a good product will always sell ! Would you mind waiting for a while , we'll get it right away . 
 Here it is . It's very elegant , I think you will like it . 
 Its durability will be a big surprise to you . 
 500 yuan . And if you buy it today , there will be a 15 % discount for you . 
 Good morning . I need a new identification card . 
 My ID card is lost . 
 I only have my household register . 
 Here you are , sir . What do I do next ? 
 Benjamin . 
 I've brought with me some of old ones . 
 OK , what's next then ? 

Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? 
 Do I have to turn on the computer ? 
 What should I learn first ? 
 I am ready I am going to get , let's start ! 
 We're redecorating our living room . 
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 
 Pale yellow . 
 We're going to put in some new furniture . 
 Daddy , what seasonings are you going to cook the meat with ? 
 What ? Are you kidding ? 
 I remember Mom going with a lot of pepper for the meat . 
 You peel the onions and wash them , then chop them . 
 Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there . 
 What is your father doing now ? 
 How about Daniel ? 
 Be careful of the peeler . Don't cut your fingers . 
 OK , we've finished . Can you get your father and brother ? 

How far do we have to go ? 
 The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . 
 Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . 
 Right . 
 It can ’ t be time to get up yet . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 My watch says ten past . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 
 It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . 
 I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . 
 Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . 
 Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . 
 A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . 
 it's hard to say , but i do love foxtrot and waltz . 
 to tell the truth . i don't like it , it's too noisy . 
 oh , it's really beautiful . but i just can't dance it well . 
 ok . 

Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 

Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? 
 May I buy a ticket here at the station ? 
 Where ? 
 Thanks . 
 Your car is rather old . Why not change a new one ? 
 Oh , there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon . I have two tickets . Would you like to go there with me ? 
 And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years ! 
 Yes . When is the next train to New York City ? 
 Aren't there any trains before 10 thirty ?

Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car . 
 She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles . 
 Three thousand dollars . 
 He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . 
 No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . 
 Hi , Tom . Want a cup of coffee ?

 Good thing , we took a taxi .

 Your sister is in high school now ; no one plays the piano at home . 
 Why ? Why not ! The piano is right there . 
 Anyway , I will have a look at the piano class after work by myself .

 I want it the way Peckham wears it . 
 Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here . 
 Sure , he is a soccer star . 
 Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . 
 It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . 
 He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . 
 Do it , please . 
 Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ? 
 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . 

Would you please take a seat over there ? There are some interesting magazines on the coffee-table . 
 It shouldn't be long . Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ? 
 Good idea . Do you want a wash or a massage ? Massage is especially good when you are tired . 
 Because it helps you speed up your circulation . 
 How do you like it ? 
 We have discount coupons . 100 Yuan for ten times . Would you like to have one ? 
 Of course . 

Can I help you ? 
 To buy or to rent ? 
 How much do you want to pay ? 
 Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . 
 It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . 
 Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one . It's opposite the park . 
 It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
 Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 Of course , Sir . 
 Oh , it's really popular these days . 
 Honestly speaking , I think the one next to it suits you better . 
 That's not true . Look over there ! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you . 
 Which color do you like ? 
 Nice choice . 
 I hope not but it will take at least three hours . 

Hello , May I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . 

Hello , may I help you ? 
 Oh , we only take care of mail . For parcels , you can go to the next window . 
 Where do you need it to be delivered to ? 
 OK , please fill out this form . 
 Wait a moment , let me check it out for you . It's 200085 . 
 Hold on , let me put it on the scale . It weighs up to 10kg and that will be 30 Yuan , please . 

Hello , I'd like to subscribe to a magazine . 
 Fitness Consultant . 
 Only one , please . 
 For six months , please . 
 Shirley , that's my wife's name . I subscribe to this magazine for her . 
 OK . How much is the subscription ? 
 650 Yuan ! You must be kidding ! I can subscribe for evening newspapers for ten years with that much ! 
 I want to buy a cell phone for my daughter . 
 She is 17 . It's for her birthday . 
 Thanks , but I want to have a look at the Motorola's products . 
 Sounds perfect . I'll take the pink one . Can you pack it for me ? 
 Why not ? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well . I'd take this one . 
 Thanks . 
 I need a phone card for this new cell phone . 
 It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student . 
 What's special with the service ? 
 That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card . 
 Oh , good . Then what is it ? 
 May I have two of them ? 
 Okay , then a third one for my husband too . 
 Here it is . 350 Yuan all together . 
 Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt . 
 Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration . 
 You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ? 
 Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come . 
 Yes . 

Thank you , 175 yuan . 
 Here is your change and your receipt.Do you have goods unpaid on you , sir 
 I'm sorry I need to call the security to have a look . 
 Sorry , sir , it's my job to make sure the goods are paid . 
 Sure . Ah ... That's the problem . Have you paid for it 
 Let me see ... Oh , I am awfully sorry sir . 

May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ? 
 You are such a good father . It's next Sunday . 
 What about a cell phone ? She is old enough to have one . 
 Maybe we can try shopping on line . 
 I'm sure that May would love the pink one . 
 Totally . Computers bring with them convenience.Oh , what's wrong ? 
 Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later . 
 What kind of performance ? A lion dance ? 
 Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before . 
 Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people . 
 What about the costumes ? 
 Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . 

Be quick . Put our bags in the deposit box . 
 I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . 
 I surely did ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there . 
 It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . 
 That sounds like a good idea ! 
 What color do you want ? 

Good morning , May . Good girl , you are reading English books again . 
 Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu . 
 Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ? 
 Really ? A foreign parrot ! 
 Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words . 

Mom , I'm starving . 
 My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? 
 You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . 
 Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! 
 What was that again ? 
 I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . 
 I'll get knee to knee with her . 

Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ? 
 Fine . Where are the other guys ? 
 Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? 
 Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . 
 No , that will be too expensive . 
 My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . 
 I'll appreciate it so much . 
 Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold . 
 No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something . 
 Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already . 
 Do we ? Where is it ? 
 Be careful . Now I have no one but you to depend on . 
 What's the new strike ? 
 Poor me ! 
 The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning . 
 Honey , wait for me . I am too tired to move a step further . 
 Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking . 
 Honey , be patient . It's better to wait than to climb with my legs broken . 
 Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ? 
 Of course not , I have to watch my American Idol . 
 What's up ? Honey ! 
 Honey , it doesn't matter . The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other . 
 You go figure it out yourself . 
 OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one . 
 Danny , back to your position . Move ! 

Excuse me . I seem to have lost my son . 
 Shirley . 
 Daniel . 
 He is in a blue sportswear and a white sportsshoes . About 1.4 meters . 

Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here . 
 Come on baby , stop trying to pretend like a man . If you go there , you are sure to like them . 
 I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy . 
 All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom . 
 I thought you had grown out of such child practices . 
 Gross ! 

Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . 
 Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ? 
 I want to have a try later . 
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 
 Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . 
 Bingo ! 

The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy . 
 She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water . 
 My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things . 
 Really ? I really want to have a try ! 
 That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it . 
 May I take your order ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 I have no idea . First time here . 
 Oh , it's rice rolls with fried shrimp inside . 
 There are twenty rolls in a bowl . You can get another bowl for free if there aren't enough rolls . 
 OK , shrimp rolls . Do you want anything else ? 
 OK , wait a moment please . 
 Why not ? It's my parking space . 
 Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space ! 
 Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red . 
 Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 That's all right . It's not your fault . 
 It has fifty parking spaces . 
 Why ? 
 Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . 
 We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . 
 I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . 
 That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . 

Hey , look out ! 
 You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . 
 No , mine ! 
 I've just had it repainted . 
 I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful . 
 What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ? 
 OK . I gotta call mine too . 
 Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . 
 Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation . 
 Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor . 
 Have you taken this to the property management , yet ? 
 Where ? On the road ? 
 Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ? 
 That's my wife ! 
 Er , let me see . Oh , look , you're right here . Pretty close to the Olympic Park . 
 Is this your first time here ? Where are you going ? 
 Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ? 
 Wow , it is quite far away from here . I'm afraid you're gonna have to take Bus No . 713 . 
 What kind of keys ? 
 What a shame ! I didn't see them . 
 Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys . 
 It's not a big deal.Hey , I found them . 
 You're welcome . 
 Fill it up with regular , please . 
 No , thanks . I'm in a hurry . 
 Good ! How much is it ? 
 That is expensive . 

Daddy , are you going to the park with us this weekend ? 
 So you can't go with us , right ? 
 Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends . 
 Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace . 
 Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice . 
 Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ? 
 Very well , Go ahead . 
 Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? 
 No , thanks Mom . I'd like some toast and chicken wings . 
 Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . 
 Yes , madam . 
 No , mom , I can manage it by myself . His help just causes more trouble . 
 Yes . I used to come out here with my grandpa as child . 
 Aren't you happy now ? I hadn't seen the piano when I was a child . 
 The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera . 
 All right . Give me a big smile . Are you ready ? Cheese ! 
 Excuse me , sir . Could you take a photo for us ? Just press this button . 
 I'm not in the mood . 
 I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals . 
 Cute ? Hope so . 
 Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please . 
 I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding . 

That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it . 
 Honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now . 
 Now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters . 
 I want to adopt a cat , and it can be Barbie's boyfriend too . 
 That's all right . At least I got myself left . 
 I hope that he would grant me with that . 

Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? 
 Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . 
 Can you recommend some must-try ? 
 What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! 
 Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . 
 I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ? 

Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us . 
 It doesn't matter . But I really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . 
 It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano . 
 Ahh , I was not available last Sunday . I was too busy almost as much as you . 
 Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . 
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 

The tea smells good . What tea is it ? 
 What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? 
 They must have some special methods to do this during the process . 
 Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? 
 What's the advantage about tea ? 
 Does that mean the stronger the better ? 
 Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? 
 Why ? 

There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like . 
 If you have any problem , please come to me . 
 You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell . 
 Do you have any special request ? 
 So that means you are shopping for presents ? 
 Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle . 
 I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . 
 As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . 

Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ? 
 Really ? How to do that ? 
 That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? 
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . 
 Are there any disadvantages about it ? 

Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? 
 Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . 
 Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? 
 Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? 
 I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? 
 Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . 
 I'll take care of the order . 
 Don't forget about the dessert . 

Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? 
 Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . 
 I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? 
 It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . 
 Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! 
 Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . 
 That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? 
 How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . 

Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Our red wine is very famous . I'd suggest you try that . 
 Here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . You can have a taste then make your decision then . Here is the wine menu . 
 Then do you like any cheese to go with it ? 
 Oh , no . But cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . And we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . Here are the pictures . Pick out something you like . 
 What would you like for appetizer and dinner ? 
 How do you want your steaks , rare , medium or well-done ? 
 Anything for dessert ? 
 OK . Please wait for s while . We'll get it done quickly ! 
 I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash . 
 That's OK . But that must be costly . 
 Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer . 
 I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash . 
 Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing . 
 I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ? 

Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice . 
 I'm afraid that a button is missing . 
 OK , please . 
 Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . 
 It's been several days now , I am not sure . 
 Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ? 
 OK , I will . 
 Thanks a lot . 

We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . 
 Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 
 Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . 
 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
 No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . 

Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service . 
 Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . 
 Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . 
 Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . 
 It surely is . And the cast is really the best . 
 The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . 
 I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too . 
 Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
 Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . 
 They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
 Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? 
 Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . 
 It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can . 
 Here we go . 
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 
 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? 
 How much again ? 
 That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . 
 DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ? 
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? 
 OK , I'll take one . 
 I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . 
 We are nor alone here . So many other families ! 
 Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . 
 Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? 
 Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? 
 Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . 
 I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world . 
 Well , OK . you are always right . 
 I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . 
 One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids . 
 Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? 
 Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings . 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ? 
 My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? 
 What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . 
 Ok , tell me . 
 And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . 
 Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . 
 At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . 
 Hmm , that is bad . 
 Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . 
 You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? 
 I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? 
 I am going there , too . We can walk together . 

Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ? 
 Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . 
 I ’ m sorry . I guess I ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank . 

So how's everything going for Christmas ? 
 What's that ? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . 
 He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ? 
 You think it's better that he should be told ? 
 That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real . 
 Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that . 
 Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me . 
 Oh , you read ? Very good . Then , I think we should do something different today . I'll give you some privilege . 
 Now I see what you read the book for . But it's fine . I'll give you the lion's share . 
 This is not common noodles . They're “ long-lived ” noodles.it ' s an old Chinese tradition to eat.long - lived noodle on birthday . 

Want to send out for some Chinese ? 
 Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . 
 Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . 
 Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . 
 Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . 
 I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot . 
 Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ? 
 Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional . 
 The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ? 
 Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too . 
 Come on . Don's go too far . 
 OK then . We shall ask them to put some red chilli on it . 
 It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . 
 Let's get it back . 
 You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . 
 Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . 
 That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! 
 You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . 
 Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? 
 What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . 
 Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . 
 Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price . 
 Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . 
 Of course . It's a newly-built one . 
 Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . 
 Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? 
 Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . 
 Really ? You must be ... 
 That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . 
 He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . 
 Can you take he away from me ? 
 She kept bothering me . 
 But I am her brother , not her servant . 
 There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . 
 Ok . You drive and do be careful . 
 The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet . 
 No , But does that matter ? 
 I see . I'd better never try . 
 Do you know what's wrong with my PC ? 
 Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ? 
 I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ? 
 Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that . 
 He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? 
 Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job . 
 It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday . 
 That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . 
 Let's do it together . 
 For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ? 

Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman . 
 Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ? 
 How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? 
 Oh , my God ! 
 Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? 
 Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? 
 Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . 

Excuse me ? Can you do me a favor , please ? 
 I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today . 
 I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation . 
 I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel . 
 Yes , it is . Do you know where I can get a town map ? 
 Great , do you have any for foreigners ? I mean English version ? 
 OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? 
 But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . 
 Dad , it makes no sense . 
 Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan . 
 Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? 
 OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move . 
 Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please . 
 No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving . 
 OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department . 
 Honey , what's up ? 
 Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? 
 Did you panic at the time ? 
 Was there anyone else with you ? 
 So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? 
 For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? 
 That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . 

Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ? 
 I said , I'm Ted , who are you ? 
 Do you come here often , Laura ? 
 Let's go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 
 I asked if you come here often . 
 No , this is my first time here . 
 Yeah , that's why I'm here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . 
 I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don't mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I'll do it in a park . 
 I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one . 
 Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them . 
 Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
 What happened ? 

So what do you think of my new dress ? 
 Um , ninety-five dollars ? 
 I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
 I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . 
 I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 
 Isn't that complicated ? 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 
 What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? 
 Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . 
 That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . 
 Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . 
 Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . 
 After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . 
 No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? 
 No , Officer , not at all . 
 Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer . 
 Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . 
 Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . 

Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . 
 A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 When is the place available ? 

I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . 
 Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . 
 Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . 

Can you tell me how to reach the bank please ? 
 I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank . 
 How do I get there . I have no knowledge of this area . 
 It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ? 
 Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ? 

What does a housing go for in south mountain district ? 
 We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home . 
 Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose . 
 What about a two-bedroom house ? 
 I see . 
 Okay , I will take it into consideration . 
 I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . 
 Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . 
 That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . 
 Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . 
 Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . 
 I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . 
 Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . 

This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum . 
 That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 I need to talk it over with my wife . 

I heard you are looking for a house . 
 How is this going ? 
 I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer . 
 It is on Spring Avenue . 
 It ’ s $ 240 a month . 
 It includes water , but not gas and electricity . 
 But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first . 

Are you looking for an apartment ? 
 I think I have just a right apartment for you . 
 Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens . 
 Yes , it ’ s brand-new . 
 It ’ s $ 8.50 a month . 
 We can take a see by there now if you like . The landlord left me a set of keys with me . 

Hello , Matt ! 
 Matt , I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question , do you have a pet ? 
 Wow , like how do they train the dogs ? 
 Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? 
 Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? 
 Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? 
 Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? 

Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . 
 Out ? What do you mean out ? 
 Dad and mom ? 
 You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? 

I'm sorry I'm so late . I had a really bad day . 
 I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag . 
 I didn't think of it.Thank you.And I do apologize for being late . 
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . 
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
 But I just want to give her some tips . 
 I guess you are right . 
 I hope so . 
 Terrible . 
 Someone robbed my apartment last week . The robber took $ 550 . 
 No . 
 My English isn't very good . I didn't know what to say to them . 

You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? 
 Oh , what ’ s she like ? 
 Is she old or young ? 
 Is she strict ? 
 Can she speak Chinese ? 
 David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 

Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 But they ’ re very nice , you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . 
 Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ? 
 All right . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 You've got it , sir . 
 Well , sir . Can I take your measurements first ? 
 That'll be helpful . All right , thank you . 
 No , problem . If you'll wait one moment , I'll make out your receipt . 
 Let me see , with padding and lining cloth , it comes to 357 dollars altogether . 
 In two weeks . 

Would you please make a skirt for me with this material please ? 
 I like miniskirt . 
 When can I get it ? 
 Thank you , see you then . 

Are you going home now ? 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
 An apartment ? Why ? 
 Where are you living now ? 
 How are you going to find an apartment ? 
 Apartments in the city are expensive . 

Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . 
 But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
 Well , only you liked it really , darling . 

Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 

Hi . You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . What would you like me to do ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV ! 
 Which spices are you going to add to the meat ? 
 Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ? 
 Right . What are you doing over there ? 

Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 

Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ? 
 Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ? 
 I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese . 
 I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ? 
 I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ? 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . 
 So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? 
 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
 You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . 
 I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . 
 Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large-that ’ s the fashion . 
 There . It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later . 

Good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . 
 When did it first break down ? 
 Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . 
 Ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . 
 Part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily . 

Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? 
 You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? 
 It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? 
 In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . 
 It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... 
 Yes , but it's quite a ways . 
 This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . 
 Go straight ahead through the intersection . 
 Keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third . 
 Keep walking and look for a tall building . 
 The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
 Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! 
 Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . 
 This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! 
 License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? 
 Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ? 
 Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ? 
 You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney , if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you . 

Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . ' 
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! 
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 
 Great play ! 
 Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! 
 I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second . 
 Alright , alright . I ’ m coming . 
 You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries . 
 Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! 
 Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast 

Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! 
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . 
 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 

Hurry up , get in . 
 OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! 
 Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! 
 Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! 
 Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! 
 Yes ! We made it . 5 fifty-eight , just before the library closes . 

You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you . Do you understand ? 
 What's your name ? 
 What's your nationality ? 
 What's your relationship with the victim ? 
 Why did you attack the victim ? 
 How many times did you stab the victim ? 
 Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ? 
 Was it your intention to kill the victim ? 
 OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him . 
 What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn't do anything . 
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . 
 I don't need your help , jerk . 

Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 
 Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . 
 Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . 
 I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . 

I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card . 
 We only need to verify your information against our records . 
 Please show me your passport and Residence Permit . 
 How long have you been living here ? 
 May I know your occupation ? 
 Is that right ? Which university , if you don't mind my asking ? 
 Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time . 
 I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . 
 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 
 Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 
 That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . 
 The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot . 
 I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . 
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 
 I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please . 
 Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ? 
 No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here . 
 Is this salami and bologna you have here ? 
 Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . 
 Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today . 

Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there . 
 Fine ! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . Do you prefer paper or plastic ? 
 No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . 
 Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? 
 Will this be debit or credit ? 
 Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 
 Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . 
 You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! 
 You ’ re so picky sometimes . 
 Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
 Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . 
 Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . 
 Um ... no . 

This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . 
 Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . 
 Sure that ’ s fine . 
 Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? 
 Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . 
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! 
 All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! 
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . 
 Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control !

 Sure , that sounds good . 
 No , make the second one with ham , pineappleand green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . 
 Perfect . Thank you . Bye ... 

Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I ... 
 I haven't even told you what it is yet ! 
 Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to a concert tonight . 
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! 
 Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please ! 
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 
 That ’ s so unfair ! 
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . 
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . 
 I don't remember . 
 40 miles per hour . 
 Just straight . 
 No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . 

Excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ? 
 How far up the street are the traffic lights ? 
 Ok . So I turn right at the traffic lights . Then ? 
 Ok . Where do I go then ? 
 God it . Thans very much . 
 We need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . 
 Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . 
 I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? 
 Ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . 
 Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? 
 let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything . 

Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? 
 Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? 
 Are the reports favorable ? 
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 
 I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . 

Do you buy that newspaper every day ? 
 Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? 
 What section does it have ? 
 What ’ s in that section ? 
 I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't sir . 
 But , sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK . I'll blow . 
 But I ... 

Do you often buy magazines ? 
 Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
 Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
 Do you have a subscription ? 
 I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . 
 There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price . 
 Which tests do you mean ? 
 Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . 

Your dog is so much fun . He ’ s so playful . I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does . 
 She ’ s eight years old . She ’ s getting quite old . Your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ? 
 I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home . 
 She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse . 
 The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat ! 
 Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . 
 He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 
 Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks . 
 I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 

What would you like for dessert ? 
 I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . 
 Of course . I made apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . 
 Sure . Can you get it yourself ? It ’ s in the refrigerator . 
 Yes . I ’ ll have an ice tea . You ’ ll see it next to the lemonade . 
 I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight . 
 I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . 
 It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . 
 I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . 
 Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . 

I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? 
 I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . 
 That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? 
 I like the red one . What do they eat ? 
 Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . 

I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . 
 I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . 
 I smoke around 30 each day . 
 If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . 
 I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . 

Hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . What exercises are you going to do today ? 
 Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly . 
 Sure . Is today only you second visit ? 
 The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later . 
 That's right . You don't want to injure yourself by exercising too much or in the wrong way . Now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ... 
 Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties . 
 I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up ! 
 They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes . 
 I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop . 
 It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . 
 I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians ! 
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ? 
 You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 
 Italian , Indian , and Chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice . 
 Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . 
 Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours . 
 We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef . You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? 
 yes . I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops . 
 Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty . Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine . 
 You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . 
 No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . 
 You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . 
 I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ? 

It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! 
 It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . 

Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland . 
 He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . 
 Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! 

Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
 No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . 
 So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . 
 Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting . 
 Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine . 
 I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . 
 Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . 
 As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . 
 You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . 
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . 
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 
 I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better . 

I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? 
 I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . 
 Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? 
 Yes . I have some many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . 
 That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . 
 Ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . 
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room . 
 You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom . 
 Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store . 
 You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . 

Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ? 
 I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . 
 We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . 
 Why is it relatively expensive ? 
 I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . 
 Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . 

Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . 
 First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . 
 We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . 
 Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . 
 Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . 

Have you seen Bill recently ? 
 Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood . 
 He ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold . 
 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . 
 Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling . 
 Yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . 
 It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
 You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
 Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . 
 That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 

I ’ d like to send this parcel to Australia . 
 Sure . It ’ s not very heavy . 
 I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail . 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel . 
 Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars . 

How can I help you ? 
 What ’ s your destination ? 
 Ok . When is your train supposed to leave ? 
 OH , dear . What ’ s your last name , please ? 
 And your passport number ? 
 Let me see ... it doesn ’ t look like we have any information about your ticket here . 
 Oh dear . I ’ m really sorry , sir . But you don ’ t have any proof of purchase . You ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket . 
 It depends on how you want to travel . If you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 RIB , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100RMB . 
 looks like you might like the soft sleeper then . 
 ... sir ? 
 Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket . 
 You ’ re just 4 mao short for the hard sleeper , but I ’ ll let it go . Anything for love ! 

Good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? 
 Certainly . For how many people ? 
 I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? 
 Yes . That ’ s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . Could you give me your name please ? 
 Yes . Do you intend to order a Lacarne or will you be having our seafood buffet ? 

Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . 
 No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . 
 How far is that ? 
 According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London . 
 Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! 
 Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ? 
 22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? 
 We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . 
 I'm afraid I can't . 
 Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . 
 No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems . 
 No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 Sure . It ’ s quite far from here . Don ’ t worry , though . It ’ s not difficult to get there . 
 Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ? 
 That ’ s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ’ s a really big hotel . You can ’ t miss it . Turn left at the hotel . 
 Then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you . 
 No problem . 
 Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . 
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . 

Why don't we get ourselves a new car ? The old one's falling apart . 
 What kind shall we get ? 
 Yes , fine . 
 Why not sometime next week ? 
 OK . 
 There's a car dealer down the road . How about going there ? 
 Fine , We'll do that . 
 Hi , Rich . Is Jim here ? 
 Sure . This is Claire . 
 No , it ’ s 3725019281 . 
 No , it ’ s 3725019281 , it ’ s a 9 , not a 5 . 
 Can you tell him that it ’ s urgent ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Bye . 

They must have got in through the kitchen window . 
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! 
 Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . 
 I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . 
 I wish we could , but we can't , you see , we are not insured . 
 All right . I'm nearly ready . What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right . Let's go . 

Come on ! It's time to go ! 
 Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . 
 Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . 
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! 
 Oh , yes , I would ! 
 I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . 
 We hope so . 
 Oh dad . You don't understand at all . 
 I don't need it to play the guitar . 
 I'm sorry . 
 Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ? 
 That one there ? 
 Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful . 
 Do you ? Dad is in the study . 
 Behave yourself ! Don't make any noise . Have you finished your homework ? 
 Then let me see . 
 All right . Just five minutes . Be sure not to touch anything . 
 Be careful ! 

I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide . 
 I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . 
 I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . 
 Yes , it really needs redecorating . 
 I don ’ t suppose you could . 
 I ’ ll be glad if you would . 
 Can I help you ? 
 uh ... Yes . Turn right , then take the second turning on your left . 
 It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all . 
 Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right . 
 You are welcome . Good luck . 

Is there anything wrong ? 
 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . 
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
 Oh , she can make her own decisions . 
 Believe me . Everything will be ok . 

Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 

You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? 
 Oh , what ’ s she like ? 
 Is she old or young ? 
 Is she strict ? 
 Can she speak Chinese ? 
 David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . 

Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ? 
 Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
 No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
 Who knows ! That might come to later . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to help . 
 All you have to do is ask for help . 
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Does the class start again , Mam ? 
 Oh , breaktime flies . 
 Mam , another minute , could I ? 

Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu . Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ? 
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? 

Mike ! Look at the floor ! 
 What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! 
 It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . 
 What are you looking for now ? 
 Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin . 

Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
 Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . 
 Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? 
 Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 
 Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? 
 Oh , dear ! 
 It's not what I asked for . 
 It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 

So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 
 Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . 
 Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . 

Sorry . What was that you said ? 
 Where ? 
 When , did you say ? 
 Who's coming ? 
 Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There's a lot of noise outside . 
 Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . 
 Are you looking for somewhere for two people ? 
 Yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . Do you have any other requirements ? 
 How many rooms do you need in the flat ? 
 Ok . I've got a list of place that fit your requirements . Let's just go through them . The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university . 
 It's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a main street . 
 Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there . 

Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ? 
 What if there's something wrong with it ? 
 Are you sure ? 

What kind of place shall we rent ? 
 Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
 I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . 
 Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . 
 I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 
 Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . 
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . 
 It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . 
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 

So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ? 
 So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? 
 What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . 
 Are the rooms nice and bright ? 
 Do you have a balcony ? 
 You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? 

I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 

Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? 
 I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? 
 When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? 
 What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? 
 So I need plenty of space for this exercise . 
 Great . Thanks for you advice ! 
 Sorry . You know the rules . 
 That ’ s out of the question . 
 Not a chance . 
 Sorry , it ’ s impossible . 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 

Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is . 
 Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair . 
 Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . 
 Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know . 
 Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that . 
 I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information . 
 This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is . 
 How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality . 

Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 

Excuse me . 
 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 
 Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . 
 I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . 
 Black or dark brown . 
 Straight , I think , and about average length . 
 Well , he had a jacked or a plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear . 
 Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . 
 Boots 
 No , hiking boots . Brown ones . 
 Now I want you to look some pictures . 
 Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
 Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
 Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . 
 Please I'd like a ticket to New York . 
 No , early saturday morning . 
 Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty . 
 No , exactly not . 
 Sounds not good . I won't take it . 
 No , I'll have the fish please . 
 No , I want the fish . 
 Thank you , but I prefer the fish . 
 No , I like the fish . 

Excuse me , sir ? 
 I'm afraid you can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes here ? 
 It says ' No smoking ' . 

Are you going out again ? 
 You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . 
 No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . 
 OK . Here's the key . Take care . 

How beautiful the flower is ! 
 You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . 
 Where it is ? 

I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room . 
 What sort of price are you asking ? 
 Would it be convenient to see the room ? 

Good morning . May I help you ? 
 All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ? 
 How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins . 
 E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ? 
 1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ? 

Good morning ! May I help you ? 
 Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ? 
 Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? 
 I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . 
 Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences . 
 Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 
 Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? 
 Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there . 
 Why not ? 

May I come in ? 
 This seems a pretty nice room , I should say . 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . 
 Next Saturday at the earliest . 
 Good morning . 
 Just take a little off on the top and shorten the back . But please don't make it too short . 
 Just to the bottom of my ears . By the way , I'd like a shave , too . 
 How much is it ? 
 Here you are . Thank you and goodbye . 

I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff . 
 I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time . 
 I prefer this kind of style . Can you make it for me ? 

Good morning . Do I need an appointment ? 
 Thank you . 
 I've been wearing my hair long for years , but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style . What do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ? 
 I hope so . I'm really tired of this old-fashioned style that I've been wearing . 
 Yes , if you think it will help . 
 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? 
 By all means . 
 Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . 
 The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . 
 I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . 
 Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? 
 I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . 
 Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? 
 Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . 
 Yes , please wait a minute . I'll fetch it for you . Here it is . Please try it on and take a look at the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 If you think so , we'll shorten the legs a bit . It'll take about twenty minutes . 
 You're welcome , sir . 
 Sure . May I take your measurements ? 
 I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ? 
 Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ? 

Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . 

Where to , ma'am ? 
 The Grand Hotel ? 
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . 
 Oh , yes . I know where it is . 
 Take me to the airport , please . 
 I have to be there before 17 o'clock . 
 There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
 Here's twenty dollars . 
 No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? 

Shall we share a taxi ? 
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . 
 That's the one . 
 Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ? 
 How about this one ? 
 All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ? 
 Of course . Let me help you . 
 $ 280 . 

Can I help you , madam ? 
 Would you like to try this one on ? 
 All right . How about this one ? 
 Of course , madam . 
 I'd like to buy a toy car for my son . 
 It looks nice . How much is it ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid it's too expensive . Can you show me something cheaper ? 
 OK , I'll take it . Here's the money . 

Can I help you , madam ? 
 Have you any particular color in mind ? 
 Red is very popular . 
 Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ? 
 Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens . 
 It's $ 180 . 
 These are our cheapest coats , madam . 
 Here's your change . 

Could I have some fish ? 
 Oh , spinach , I think . 
 Just a beer , please . 
 Would you like to have some more beer ? 
 Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it . 

May I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? These dresses are on sale . 
 Come this way . Here's the dressing room . 
 It looks nice . And it's not expensive . 
 It's only $ 20 . 

Excuse me , where is the nearest gas station ? 
 To the traffic lights ? 
 Left at the lights ? 
 Right at the bridge ? 

Excuse me . 
 Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
 Along Queen's Road ... 
 Right at the Hilton . 
 The Cathedral ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
 Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
 I'm looking for a pair of shoes . 
 I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ? 
 How much are they ? 
 I'll take them . 
 Good coming . Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . 
 It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself . 
 I have a suit that needs cleaning . 

Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the library ? 
 On Memorial Avenue ? 
 I'm afraid I don't . I'm quite new in town . 
 No , I don't . But I do know where the shopping mall is . 
 Well , thank you very much , I hope I can find it . 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . 

Good morning . Mrs.Smith . 
 Well , what kind of books does she like ? 
 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
 Do you know if she's read this one ? 
 Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 
 I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting . 

Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What are you looking for ? 
 Walk straight ahead until you come to the second traffic light . Then turn right . 
 I can't remember , but it's the second light . 
 I'm afraid I don't . But I do know the price has gone up . 

Can I help you ? 
 I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ? 
 There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . 

Can I help you ? 
 What kind of stamps do you want ? 
 I must weigh it first . Err ... It's five grams over weigh , Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ? 
 Registration plus overnight ... err ... seven dollars in all . 
 Now , your receipt , and the change . 

Hello , I've got a letter here that I'd like to post . 
 Well , the letter is going to a friend of mine in America and it's quite urgent . It really needs to be posted today , so here you are . 
 I do want to send it airmail , yes . 
 What's in it , please ? 
 OK . You may wrap it now . Please fill in this form and label it . ( after a moment ) Would you like it registered ? 
 Nine dollars and fifty cents . 
 Here's the receipt . 
 You're welcome . 
 Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ? 
 Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America . 
 Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost . 
 Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for . 
 The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt . 
 We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon . 

Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? 
 Is this the latest edition ? 
 What's the difference ? 
 Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please , 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind . But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . 
 One dollar . 
 Two stops after this one . 
 Sure . 
 No , a No . 50 will take you right there . 

I'd like to send this parcel to Spain , please . 
 Well , how long will it take if I send it by surface mail ? 
 Oh , dear . It won't get there for New Year's Day if I send it by surface mail . How much will it cost if I send it by air ? 

I have a package to post today . 
 Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape . 
 By airmail please . 
 Yes , I'd like to insure it for 20 dollars . How much shall I pay altogether ? 

Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic . 

Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . 
 Will you have it later ? 
 That's terrific . Thank you . 
 The next bus will be here in four minutes . 
 No , it's the number fifty-eight . 
 No , it won't . 
 Never . 
 That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . It's stop is round the corner . 
 Yes , they all stop at this corner . 
 You can take any bus except the Number 9 . 
 They run about every five minutes . 
 About fifteen minutes . It's not far . Are you a stranger in New York ? 
 How do you like New York city ? 
 You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus . Fortunately , it's not full . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . 
 Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . 
 You're welcome . 
 I'm going to the hospital to see Susan . 
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? 
 Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? 
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 

Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . 

Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
 Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
 Yes ... 
 Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . 
 Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? 
 Does this one look big enough ? 
 Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? 
 Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . 
 I'm figuring out my budget . 
 I'm making a shopping budget , so that I don't spend too much money . 
 I can only spend $ 300 a month . 
 I need to save the rest . 
 I need to pay my bills . 
 I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope . 
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
 We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! 
 No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! 
 umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday . 
 No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss . 
 That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous . 
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? 
 Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... 
 Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous . 
 Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! 

I want to go try on these clothes . 
 I found some jeans , and a new blouse . 
 What do you think ? 
 What about the jeans ? 
 I don't think so either . 
 I'll just buy the shirt . 

Mom , I'm ready for school . 
 I don't have a fever , and I'm ready for my test . 
 I'm fine , Mom . I feel so much better . I want to go to school . I'm missing out on all the fun . 
 Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! 
 I am returning something that I bought yesterday . 
 I'm returning a cellphone . 
 It's defective . 
 It keeps turning off on it's own . 
 I have it right here . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ? 
 Ok , I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies . 
 I found some coins that are not from here . 
 Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ? 

Can I borrow five bucks ? 
 Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday . 
 I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week . 
 Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me . 

I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee . 
 Let's take him some of Kitty's best and make the pitch again . 
 It's worth a shot . 
 What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ? 
 Well , it's more like she kept me busy ... 
 Am I back in your good books ? 

Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . 
 It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? 

I'm done . Can I watch TV ? 
 Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! 
 Do I have to take them ? 
 Yuck ! 

I am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . I was wondering about the size . 
 How is the condition ? How old is it ? 
 Why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ? 

Mom ! 
 I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this ! 
 But I feel better . 
 OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... 
 Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? 
 That's the beauty of it , and the danger . 
 How much ? 
 Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck . 
 Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . 
 I know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . You'll get too weak if you don't eat . 
 That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? 
 My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? 
 No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping . 
 Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . 
 Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . 
 Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! 
 Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down ! 
 That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . 
 OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ? 

My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month . 
 It still tastes fine , though . 
 Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ” 
 We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK . 
 Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops . 
 We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers . 

That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . 
 That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . 
 That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . 

Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days . 
 Sounds a little weak . 
 Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . 

Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ? 
 I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign . 

Balista , I'll have a frappuccino . 
 You and your fancy Italian names . 
 I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much . 

This motor oil case is still really slippery . 
 Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too . 
 So what ? 

Then I'll have to borrow it . 
 Why ? It's in mint condition ! 
 You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ? 
 I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! 
 Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room . 
 I guess you're right . And we'd like to have company anyway . 
 Now that's a plus ! 
 So what about the tennis racket ? 
 How much did that end up costing you ? 
 Hey , two for one . That's a super deal . 

So the apartment comes unfurnished ? 
 We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners . 
 Just like in the States ! That's perfect ! 

I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer ! 
 This is too good to be true . 
 Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . 
 We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . 
 What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open ! 
 It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? 
 Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that . 
 Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge . 
 This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . 
 I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . 

Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ... 
 Blow my nose ? 
 No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater ! 

See ? That wasn't so bad . 
 It might be sore for a while . You'll be OK . Now let's go home and rest . 
 No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice . 
 And vegetables with porridge . 
 This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . 
 Why is that ? 
 And the downstairs neighbors ? 
 Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then . 
 I made a doctor's appointment for you . 
 Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school . 
 Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup . 
 Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather . 
 But I don't have any reading assignments . 
 Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . 

This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! 
 OK , OK . 
 Maybe I'll run away first . 

Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? 
 I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! 
 Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! 

Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . 
 You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! 
 You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! 
 And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! 

Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny . 
 And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ? 
 That's great . And the garbage , too ? 
 Thanks for your help ! 
 Oh , great . Where was it ? 
 What was it doing there ? 
 You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? 

Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ? 
 No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ... 
 I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ? 
 It's more violent than TV news ! 
 Nine-thirty . 
 No time . That's their headlights in the window ! 
 Little dude , your life is over ! 

Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . 
 She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all . 
 You know , maybe she's just a neat freak . 
 You could be right . 
 Sure , if you're done ! 
 Well , listen , Honey , you've been a big help lately ... 
 If you take out the garbage and do the dishes , I'll think about it . 
 Nothing in life is free , Son . 

So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ? 
 That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish . 
 I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ? 
 Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . 
 What about veggies ? 
 It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! 
 Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? 
 You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? 
 Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? 
 You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! 
 You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . 
 OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . 
 All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . 
 Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? 
 I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . 
 Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! 
 Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole . 
 Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Sure , I ' ll have a Corona . 
 Sure , do you have the receipt ? 
 Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
 I see , and what about the keyboard ? 
 I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . 

Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? 
 Trev , are you OK ? 
 Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . 

Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? 
 I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! 
 I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! 
 A what ? 
 Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough ! 

I found it at a garage sale once . 
 Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . 
 Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five . 

Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? 
 Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? 
 Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ... 
 And Steve is going to look after you until we come back . 
 Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro . 
 No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places . 
 How did you get it ? 
 Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks . 
 Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks . 
 OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer . 

Hello . Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself . 
 My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry . 
 I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars . 
 It's a deal ! 
 What ? I sent you three or four messages ! 
 Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . 
 I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? 
 No wonder you didn't get my texts ! 
 Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please . 
 Tonight at seven . 
 In that case , eight o'clock is fine . 
 Four people . 
 Mark . 
 Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . 
 You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol . 
 It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on . 
 You are a lost cause . 
 Almost , let me just put my apron on . 
 Got it . 
 Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? 
 OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? 
 Done . So how long do we bake it for ? 
 Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! 
 I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . 
 It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . 
 Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! 

What's for dinner ? 
 What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? 
 Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? 
 Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . 

Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . 
 Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . 
 Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . 
 Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . 

Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ? 
 Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ? 
 We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ? 
 We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes . 
 Will that be all ? 
 Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents . 
 Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . 
 That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . 
 A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , " Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks " . 

Look , Jimmy's report came today . 
 He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . 
 He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him . 

What did you cook ? 
 Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? 
 This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! 
 This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! 
 Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! 
 I'm stuffed ! 
 My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me . 
 A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . 
 Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife . 
 No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother . 
 I'll explain later , let's go . 
 Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . 
 What about Rubella and Mumps ? 
 OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! 

Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . 
 Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . 
 Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . 
 Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . 

I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . 
 Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . 
 Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . 
 I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . 

Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ? 
 I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . 
 We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . 
 Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . 
 Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . 
 I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . 
 The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . 
 But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? 
 Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . 
 Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . 
 Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . 
 Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . 
 Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . 
 Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? 
 I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? 
 Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? 
 Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . 
 All right . What varietal is that ? 
 And you think this is a good wine ? 
 Perfect ! I'll take it ! 
 You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here . 
 This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it ! 
 Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings ! 
 Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . 
 True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? 
 That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . 
 Uh ... no . 
 Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty . 
 From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought ! 
 Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now ! 
 I can't , I have to go to the gym . 
 Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy . 
 Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats . 

Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much . 
 Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous . 
 Really ? No , no , I couldn't ! You're too nice ! 
 Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much . 
 Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . 
 It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? 
 Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? 

OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ? 
 Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long . 
 I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle . 

Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here . 
 Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? 
 You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . 

How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun ! 
 An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia . 
 That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ? 

Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ? 
 It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik . 
 How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ? 
 Right . Cool ! Let's go ! 
 Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . 
 Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? 
 Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . 
 OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . 
 What size ? 
 Here we are . How does it fit ? 
 Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . 
 That's so great ! 
 This t . v is only $ 2500 . 
 That's how much this t . v costs . 
 This television is of very high quality . 
 By how much ? 
 I'm sorry , but the price is final . 
 What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! 
 Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? 
 What type of tools ? 
 Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? 
 Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! 
 What are you buying ? 
 I can check for you , if you'd like . 
 First , we need eggs , milk , and bread . 
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? 
 Get some snack foods . 
 My washing machine isn't working . 
 The water will not drain . 
 No , that's it . 
 When will you be able to fix it ? 
 That would be perfect . 
 See you then . 
 Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
 Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . 
 Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
 Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . 
 Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . 
 That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! 
 Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . 
 About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . 
 Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . 
 Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
 Have a great trip . 
 Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things . 
 No ! Five minutes I promise ! 
 Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation . 
 What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... 

Honey , can you set the table ? 
 Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . 
 Yeah , go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . 
 Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? 

Hello . I would like to buy some business cards . 
 Two thousand would be fine . 
 All I want is the same thing on this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card . 
 Do you think you could finish it in three days ? 

Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? 
 Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this tricky section . 
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad . 
 It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante . 
 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 
 That ’ s ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship . 
 No , thank you , I am not interested . 
 I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me . 
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 
 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 

We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
 Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
 What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . 
 We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . 
 I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . 

I need to purchase some business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be fine . 
 I want the new cards to be exactly like this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm done . Here's the form and my old card . 
 You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days . 

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 

Hey , what are you doing here ? 
 What are you shopping for ? 
 Same here . 
 I found a few pairs of pants . 
 I found them at Pennies . 
 Do you want me to show you where I found them ? 

Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . 
 Can you describe a mango to me ? 
 Do I eat the seed ? 
 What's the price of these mangoes ? 
 Tell me what they taste like . 
 Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ? 
 Where do mangoes come from ? 

Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . 
 Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ? 
 When do you want it delivered ? 
 What time exactly ? 
 We can have it to you at that time . 
 We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock . 

Where is some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 I've never had a mango . 
 Can you eat the stone ? 
 How much are these mangoes ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 What country produces them ? 

Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 
 We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 
 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 
 Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . 
 The mangoes are on sale today . 
 They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . 
 Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . 
 Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . 
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity . 
 They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe . 
 These are from Mexico . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it . 
 No . Peel the skin with a sharp knife , and throw out the seed . 
 Well , they're on sale today for only $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 You can buy them either ripe or unripe . Unripe ones are hard . 
 The ones that are on sale are from Central America . 
 What size pan were you thinking of ? 
 Well , this one might work for you . 
 Here , lift this aluminum pan . It's the same size . 
 Here's a similar aluminum pan . But it has a heat-resistant handle . 
 I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later . How would you like to pay ? 
 Oh , no problem . Here's the lid that comes with the pan .

I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! 
 Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . 
 Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies . 
 That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! 
 Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please . 
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number .

 That is a wonderful choice . 
 It's very inexpensive , and it has all the appliances . 
 The fridge and freezer is very spacious , and it also has an ice maker and water dispenser . 
 Take a look inside . 

Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ? 
 You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run some errands . 
 I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great nanny Amy . She used to work for my neighbors , before they moved away . She ’ s very responsible , a good cook , and great with kids . 

Hello , sir , what can I do for you today ?

 I need to buy a new refrigerator today . 
 I like that Kenmore refrigerator . 
 Tell me about it . 
 What are the appliances ? 
 I'd like to see it for myself . 
 I like what I see . 
 I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Marry . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening . It will be warm and humid all weekend . In the Midwest , expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees . 
 Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast . Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding , especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls . 
 It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . I advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . Back to you , Mark . 

I have to find a living room set . 
 I don't know . 
 Where did you go to find yours ? 
 Does the furniture from IKEA cost a lot ? 
 How good of quality is the furniture ? 
 I don't mind paying for quality workmanship . 

I'm going to buy a new living room set . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Are they expensive ? 
 Is the furniture crafted well ? 
 I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for . 

Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest .

Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ? 
 Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , please sit down . Coffee ? 
 Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then . 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? 
 Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract . 
 Where are you going to find one ? 
 Do you want to know where I bought mine ? 
 I got it from IKEA . 
 It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set . 
 The furniture is built extremely well . 
 Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic . 
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . 
 This is gonna be a great barbecue ! 
 Do you know how many you need ? 
 We can get started as soon as you fill out this form . 
 You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass . 
 Very good . You can pick up your order in one week . 
 We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra . 
 Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . 
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? 

It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? 
 Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! 
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 

I need to order new business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be enough . 
 I don't want to make any changes to my old card . 
 ... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model . 
 I need it sooner . Let me have it in three days , okay ?

Hey honey , how was your day ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . 
 Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . 
 I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . 

What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? 
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! 
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! 
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! 

Hello sir , how may I help you ? 
 I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? 
 Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . 
 Mmm , well this is our “ I ’ m sorry I cheated on you ” package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .

 Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house . 
 I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . 
 Do I have to pay an installation fee ? 
 Awesome ! 
 I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay . 
 Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy .

 You can find anything ! Are you sure you want to start shopping online though ? Once you step into this world , there is no turning back ! 

Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . 
 Great . How much is this going to cost ? 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile . 
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 
 All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! 
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
 It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! 
 I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . 
 For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! 
 Well , they took us along with some paramedics . There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! 

Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? 
 That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . 
 Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . 
 Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . 
 Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . 
 As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . 

Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! 
 Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... 

I need a pan . 
 Well , the bigger the better , I think . 
 Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . 
 Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . 
 Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . 

I'd like to purchase a pan . 
 Well , I cook a lot of big meals . 
 Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy . 
 Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . 
 Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . 
 Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ?

 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
 Fine . 
 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 
 So what do you think it is ? 
 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank !

 I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo as the car . 
 Yes , miss . What was the problem with your purchase ? 
 Would you like to have them altered ? Or would you like a different size ? 
 I'm sorry , but this was on sale , so I can only give you store credit . 
 Of course ... here you are . I'm sorry the pajamas didn't work out for you .

 Mmmm ... I'll have to think about it . 

How's the bride-to-be ? 
 Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! 
 Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . 
 I will . Don't worry ! 
 What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
 You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? 
 Cool ! 

OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ? 
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . " 

Excuse me , I wonder if you can help me . 
 I'm completely lost . I'm looking for the Empire State Building . 
 Great . Thanks a lot . 
 There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . 
 Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . 
 Yes , of course . I'll take it . 
 I like it . 
 How about the Japanese ones ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll show you some . 
 Can we go somewhere nearby ? I don't feel like walking too far . 
 I mean the food for something spicy . 
 That sounds great . I love Korean food . 
 I think Pond's is the best . 
 They're on special offer today . 

Drive me to Kennedy Airport , please ? 
 Where is the next taxi stand ? 

Could you show me my bill ? 
 Can I have it charged to my account , please ? 

Are you being served , madam ? 
 Sit here please.How would you like your hair done ? 
 Do you want a cold-wave or perm ? 

Could you take us to the Fifth Avenue ? 
 Is the traffic very heavy this hour ? 

Hello , sir . I'm ready for you . 
 Yes , please sit on the chair.How do you want to have your hair cut ? 
 OK.Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face . 
 Which dish do you like most ? 
 Actually , it's the dish recommended by this restaurant specially . 
 That's all right . 
 I'd just like a trim and don't make it too short . 
 A little trimming , please.Trim a little more above the ears . 
 Here you are . 
 I'm sure you'll look grand when it's done.Would you like to have a shampoo after a while ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 

May I serve your dishes now ? 
 With sugar ? 

I'd like to have steak and a beer . 
 Well-done , please . 
 Anything's all right with me . I'm not particular about soups . 

What're you going to wear today ? 
 You'd better tuck in your shirt . 

Do you want a shampoo ? 
 What brand do you prefer ? 
 All right , miss.This one is very hot . I'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.Will that be alright ? 

Do you think this blouse really suits me ? 
 Not too tight in the waist ? 

What's it made of , could you tell me ? 
 Can it wear well and keep its shape ? 

Could you pass me the jacket with wide lapels ? 
 What do you think of it ? 

Do you have this design with only one breast pocket ? 
 It's a pity . I'm afraid that's too loud for me.Thank you . 

Sorry to trouble you . Can you tell me how to get to the City Bank ? 
 How long will it take if I walk ? 

Excuse me , can you tell me where the post office is ? 
 I'm afraid I don't quite understand . 

Is there a bookstore near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 How long would you like to keep it ? 
 Yes , that'd be all right . 
 What for ? 
 All right.Here ' s the money . I suppose I'll have to drive you there . 
 One to the beach . How much is it ? 
 Sorry . I can wait a moment . 
 Thank you . 
 Sorry , I'm using it myself.But you can use it this afternoon . 

Would you be kind enough to lend me forty pounds ? 
 That's all right . 
 Cross the street and walk two blocks west.You can't miss it . 

Can you loan me fifty dollars until pay day ? 
 Thank you just the same . 
 Single or return ? 
 A return ticket is forty-six pounds fifty . 
 A cheap day return ticket ? 
 That'll be twelve pounds . 
 Yes , I'll have tomato soup and my friend will have mushroom soup . 
 Yes , bring us two steaks and two loads of bread , please . 
 No.May I help you ? 
 Oh , that's where I'm going . 
 Steak , please . 
 Well-done , please . 
 Yes , I just forgot where the bed linens department is . 
 Thank you . 

Can I help you , madam ? 
 Certainly.Here you are.They ' re the very latest fashion . 
 They're of good cotton and the color never fades . 
 What size do you want ? 
 How about this one ? It's the latest design . 

May I help you , sir ? 
 Take a look at the ones on display , please . 

Good morning , sir , Can I help you ? 
 Oh , we have many kinds.Do you like this design . 

Does the material stand washing ? 
 Is it drip-dry ? 

Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted.Have you ever seen such a nice house ? 
 This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new . 

Excuse me , please show me that business suit , the dark one . 
 May I try it on ? 

I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 
 What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . 

Manhattan Square , please . 
 I'd like to go around the city , if you don't mind . 
 Here you are.Which size do you wear ? 
 Of course.You look terrific in it ! 
 How about these famous brands ? Such as pierre Cardin ... 
 Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . 
 Pierre Cardin . 
 It look fine.Can I try it on ? 
 $ 135 . 
 I'm sorry , sir.The price is fixed . 
 That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there.We ' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us . 
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 
 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . 
 The plumbing seems OK , too.The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water , and the sinks don't seem to leak . 

Have you got any cheaper ones ? 
 That's more reasonable . I'll take this one . 
 Well , that's an hour's ride.Why not just post your mail here . 
 I see . 
 No , sir.Can I help you ? 
 Oh , hop in . 
 Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds just wonderful to us . 
 How about this afternoon ? 

I wish to order 100 sets of hifi.Do you have this service ? 
 Sony please.Do you have extra charge for delivery ? 

I'm after some chinese incense burner ? How's this one ? 
 Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight . 
 Oh , this is fine . 
 An old book Death on the Nile.Have you read it ? 
 Sure.But you need to be patient . 
 Yes , I'd like to make reservation for tonight , a table for five , please . 
 Around 8 . 
 Frank London . Any chance of a table by the window ? 
 I'll appreciate it if it could be arranged . 
 Scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea . 
 No , thank you . 
 OK , thank you . 
 That'd be nice . 
 Oh , yes.What do you recommend today ? 
 OK , I'll have it for change . 
 Sure , which one ? The red one or the blue one ? 
 You may keep it for the time being . I'm not using it now . 
 What'd you like , madam ? 
 No , just a few minutes . 
 I think our smoked fish will be to your taste . 

Could you show me what you've got ? 
 We'll try one of your specials this time . 

I would suggest roast beef , sir . 
 We have clear and cream soup at your choice.Which one do you prefer ? 

Evening , table for three , please . 
 Yes , I do . I have made reservations under the name of Wang . 
 No smoking , please . Could we have table by the window ? 

Could you send up a Coke and a salad ? 
 Make them with French dressing . 

Here comes the last course ! Shall I help you to the dish ? 
 But I can't resist a good dinner . 
 No , I'm afraid we'll have to cancel the order . I'm not sure whether it agrees with me . 
 I'd prefer swordfish steak . 
 Oysters , please . 
 Sure . It's very close actually.You go straight down this road . Then you turn left , at the next junction . 
 Bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . You see it as you turn left.Seriously , You can't miss it.It ' s enormous . 

Should we tip ? This service is pretty good . 
 How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars . 

Can I take your order please ? 
 Sure . Anything to drink with that ? 
 Eating here or to go ? 
 That's 7 dollars and 25 cents . You can get free refills with your coke . 
 The salmon is good toady , it's very fresh . 
 It's cooked with lemon and savored with rice . 
 You're meal also include soup and salad . 
 French onion soup , sir , what dressing would you like for your salad ? 

Can I bring you anything else ? 
 Let me get this . 
 Are you sure ? 
 All right . If you insist . Next time it is on me , though . 
 I'd like to have it in big waves . 

I want to take a photograph . 
 I like one taken half length . 

It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you've had to wait . 
 OK , It's here , one of the best makes in China . 

Don't use a hair spray . I want my hair set and dried . 
 That's all right.Thank you . 

Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . 
 You should at least give me a call . 

Is it Fred's fault ? 
 But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
 Yes . There's one on the corner of 23th street . 
 Just walk north for 3 blocks . It's next to the Mexico restaurant . 
 Oh , very close . Maybe 5 minutes walk . 
 Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time . 
 You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time . 
 Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that . 

This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate . 
 So it has attracted more and more customers these days . 

So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window . Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 

Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ? 
 The Grand hotel , is it far from here ? 

Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? 
 Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
 Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 

Would you like some cake ? I made it myself . 
 Thanks . Would you like to have one more slice ? 

Is this taxi taken ? 
 Please take me to this address . 

May I have a look at that vase , please ? 
 Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . 

Hello ! 
 Sure , just a second . Who's calling ? 
 Ok , sue , I will just go in get her . 
 I am sorry . I can ’ t hear your very clearly . Could you say that again , please ? 
 Mark Wyatt ? I am sorry . The line is terrible.Could you spell that for me , please ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Got it . I haven ’ t heard of the name.Could you hold on the line when I check . 

Hello , Is this EYE computers ? 
 Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . 
 Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . 

This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price . 
 No . 10 % is my last word . 

Hi , I'd like two tickets to Providence , please . 
 What time does the next train leave ? 
 Ok , could you give me two tickets for that ? 

Hello , can I help you ? 
 Sure . We have one on the second floor . 
 This is the first floor . The second floor is one level up . 
 That's just over there . On the right . 
 Yes , we do . That one comes in green blue and red . 
 Oh , that's 39 dollars and 95 cents . It's on the sale at the moment . 
 I'll just go and check for you . 
 I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player . 
 Yes . The DS102 series . 
 Will you be getting more in . 

Excuse me . Do you mind if I try this on ? 
 Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ? 
 Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color . 

That'll be 12 dollars and 95 cents , please . 
 Oh , you don't have anything smaller ? 
 Oh , sure . Credit card is fine . 
 Un .. Those are 25 dollars each . 
 Well , I could offer you maybe 10 percent off . 
 This one I'd better chat with the manager . Could you give me a second ? 
 I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one . 
 I see . Maybe I can offer you a credit note . 
 OK , sir . I'll see what I can do . 
 Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks . 
 No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . 
 Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ? 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I wasn't planning on spending that much money today , so ... 
 Even if an item is on sale ? 
 Oh ! It's so cute ! 
 Is it a Chinese New Year's gift or a birthday gift ? 
 Oh , I see . Let me guess ... something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage ? 
 Well-endowed ? Don't worry . I have some bras with bigger cup sizes in the back . 
 Does all that come to 10,000 NT ? 
 Where do I sign ? 
 OK . 
 Well , the teddy bear is for me ! 

Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
 What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 

OK . I'd like to have everything gift-wrapped , please . 
 Is it on this floor ? 
 Thank you . 
 You , too . Thanks for your help . 
 It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . 
 He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! 

I don't know , but he gives me the creeps . 
 But what if he knows my name , where I live ... 
 Actually , he's really good-looking . Too bad he's a weirdo . 
 Now he's looking over here ! He's coming ! 

The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident . 
 Not really , but they are on the rise . 

Look ! Allen has the mike ! 
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias ! 

Hi , again . Can I get you some more fruit ? 
 OK . I'll go then . 
 If you give me your credit card , I can take care of it for you . 
 If I hear " Love Me Tender " one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! 
 Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . 
 Hey ! Where are you going ... ? 
 I don't know what happened ! 
 No , I didn't . Really ! 

Um , hello again . Are you sure you don't want to make a purchase , sir ? 
 Hush ... OK . What is it ? 
 What kind of question is that ? 
 Uh ... yeah , right ... 
 What ! 
 It's my new radio earphone . 
 What were you screaming at me for ? 
 No you don't ! I should treat my new brother-in-law ! 
 OK , OK . On one condition . 
 You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat ! 

Uh ... that's Greek to me . 
 Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . 
 So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . 

Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! 
 What a cool see-through blue ! How do you wear this thing ? 
 How do I turn it on ? 
 It's all in the bag . 
 I need that to relax . I'm going to put a few drops in my bath water . 
 They all have essence of flowers in them . 

Besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine . 
 Just the necessities 
 No , but you never know when you'll need a flashlight . 

When you smell them , they affect your nervous system . 
 You can do that , too . Both methods have a healing effect . 
 Ha-ha ... I'm just fatigued . And tomorrow is a big day . 
 More sales ! 
 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
 You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
 It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . 

That way they look longer . 
 Putting on mascara . 
 I won't . 

What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ? 
 So let's start by checking off what we've already done . 
 Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net . 
 Hey ! We're paying for his ticket ! 
 Oh , how high class ! So you just wear it forever ? 
 Is it dry yet ? 
 They look fake . 

There's so much to do and so little time . 
 Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium ! 
 All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted . 

Hey ! Ask your mom for more old pictures , OK ? 
 But we saved your parents so much money ... 
 Speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations ! 

What's in the box ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you ! 
 Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! 
 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 How about " As long as You Love Me " ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! 

Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 
 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 
 Then after a few beers , you'll be singing in Taiwanese ? 

Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! 
 You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! 
 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! 
 Trust me . She'll keep nagging . She thinks something will go wrong . 
 You guessed it . She says we have to get married on January 2nd , or we'll have bad luck . 
 My mom just wants everything to be perfect for us . 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 
 OK . How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 

Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Actually , uh , I made it myself ... 
 Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else ! 
 Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan ! 
 Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us ! 

Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ? 
 Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates ! 
 Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . 
 Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time . 
 It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ? 
 You know , art is something I've always been interested in ... 

Taylor , you're looking a little pale . Are you sure you want to hand out nametags ? 
 True . Keep up the good work . Hello , welcome to the reunion of the Class of ' 93 . 
 And don't forget to put in an order for your reunion memory book . 

Did you like the Chanel bag that I got ? 
 I bought it on eBay . It was only one-tenth of the original price . And the purchase was so easy . 
 Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky . 
 Then you haven't browsed eBay before ... get online . Don't hang up ! 
 Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night ! 
 The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday . 
 But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor ! 
 Uh ... Andrew . Hello . I can't quite remember you . 
 Um ... we never were . We're just friends . 
 ... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ... 
 Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating . 
 I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad . 
 OK . Wish me luck ! 
 Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . 
 I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! 
 Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises . 

So , got any more ideas for the website ? 
 But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there . 
 You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . 
 Any other ideas ? 
 And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... 
 No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! 
 Good for you . What items did you bid on ? 
 Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me ! 
 That's not how this game works . 
 How many bids had been placed before you ? 
 Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . 
 Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag . 
 They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... 
 I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble . 
 Maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid . 
 Yes . You'll get a picture of Serena playing with the racket and a document from her . 
 What ! 
 Don't you dare tell me that ... 
 Well , they should have called you ! 
 And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 
 It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! 
 Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! 

OK . I just saw a Versace for thirty dollars . This stuff can't be real ! 
 I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number . 
 Sure , but it's so complicated . They asked for my credit card authorization number . 
 I have trouble understanding all these forms ... but I'm sure I'll get it . 
 Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ... 
 Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . 
 Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ? 
 Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ? 
 I'm sorry , Mom . 
 Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you . 
 I know . Goodnight . 
 Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping ! 
 No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... 
 Not unless you lose about 100 pounds ... 

What in the world is that smell ? 
 Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? 
 Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? 
 The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! 
 So soon ? 
 OK ! Hurry , then ! Here's my cup . I can't wait for step four ! 
 Yes , there is , drinking your coffee ! 
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 
 Let's go ! 
 Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! 
 So ? 
 You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ... 
 The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ? 
 They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship . 
 Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch . 
 They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ? 
 They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred . 

OK ... well , then how much is one jin ? 
 30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ? 
 Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs . 
 This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ? 
 Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ? 
 And how about these little brown chips ? 

I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . 
 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... 
 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
 Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with . 
 Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night . 
 It's a football game the school team plays at home . The dance and reunions are usually that night , too . 
 Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today . 
 How has school been going ? You come home so late every night ! You're really a hard worker ... 

Isn't this fun ? 
 Just follow the foot movements . Brush left , brush right ... yeah ! That's it ! 
 Let the men take the lead ! 
 Oops ! 
 Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . 
 I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? 
 Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year . 
 Yep . And relive those good old high school days . 
 I'm not . I get a stomachache just thinking about it . 
 Ouch , that hurts — did you have to mention her name ? 
 I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star . 
 Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . 
 A cup of coffee and an apple pie . How about you ? 
 Why don't you drink coffee ? 
 It does taste weird . 

Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ? 
 Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop . 
 Thank you for your help . 

Could you come and help me mend the computer , Neel ? 
 I can't log on the internet again . 
 No , never . 
 I don't have this kind of software . 

Good morning . 
 I'm not quite hungry now . Let me think for a while . 
 Ok , Ok . Toast and egg . 
 No . 
 The aroma of roasting coffee beans . 
 Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . 
 This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... 

Let's see now . Cut the potatoes into small cubes . 
 On the bottom shelf in the cupboard under the sink . 
 Donna ? Well . She is about 20 . She is very lovely and I think you will like her . What about Paul ? 
 Could you get me the pepper from the cupboard ? 
 It's in the small one beside the cooker . 
 Oh , there Isn't ? Oh , no . 
 OK , Mr . Coffee Connoisseur , so what's the next step in the coffee-making process ? 
 Let me guess , Mocha , Mandheling , and Santos ! 
 No , I just read the names off the packages ... Ha ! 
 Yes , you can find it at the entrance . 
 Ok , I'll get one for you . 
 Here it is . It ’ s really hard to find a shopping cart at this moment . 
 We make deliveries only for bulk buying . 
 No , but the charge is rather low . 

Operator ! Operator ! 
 Yes , I was talking to a party . We were disconnected . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , what kind of apartment are you interested in ? 
 Yes , I have one . When you need it ? 
 Well , It's a one-bedroom apartment . The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit . You pay electricity only . Gas and water is included . Both the heat and stove are gas . Let me see , what else ... Oh , you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge . And that's probably it . 
 Sure . What time would you like to come ? 
 Good , May I have your name , please ? 
 Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow . 
 Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute.Here you are . 
 Of course not . Let me check . Oh , you seem to be correct . 
 Only ten percent of taxes included in the bill . 
 It sure does . 
 What's that supposed to mean — that it's weak ? 
 Mmm ! Beer , tequila , and ... lime ! 
 Fresh tomatoes , green and white onions ... 

I'm famished ! Let's get some grub ! 
 Me , too ! The chips here are so light and crispy . 
 I'll go get the chips . What do you want to drink ? 

Hmm . Not bad . I think I look younger with shorter hair . 
 I just want a light wave . I look really silly if my hair is too curly . 
 Super . How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap ? 

Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . 
 Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . 
 I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . 
 No problem ! 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . 
 Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . 

Are these all yours ? 
 Cash or credit card ? 
 Not yet . Oh , Madam , this item is no longer on sale , and this goes on sale tomorrow . Will you take them ? 
 Sure , it is 80 yuan in all and you have to give me another coupon . 
 Certainly . 
 Okay . Input your pin number , please . Sign here . 
 Here's your receipt . 

Would you please weight this letter for me ? 
 How much ? 

Hello , this is 5735647 5 . 
 This is Linda . 
 Really ? What time and which restaurant ? 
 Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ? 
 Thank you . Bye . 

Hello , 35 .. 
 Speaking . 
 I am sorry . I am very tired . I'm going to bed early . 
 No , I ’ m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I'm in a hurry now .

 Ok . 
 Can you give her a message , please ? 
 Please tell her to give Colin a call when she gets back . She has my number . 
 Thank you for your help . 

Excuse me ! 
 Yes , I'd like to send this book to France . 
 Can it go in an envelop ? 
 Do I need stamps ? 
 When will it arrive ? 

I'd like to have these shirts washed and ironed . 
 Yes , heavy starch in the collar , please . 
 I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . 
 Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . I'd like to get my laundry . 
 Here you are . 
 Can you sew on these buttons ? 
 How much for the shirts ? 
 Here is the money , keep the change . 

I'd like to buy a bottle of Centrum , a dozen tooth brushes , some baby's wipes , and a small bottle of aspirin . 
 Give me one bottle of one hundred tablets . 
 Can I have a look at them ? 
 Are they cheaper ? 
 So if I buy a dozen , I'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ? 
 Good . I ' ll take a dozen of them then . 
 Baby's wipes . Johnson's .

 No kidding ! We have only 5 bottles of beer . 

Hello , I bought a pen in your shop just before . 
 Now I came back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pen is broken , I am afraid . 
 Would you change it to a new one ? 
 Yes , I do .

 I'm afraid we have no more sole . 
 Certainly , just a moment , sir . 
 Did you have hotel card or something ? 
 Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right . 

By the way miss , where is the toilet ?

I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . 
 You see , there is a run at the neck . 
 No , thank you . 
 Would you like those with yogurt ? 
 What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus . 
 It ’ s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ’ s good for you ! 
 I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . 
 It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie ! 
 But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside . 

I'm a little nervous . 
 You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ? 
 Just in case , right ? 

This is exciting ! Thank you so much ! 
 Boy oh , boy ! This is so cool . Let's rock and roll ! 
 Which one of these is the gas pedal ? 
 When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant . 
 I wouldn't mind having one myself ... 
 OK ! 

Should I go now ? 
 Nothing is happening ! 
 What do these other letters mean ? 

What is this ? I didn't order that . 
 I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . 
 Hey ! What is this ? 
 Oh , Is that what this is ? 
 No , don't replace it . Give a refund . 
 Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup . 
 Thank you . 

Who is the next ? 
 All right . Over here , sir . How are you today ? 
 How do you want you hair cut ? 
 Yes , sir . I will use the scissors.Do you always part your hair on the left ? 
 That will be 3.50 dollars . 
 Thank you very much . Come back to see us . 
 Yes , we ’ Ve got a reservation . The name is Ann . 
 This is your table . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , let me have this roast beef special . 
 I will have the green peas and make sure the beef is well done . 
 A cup of coffee , please , with cream and sugar . 
 Oh , yes . 
 What comes with the special ? 
 I think I will have a dish of Vanilla ice cream . 
 Waiter , may I have my check , please ? 

Excuse me , I'd like to try some Chinese food . 
 I know nothing about Chinese food . Could you give me some suggestions ? 
 Is there any difference ? 
 How about Sichuan food ? 
 Oh , really . I like hot food . So what is your recommendation for me ? 
 Thank you . 

Excuse me . Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is ? 
 Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street . 
 Thanks a lot . 

Good evening . Do you have a reservation ? 
 How many people are you together ? 
 Would you like to sit in a smoking section , a non-smoking section or whatever comes open first ? 
 I am awfully sorry but there are no vacancies left now . Would you like to wait for a moment ? 
 I think about ten minutes . 
 I am sorry for making you wait so long . Now there is a table available in non-smoking section . Please follow me . 
 This is the menu . Are you ready to order now ? 
 Yes , and what would you like to drink ? 
 Would you like a dessert ? 
 Lemon pie , hot cake in syrup , chocolate sundae and custard pudding . 
 All right . I'll bring your soup right away . 
 Yes , but dinner was excellent 
 No , thank you . Check please . 
 Here is the two dollars , will you bring me the receipt ? 
 Please keep the change . 

Excuse me , sir . But please call an ambulance . My friend suddenly got a sharp pain in the stomach . 
 Oh , is there ? Will you find someone to take us to the hospital then ? 
 Yes , he is . 

Hi , my name is Violet . Come with me , and I'll help you wash your hair . 
 I'll pick a shampoo that's just right for your hair type . Sit right here , and rest your neck on the side of the sink . Is the water too hot ? 
 Let me know if I'm using too much force . 
 OK ! You're all set ! Come back with me to your seat , and Eva will be right with you . 
 How about two inches ? 
 I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks . 
 Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you . 

This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 
 Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! 
 You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! 

It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! 
 You mean half-and-half ? 
 Good idea . 
 I feel so good . That warm hot pot certainly hits the spot on winter nights . 
 Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place . 
 You're going to have a little Montezuma's revenge tomorrow morning . 
 No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it . 
 Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change . 
 I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day . 
 Should we ask Cindy to come along ? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much . She didn't buy it of course . It would cost her three months ’ salary . 
 When ? 
 Oh ? Isn't that like her . 
 All right , all right . I am ready to go . Let's go ! 
 Yes , I did . By the way , in case there is a flaw in this CD player , can I return it ? 
 Is there a charge for that . I know other stores have a restocking fee . 
 Thank you . 
 Thanks . I'll put it in a safe place . 
 Do I have to get up now ? 
 What are you talking about ? The alarm hasn't even gone off yet . 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 Just let me sleep five more minutes . 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 Sure , I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm , this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it . 
 Yes , this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ’ m now sleeping on is saggy . 
 Does it come with a frame ? 
 That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it . 
 No , I'm not . I am interested in some scarves . 
 Hm , It looks nice , but I ’ d like to have something warm for the winter . 
 I think that's what I want . How much is it ? 
 It's a little expensive . Do you think it's possible to get a discount ? 
 That's good . Could you wrap it for me ? 
 No , that should be it . Thank you ! 
 Yes , we are . Could we have the check , please ? 
 Do you accept checks ? 
 Well , I don't have any cash with me , so I ’ ll have to put it on credit . 
 Ok , please wait a minute . Can I have my food packaged ? 
 Thank you . 
 Thanks for reminding me . It always slips my mind . 
 Cool ! That's a great idea . What did you have in mind ? 
 Don't tell me , socks . 

How much did you pay for the TV ? 
 200 bucks for a piece of junk like that ? That's a ripped-off . 
 It's not worth it . 

Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel . 
 Every thing for winter is 20 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section . 
 You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to the right . 
 It's ok . 
 Well , I am looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee . 
 Really ? What's that ? 
 I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ? 
 I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this . 
 I don't think the green one fits her complexion . Do you have any skirts in light color or tan ? 
 Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ’ s check ? 

Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ... 
 Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once ! 
 Whatever . Give me another pack . 

How long do you plan on staying ? 
 We are open from nine to nine . So be sure to be back by then . 
 Alright . There's a spot open at the far end of the lot . Here's your parking stub . 
 Please drive slowly . 
 Too bad . I did anyway . 
 I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ? 
 Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating . 
 Go ahead . Waste your money . 
 Well , I don't ... anymore . 
 I didn't say I was going to deprive myself . 
 Excuse me , madam ! You parked in the handicapped spot . 
 Don't tell me you lost it . 
 That was quick . 

No-no-no , sorry ! That's a handicapped parking space . Are you handicapped ? 
 Sorry , but you'll have to park in a normal space . 
 Be patient , miss . It'll just be a second . 

Hey ! A real cook gets down and dirty . Besides , I think I look good covered in baking mix ... 
 Well , your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker . 
 I know . You just add milk , eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir ... 

Are you making what I think you're making ? 
 What a nostalgic food ! 
 No . Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown ... 

Yes . Of my mother standing in the kitchen and me doing my homework before school ... 
 OK ! I'll show you how my mom did it . 
 Yeah , and it's bigger than ours was . 

Where is the shelf of best-sellers ? 
 Could you give me some advice on books for killing time on the train ? 
 Yes , very much . Which one is the latest ? 
 Thank you for your help . 

Can I help you ? 
 What kind ? 
 Sorry , madam . We have stopped selling those kinds of eggs for a week . 
 You know , red yolk is proved unnatural . It's artificial , and may lead to cancer . 
 Yes , so they are no longer being sold . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of grapes do you want ? 
 Ok , wait a moment please .

 This one . How do you like it ? 
 Sure , this way please . 
 I want to buy a bottle of perfume for myself . 
 I don't like strong perfumes . 
 I don't think it smells nice . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Sure . The bittersweet perfume has a calming effect on the nerves . 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll take it . 
 Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white . But you have freckles on your face . 
 I recommend Nisei products . This brand has a face cream which is effective on fading freckles .

 I'm afraid there isn't . 
 Good morning . I want to buy a lipstick for my wife because it is her birthday today . 
 Light pink . 
 I'd like her to have a change . 
 It is nice . Is it water proof ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . Could you help me gift wrap it ? 

That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ? 
 We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? 
 What style do you want ? 
 Oh , I see.How about the color ? 
 I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters . 

I would like to have a custom-made skirt . 
 OK . I want it a bit close around the waist . 
 How long will it take ? 
 What ’ s the charge for the tailoring ? 

Well , I ’ d like to have my coat to order.Will you take my measurements ?

Can I help you ? 
 We have various colors . How about this one ? 
 You have a very good taste . It's our best seller . 
 Sure ! Look , it suits you well . 
 Yes . I'd like to buy a sweater for my husband . Which style is the latest ? 
 I like this style . But do you have any other colors ? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion . 
 Great ! I will take it . And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater ? 
 Let me see . Yes , they are perfectly matched ! 
 Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it . 
 Any starch ? 

Am I ever hungry ? When will supper be ready ? 
 All right . 
 Yeah . Oh , it's delicious ! 
 Definitely . It's a wonderful meal . Thank you , Honey . 
 I wish I could , but I won't . 
 Yes.Will you check if my suit is ready to go , please ? 
 Bill Smith . 
 No , it ’ s a dark brown suit . 
 Right . 
 Thanks . 
 What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
 You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? 
 Cool ! 

Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Actually , uh , I made it myself ... 
 Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else ! 
 Thank you.But it is too bright for me . 
 Let me try it on . I like that color . 
 But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks . 
 No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . 
 Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ? 

Look at the catalogue , John . I think I want to get this red blouse 
 Yah , but it doesn't have a red one . 
 Yes ! 

Can I help you ? 
 Yes.There are two colors . 
 Yes . 
 Anything else ? 

This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think I could fall asleep ! 
 I'll have whatever you're having . 
 Well ... the beer sounds good ! 
 I'd like a pair of sports shoes . 
 I just like jogging . 
 Er ... , that blue pair . I need size 43 , please . 
 Very comfortable . I'll take them . 
 Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time . 
 You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time . 
 Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that . 

Honey , could you help me operate the VD player ? It can't play . 
 I think so . 
 I'm too careless . 
 No . 
 It's a new disk . 
 Here you are . 

My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place . 
 Do you know any places ? 
 Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . 
 I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . 
 It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . 
 I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . 
 Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? 
 Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . 

Can I help you ? 
 I recommend Pioneer . 
 This model is very popular with ladies . 
 Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings . 
 No , but we have it in yellow . 
 Please wait a second . I'll get it for you . 

What kind of car is best for me ? 
 The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ? 
 That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ? 
 You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? 
 With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for . 

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . 
 Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . 

Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ? 
 An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ? 
 So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ? 
 It sounds so complicated ! 

This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate . 
 So it has attracted more and more customers these days . 

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
 Some what ? 
 No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? 
 Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? 
 What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . 

Excuse me ... 
 I would like to return this item ... Are refunds allowed ? 
 No , no ... It was just the wrong size . 
 No . I would rather just return it . 
 Yeah , right here . 
 No , thank you . 

It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? 
 The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... 
 Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? 
 Is it easy to get lost ? 

So how ’ s everything going for Christmas ? 
 What ’ s that ? Don ’ t tell me you ’ Ve still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . 
 He still doesn ’ t know that Santa isn ’ t real ? How old is he , eight ? 
 You think it ’ s better that he should be told ? 
 That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn ’ t real . 
 Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that . 
 Do we have to ? 
 It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere . 
 But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down . 
 I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . 
 I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . 
 Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree . 

How do you like this one ? It's nice and cheap It's only thirty-four dollars . 
 Sorry . I think that's the cheapest 
 Yes . you can The fitting room is right over there . 

Do you know the circulation of this magazine ? 
 Oh , yes , how's it ? 

I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . 
 He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . 
 Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . 
 It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . 
 I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . 
 I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . 
 And what does your husband do ? 
 But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard . 

Who finances the magazine ? 
 Does it have a large circulation ? 

Good morning .

 Well , it's just drip drip drip . But that's not water . 
 Did you call the apartment management yet ? 
 How long ago did you do that ? 
 That's outrageous ! I just don't understand why they're not on top of this . 
 Yes , I know . 
 Oh , no . We just did it last week . 
 I'd rather wash the clothes . 
 Oh , My God ! So much !

 I learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble ’ s Department Store . 
 I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . 
 I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . 
 Here ’ s an interesting ad , For rent . Two-bedroom , unfurnished house , fenced yard , one-car garage . Pets OK . 
 The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . 
 It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . 
 Good morning . 
 To the airport please . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's ten pounds . Keep the change . 
 You're welcome , Goodbye ! 
 But newspapers do get some extra income by offering space for ads . 

Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? 
 Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . 
 So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? 
 Well , you ’ re in the right store . If they don ’ t have it , no one will . 

Can I help you ? 
 The Times is a must . 

Excuse me ! 
 We're ready to order . A cup of coffee for me , and a glass of oranges for her . 
 Just black coffee . Do you serve anything else besides drinks , say cake .

 I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . 
 Yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? 
 Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ? 

Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? 
 You ’ re not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? 
 Then how can you explain your behavior ? 
 Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? 
 On a cell phone ? 
 That ’ s definitely true . I ’ m going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . 
 Yes , the bus doesn ’ t go there directly.You have to take the No . 26 bus for five stops and then change to a No . 16 bus and get off at the third stop.When you get off , you can see the bank . 
 It ’ s about an hour . 
 Not at all . 
 I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it . 
 That's why it's interesting . 
 It was chosen as the most popular magazine of the year . 
 As far as the language is concerned , it's worth reading . 
 The paper editorials always stick to the quick . 
 After all , I'm somewhat conservative . 
 But I like its color . 
 I'll take one , too . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 But it's Sunday , isn't it ? 
 It's OK . I can always get a clear picture on it . 
 You'd better have it fixed . 
 Sure , Mum.In a minute . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 What do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ? 
 I'll buy an electric map of the city . 
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . 
 I promise you'll have it tomorrow .

 About $ 25 , tips not included . 
 Oh , yes , sure . Let me put it in the boot . 
 Not at all . Bang the door , please . 
 You are in luck . The traffic is not heavy today . 
 Let me see . A roasted duck is $ 25 . A plate of pork is $ 6.50 . A bowl of beef is $ 7 . Two bottles of beer are $ 4 . That's a total of $ 42.50 .

 In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . 
 Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . 
 I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? 
 In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . 

Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . 
 I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . 
 Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . 
 In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? 
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 
 Hey , Anna , this is Jason . 
 Yes . How are you , Anna ? 
 Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . 
 Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . 
 You are kidding . 
 A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . 
 She is very nice and open-minded . 
 Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots . 
 Good . Tonight 8 o'clock . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , what seems to be the problem ? 
 I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ? 
 Where exactly did you use your passport in the store ? 
 Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . 
 You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it . These kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up . 
 Here you are . 

Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here . 
 My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road . 

Can I see the doctor ? 
 No , I don't . 
 Well , I am spending my vacation here and I have a stomachache and ... 
 I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ... 
 No , not for this country . 
 No , I didn't think I ’ d need it . 
 Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain . 
 I know . I am sorry that I yelled at you . 
 Oh , that's easy . Go to www.onxiu.cn . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope . 
 That one , the one that says Mail . 
 Don't worry . See where it says , New User ? 
 Click on that . 
 Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest . 
 Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ? 
 Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ? 
 Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side . 
 Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it . 
 Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it . 
 Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker . 
 Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi . 
 You are welcome . 
 We'd better see if he is ok . 
 He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing . 
 Hello ? Yes , someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes , my friend is performing CPR . Ok , thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here , let me help . 
 I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long . 
 But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am . 
 I didn't see it . 

My watch always gains ten minutes a day . 
 No kidding . 
 You know what you can do ? 
 No , you don't have to . You only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day . 
 Yes , that's what I am doing . 

Good afternoon , sir . Please sit here . 
 How would you like your hair cut , sir ? 
 Very well , sir . Do you want me to trim your beard ? 
 Now have a look , please . Is it all right ? 
 Is that satisfactory ? 
 Do you want conditioner ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 You should go to the counter , just over there . 
 Yes . I went to Hawaii on a vacation with my husband . 
 We came back the day before yesterday . I enjoyed myself there very much . The beach is beautiful . You should go there some day . The sun was lovely , too . 
 I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style . Actually , I ’ m thinking about a perm . My sister is getting married next month . I think that if I have a perm now , I'll look very natural by then . What do you say ? 
 No , I don't like short hair . I like this one . The wave looks beautiful , and it fits my age too . 
 No , you can take your time . Oh , I also want a manicure while I am having the perm . 
 Thank you . How much will this cost ? 

Hello , is this apartment management ? 
 Yes , this is the tenant of apartment ten . I guess my kitchen sink is clogging up again , and so is the bathtub . 
 Um , I'd really appreciate it if you send someone over to fix it today . It's really a bother . I can't cook or take a shower . 
 Thanks , I appreciated it . 
 It's clogged and water won't go down . 
 Well , I guess people who lived here before didn't clean the bathtub . 
 What should I do now ? 
 Ur , it stinks ! 

Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here ! 
 I guess not , huh . 
 You should have moved out long , long ago . 
 So how can you stand the heat ? 

Gosh ! The water faucet is dripping badly again . 
 I know . I ’ Ve got to get it fixed ASAP . 
 I wish I could , but I ’ Ve got to go now . I have an appointment in 20 minutes . 
 Oh , by the way , could you give me a ride ? My car is still in the garage . 

Excuse me . I've been waiting here for 15 mins . Do you know how often does No . 3 run ? 
 It seems that you have got here at a good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? 
 I see , thank you . 
 Get on , PLS . Where do you wanna go ? 
 All right , Miss . I think we will get there if there are no delays on the way . 
 According to the kilometer rate , the first five kilometers are 4 dollars and every kilometer extra costs 50 cents . 
 Here we are , Miss . 
 You owe me 19 dollars . 
 Thank you ! 
 I think there is an accident ahead . 
 I know . Why don't we take a different route ? 
 Ok , let's do that , even though we may have to take a longer way . 
 Premium or regular , Madam ? 
 No problem , Madam . Should I check the air in the spare tyre as well ? 
 Should I clean the windshield for you ? 
 All right , Madam . It's ok . There is hardly any water in the radiator . It's dangerous , Madam . You could break down , because of the heat you know . 
 Anything you say , Madam . 
 No , we don't . I am sorry . It's 30 dollars and 10 cents in total . 
 Thank you , Madam . Have a nice drive ! 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 Sure . Will you be long ? 
 Go ahead . It will be safe with me . 
 I am sorry . I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 
 Not me . You know money always burns a hole in my pocket . 
 Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . 
 No , I need my books . 
 Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less . 
 All right . That sounds fair . 
 Why ? 
 Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out . 
 That's 1,825 dollars . 
 3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 . 

Where is my back pack ? 
 I just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone . 
 Of course , I am sure . I bet someone stole it . 

Ten sheets of rice paper , 25 brushes , two boxes of oil color and two boxes of water color . All these come up to $ 35.50 , sir . 
 Sure , just a minute . Are you an artist , sir ? 
 That must be a very interesting job . 
 Do you ? Nice to meet you ! And here is the invoice and your change . 

Can we have a table for three , please ? 
 Do you have a table for four , please ? 
 We'd like a non-smoking table , please . 

Hello , can I help you ? 
 What color and what style do you like ? 
 Well , you can have a look at our skirts hanging there . 
 You are welcome ! 
 It's our anniversary today . I am looking for the same flowers as the ones in her wedding bouquet . 
 White . 
 They are short , I guess . About the same height as those short flowers over there . 
 No , they look like little bells . 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 Ok . How many do you suggest ? 
 Yes , they are . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't , sir . 
 But sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK , I will blow . 
 But I ... 
 Oh , no ! 
 Do you have some new perfume ? 
 Well , I wanna buy some new perfume . 
 That's all right . 
 Can I open it ? 
 It smells sweet . 
 Really ? How much is it ? 
 Ok , I will take two bottles . 
 No , thanks . 
 Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? 
 I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . 
 Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? 
 Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . 
 I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . 
 May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? 
 Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . 
 Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . 
 There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . 
 China Hotel . 
 Well , I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 All right . What do you want me to get ? 
 Okay . How much ? 
 How many ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Okay . How much do you want me to get ? A gallon ? 
 Is that all ? 
 Yes . That's small bag of sugar , four oranges , and a half gallon of milk . 
 I think so . 

Excuse me . Could you help me ? 
 I'm looking for a leather belt for my husband . 
 Size 36 . . . I think . 
 Dark brown , if you have it . 
 Yes . I'm sure he will . I'll take it . 
 Do you take Master Card ? 
 Oh . In that case , I'll pay cash . 
 This is Mary speaking . Who is that ? 
 Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . 
 Yes , I am going to meet a client . 
 I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . 
 I thought Henry usually did the conferences . 
 I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . 
 I ’ d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ? I would hate you to make your boss angry or even lose your job . 
 Why did you stay an extra night in Boston ? What happened ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Ruth ? Basil . 
 Want a ride to the office ? 
 Hold on . Just 5 minutes . 
 It's my pleasure . See you . 
 Hi , Ruth . Hop in . 
 Of course I don't mind . For your report ? 
 Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio 
 Yes , I ’ ll have the Texas chili burger . 
 A large , with tons of ketchup . 
 I ’ ll have a diet coke , please . 
 Take-out , please . 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
 You need a babysitter . 
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
 Why not ? 
 I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 

This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . 
 Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . 
 Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? 
 Just pick something and get the hell out of here.Um , I'll go with these two.This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with.She better thank me for this ... 
 Finally ! 

Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 
 We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 
 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 
 Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . 
 we need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . 
 just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . 
 I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? 
 ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . 
 ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? 
 let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything . 

Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? 
 Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . 
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s 
 Never mind that.Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki.If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles . 
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 
 Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . 
 How much is this going to cost ? 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile . 
 no , I haven ’ t . I can ’ t think of anything to get him . 
 I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly ! 
 that doesn ’ t sound like a great present . 
 let ’ s think . He loves football , doesn ’ t he ? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear . Let ’ s go and have a look . You know which team he supports , don ’ t you ? 
 it ’ ll be an expensive present , but we can share the cost . 
 yes . He always get us special gift . We should repay his kindness . 
 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 
 Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? 
 I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . 
 They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . 

in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . 
 yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish 
 well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea 
 well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . 
 Oh hello , Sally . This is Dave Thomson here . Could I speak to Jim please ? 
 Any idea when he might be back ? 
 OK . well , tell him I've called , will you , and I'll try again later . 
 Thanks then Sally . Goodbye . 
 sure , here you are . 
 yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . 
 Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u 
 I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt . 
 exactly . 
 I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there . 
 well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . 
 how much do are you looking to spend ? 
 looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . 
 anything you need to have in the place ? 
 you can also check out university bulletin boards . 
 not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . 
 good luck . 
 What size do you take ? 
 I'll measure you . . . You take size 6 . What colour hat would you like ? 
 Here are some nice brown hats.Try this hat on.It ' s a very good one . 
 It's $ 9.95 . Do you want me to put it in a box ? 
 It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . 
 you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . 
 don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . 
 no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . 
 alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . 
 just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? 
 great . Bye . 

Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 
 that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 
 true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . 
 yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w 
 I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . 
 it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . 
 she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? 
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . 
 but I think they're dull , aren't they ? 
 well , cats are certainly more independent . 
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? 
 Poor cat . 

I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just 
 but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 

oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . 
 yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? 
 when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . 
 make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . 
 that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . 
 exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . 
 it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ? 
 I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home . 
 sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order . 
 it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . 
 stirred will be fine . 
 thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ? 
 can you recommend one ? 
 it sounds interesting . I'll take one . 
 it tastes great . 
 yeah . 
 I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and I had to wait for half an hour at the bus stop 
 But number 13 buses leave from the centre of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . 
 look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . 
 that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . 
 that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? 
 then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . 
 You really should go to Rachel's pet store . 
 it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
 snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . 
 Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 
 but it will pose a risk to your health . 
 i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . 
 I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . 
 yes , good luck , Maria . 
 No , there isn't , but there are some vegetables . 
 No , there aren't . I'm sorry . 
 There's a little bread and there are a few biscuits . 
 All right , I'll walk to the village and I'll get some meat . 
 You'll cook it of course ! 
 I bought it online . 
 yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . 
 yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 
 and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . 
 yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . 
 sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . 

Don't throw paper on the floor , Bill . 
 Put it in the waste-paper basket , please . 
 In that case , take the basket outside and empty it . 
 Where did you empty the basket , Bill ? 
 Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri . 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 Someone ought to clean it today . 
 No , he cleaned it last time . It's your turn . 
 Oh dear , is it really my turn ? In that case , I'll clean tomorrow . 
 Then I'll clean it the day after tomorrow . 

OK darling , got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! 
 Humph ! Right , so what did you get ? 
 Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ? 
 Oh , so organic vegetables are the green option , right ? 
 Wait a minute , that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? 

Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ? 
 When do you expect him back ? 
 Well , may I leave a message ? 
 Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? 
 I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . 

How about this floor lamp ? 
 We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . 
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 
 Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
 Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please . 
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . 

Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? 
 It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? 
 Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . 
 No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . 

I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! 
 Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . 
 Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies . 
 That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! 
 I need ten 55 cents stamps and ten 32 cents stamps , please . 
 Yes , I need to send the payment to immigration for my aunt's citizenship application . They won't accept checks.How do I send the money ? 
 Then I need a money order for 250 dollars . 
 Thank youse much for all your help . 
 You , too . 
 Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan . 
 How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ? 
 That's too long.How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ? 
 Then how much is that by airmail ? 
 That's a little bit expensive . 
 I guess I have to send it by airmail . 
 Yes , please . 
 OK . 
 They wanted to go out , and so they made me look after my baby brother . 
 No , I didn't . My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework . 
 Not really . I watched television for an hour . 
 Boxing . It was excellent . 
 What did you do last night ? 

Hello . 
 Mick ! Nice to hear from you again . How are you ? 
 Oh , not so bad . I've been very busy , but I'm going away on holiday soon . 
 New house ? Really ? 
 Well , that depends . When is it ? 
 Well . . . I'm going away on Sunday morning . Very early . Will the party go Convery late ? 
 All right . I'll come . But I'd like to bring a present Something for your new house.What would you like ? 
 But I'd still like ... 
 Yes , it has . I'm looking forward to seeing you . too . and your new house . Uh . . . when does the party start ? 
 Yes . Oh . by the W .. 
 Wait a moment , Mick . You haven't . . . Mick ? Are you still there ? You haven'tgiven me your new address . Hello ? Mick ? Hello ? 
 It depends where you live , sir . 
 Yes , we deliver there . But it costs two pounds fifty . 
 Morning or afternoon ? 

Mom , give me a glass of orange juice . 
 Oh , sorry mom , i forgot.please give me a glass of orange juice . 
 Oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice . 
 Oh , sorry again , thank you mom . 

Do you think children watch too much tv ? 
 Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . 
 They could go out and play with their friends . 
 Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too . 

Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? 
 How often do you run your anti-virus program ? 
 Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? 
 That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 
 What do you use your computer for ? 
 Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them . 
 Well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , DVDs , and a lot of nice clothing , too . 
 Good idea , let's shop to we drop ! 
 Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp . 
 Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool . 
 Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties . 

Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . 
 I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . 
 When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? 
 When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things . 
 That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time 
 Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will 

How often do you use the internet ? 
 Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . 
 Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . 
 I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . 
 What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . 
 Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . 
 This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
 I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
 It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ? 
 I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
 I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . 
 I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
 The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
 That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
 Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . 
 Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things . 
 No ! Five minutes I promise ! 
 Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq 
 What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... 

May i help you ? 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yes , the fitting room is over there , it looks fantastic on you , this style color in sizes natural here and figure , perfectly . 
 I think so , but the true thing is you look sharp in any style . 
 Absolutely , i go to there to work three times a week , bend it for 6 month now . 
 Oh , you like the rolling machine . 
 No problem , is this blue ok ? 
 Yes , we do , there is a 90 percent for two . 
 The total is 90 dollars including tax . 
 Yes , we do , debit or credit ? 
 Please keen your key number here , do you want to any extra cash back ? 
 Have a good day . 
 Great , take care . 

Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in . 
 Perfect ! I like this one . 
 Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ? 
 That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 
 Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ? 
 Great ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . 
 Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . 
 What about Wi-fi ? 
 One last thing . Is it waterproof ? 
 Are you trying to lose weight ? 
 You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . 
 Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . 
 Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . 
 Don ’ t count on it . 
 Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
 When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! 
 Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ? 
 OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week . 
 OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely . 
 Certainly . 

Welcome to Bill ’ s Fabric World . What can I do for you today ? 
 Sure we do ! We have the best tailors in the country ! What is it that you need exactly ? 
 Excellent ! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.How about we get you measured ? Let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . Now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .

 OK.Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . Please follow me . 
 Hold on there , Fittipaldi , first let ’ s go over things one more time . Now before you even think of starting the car , make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly . Next check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly . 
 Fine , start the car . now gently step on the clutch and shift to 1st gear . Good , now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it . There we go , good ! 
 Keep your eyes on the road ! No music ! We are coming up to a red light , step on the brakes . What are you doing ? I said the brakes ! Look out for those people ! Get off the sidewalk ! 
 It ’ s the police ! Pull over ! 

Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ? 
 We ’ Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ? 
 Ah , well then I ’ d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR . 
 Sure thing , follow me . This here is the . 
 Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option . 
 Oh , well this one has the , uh . 
 So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ... 
 Polarizing filter um we should ! I ’ m sorry , ma ’ am . It looks like we ’ re sold out . 
 Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters . 
 No problem , ma ’ am . 
 I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please . 
 Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ? 
 No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here . 
 Is this salami and bologna you have here ? 
 Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . 
 Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today . 

Hello sir , how may I help you ? 
 I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? 
 Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . 
 Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . 
 I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? 
 Get out of my store , you jerk ! 
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
 Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! 
 Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . 
 This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! 
 I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . 
 So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? 
 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
 You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 
 No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . 
 How many students are in the class ? 
 So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry . 

Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ? 
 Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps . 
 Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! 
 Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! 

Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ? 
 I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . 
 Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . 
 Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . 
 I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US . it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . 
 Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . 
 There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ regiving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan . 
 Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option . 
 That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... 
 Um . Ten ? 
 I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party ! 
 Mom ! That is so unfair ! 
 What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding ! 

Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? 
 What sort of pest are we dealing with ? 
 Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu 

Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ? 
 Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.Coffee ? 
 Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then . 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? 
 Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract . 
 Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . 
 Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? 
 Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . 
 OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . 
 What size ? 
 Here we are . How does it fit ? 
 Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . 
 Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! 
 I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! 
 Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
 Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
 Yay ! 
 Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
 Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . 
 Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
 What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! 
 Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? 
 What type of tools ? 
 Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? 
 Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! 
 No , thank you , I am not interested . 
 I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me . 
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 
 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 

Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ? 
 You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so 
 I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great 

Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . 
 But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus . 
 Ok . Anything else ? 
 Um yeah.Sorry about that . 
 I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . 
 I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . 
 I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . 
 Yes , even in the winter . 
 Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! 
 Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! 
 Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . 
 Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . 
 No way ! 
 We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . 
 No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . 
 No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . 
 I'm a great cook actually . You will see . 
 Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
 Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . 
 Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . 
 Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . 
 Alright . 
 Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . 
 Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . 
 Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? 
 I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? 

Excuse me . 
 I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ? 
 Yes , but ... well ... 
 How do I use the machines ? 
 I see . Do the machines have soap in them ? 
 No . I don't have soap . 
 Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . 
 I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . 
 Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before . 
 Yes . 
 No . Never . 
 I'm nineteen . 
 My mother always did it . 
 I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it . 
 What ? 
 I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn . 
 Thanks . My name's Nick . 
 Thanks , Mom . Thanks . 
 I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second . 
 Alright , alright . I ’ m coming . 
 You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries . 
 Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! 
 Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast . 

Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . 
 Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . 
 But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 
 Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . 
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 
 Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . 
 You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! 
 You ’ re so picky sometimes . 
 I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
 It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . 
 So what do you see in there ? 
 Can you afford that much ? 
 Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person . 
 That means the apartment has furniture in it . 
 Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . 
 It's still pretty expensive . 
 Alright . What's the phone number ? 
 Got it . What else do you see ? 
 No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom . 
 Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . 
 Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . 
 Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? 
 Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ? 
 Mostly cassette tapes . 
 Kreng ? I've never heard of that company . 
 I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily . 
 Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks . 
 Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse . 
 How much is it ? 
 Can I test it out ? 
 It sounds great . I'll take it . 
 Thanks . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 

Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? 
 Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll take it . 
 Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . 

Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I & 
 I haven't even told you what it is yet ! 
 Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to concert tonight . 
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! 
 Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please ! 
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 
 That ’ s so unfair ! 
 Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . 
 Sure , that sounds good . 
 No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . 
 Perfect . Thank you . Bye .. 

The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
 Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ? 
 One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ? 
 Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ? 
 Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around . 
 That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ? 
 I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway . 
 Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal ! 
 I would like to rent a car with a good stereo . 
 Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time . 
 This is a Porsche ! 
 But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . 
 But how can you do that ? 
 Yes , it almost looks new . 
 Alright . 
 Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . 
 Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . 
 Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? 
 I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? 

Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ? 
 You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . 
 San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . 
 No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . 
 Do you still want the car , sir ? 
 It's a beautiful drive . 
 Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . 
 I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
 I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
 Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 

Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ? 
 Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? 
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 
 No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . 
 How many students are in the class ? 
 So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry . 

Can you finish your homework in ten minutes ? 

I'm sorry I scratched your car . 

Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! 

Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ? 

May I have a look at that vase , please ? 
 Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . 

Can you give me a hand with the dishes ? 
 I wash and you'll dry . 

Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening . 
 It looks delicious . 

May I help you , sir ? 
 By air or by sea ? 
 How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather . 
 This gift is the best for a man who has everything . 

I'm concerned about your car . 
 But I think I can help to fix it . 

I'd like you to do me a favor . 
 Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office . 

Sir , would you like some dessert now ? 
 Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious . 
 I am afraid there is none . 
 Fine . I will bring it right away . 
 Have you tried the Internet ? 
 Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom . 
 Go to yahoo.com and click on “ Travel ” and “ Tickets . ” They ’ ll be about a billion sites to look at . 
 All right . 

Ben , what are you doing ? 
 Why ? 
 Have you thought about graduate school ? 
 Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ? 
 Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . 
 No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway . 
 How much will it cost ? 
 Taxi ! ! ! 
 Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ? 
 Driver , 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . , please . 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know . 
 No , I ’ m afraid not . 
 Sorry . 
 I wanted to see the White House . 
 Oh , no . 
 Oh , well thank you very much . 

So how can I make it ? 
 But I ’ Ve gotta have the budge before anything else . 

Hello , Vicki . 
 Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . 
 What ? Seven hundred ? 
 No , one thousand at least . 
 You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right . 
 Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday ! 
 Yes . We ’ re having a special sale on this machine here . 
 No . It ’ s Swedish . Would you like me to demonstrate it for you ? 

Look , all you do is press that button and it ’ s ready to use . 
 Just make sure you never touch the wire . 

How are the children doing in your class , Jane ? 
 Which child is this ? 
 What a large child ! 
 And which child is this ? 
 What an agile child ! 
 Now which child is this ? 
 Mm . All my children hope to go to college . Right ? 
 I ’ m making a list of food and drinks . 
 What for ? For the party , of course . 
 We ’ re having a Valentine ’ s Day Party . 
 We ’ Ve invited all our sophomore friends from school . 
 That ’ ll be a big help . Well , here ’ s a list of some of the food you could buy . 
 Thanks . See you at five . Don ’ t forget to bring your valentine . 
 Take the A train south to the Liberty Ave . stop . You should be able to find it from there . 
 The southbound A trains say Brooklyn . 
 Yeah . Hey ? What are you doing ? Let the people off the train before you get on . 
 Jeez . Tourists . 
 Certainly , sir . How much rent did you want to pay ? 
 $ 520 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartments as inexpensive as that.We have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on Seventh Avenue . It ’ s near the station . 
 No . it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but no oven.There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it.The landlord lives downstairs.Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 

I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ? 
 Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ? 

Hi , I ’ d like to have my phone turned on , please . 
 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City . 
 John Smith . 
 Very well . 
 Fifteen minutes ? I ’ m sorry , but I ’ ll have to call back . I need to get back to work . 

Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . How much rent did you want to pay ? 
 $ 900 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartment as inexpensive as that . We have one apartment for $ 985 a month today , on Eleventh Avenue . It ’ s near the municipal buildings . 
 No , it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but there are not many cookers . There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it . The landlord lives downstairs . Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 ... 
 Ok , we would do as your requirement . And we ’ ll contact with you later ! 
 Where ’ s what wagon ? 
 What water wagon ? 
 That ’ s my wagon . I need the water to water my flowers in the yard . 

The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident . 
 Not really , but they are on the rise . 

My shirt needs ironing . Could you please help me with that , Mary ? 
 Please , I promise this is the last time . 

Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . 
 First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . 
 We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . 
 Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . 
 Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . 

Hello . I need to disconnect my phone , please . 
 At 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City . 
 I ’ m moving to a new home . 
 John Smith . 
 555-7658 
 623 West Side Drive . New York , New York . 
 Thank you , you too . 
 No , thank you . 
 On second thought , I will have a cup . 
 Sorry to hear that . Can we do anything about it ? 
 Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late . 
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . 
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 
 I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better . 

Good morning , Ms Chan . What can I get you today ? 
 Shoulder chops , Ms Chan ? 
 Would you like to choose a chicken ? 
 This one is our cheapest . 
 Yes , of course , Ms Chan . 
 It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? 
 Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . 
 Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . 
 Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? 
 Get new friends . 
 Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . 
 Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . 

We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . 
 Have you got the time , Tom ? 
 But you bought it only last month . 
 How long will it take us to get there ? 
 It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . 

Hello , this is Wal-mart . Can I help you ? 
 We close at 10:00 every day . And we open at 9:00 in the morning . 
 Same hours as on the weekdays . 
 Yes , it runs till the end of the month . But things are clearing out fast . 
 Thank you for calling . 
 Uh ... yeah . Hi ! Is Susie there ? 
 Oh . I'm sorry . But is this 321-9987 ? 
 I am really sorry . 

Hello , Barneys Garage . 
 He just stepped out . Can I take a message ? 
 I'll make sure he receives the message . 
 Thanks for calling . 
 Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? 
 Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? 
 Oh , you mean Canal Street ? 
 Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? 
 I cannot get hold of her yet . 
 See you later . 
 Yes . I need a belt that is kind of casual and kind of dressy . 
 All right . Thanks a lot . 
 No way . 
 It's out of the question . 
 But , Mom , I can't eat anymore . I'm stuffed . 
 It's not that I don't like your cooking , but I ate some cookies before we had dinner . 
 Yes . So am I . But what will he do after graduation ? He really needs to go to college . 
 I know that but he has to learn to be independent . He can't just keep living at home . 
 Well , I think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week . 
 OK , I'll do them . 
 What ? 
 No ! He hit me first . 

Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? 
 Is rice your staple food , too ? 

This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price . 
 No . 10 % is my last word . 

Look out ! A small boy is rushing out blindly . 
 You stopped just in time . Good for you ! 

have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ? 
 so , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ? 
 how old is the house then ? 
 sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? 
 do you have a big yard ? 
 is your house well-lit ? 
 how many rooms does your house have ? 
 I'd be up for that ! 
 I have just arrived in Scotland and I'm staying at a Youth Hostel . 
 He says he's just arrived in Scotland . He says he's staying at a Youth Hostel . You know he's a member of the Y . H . A . 
 The Y . H . A . , mun . The Youth Hostel's Association . 
 I'll write a letter soon . I hope you are all well . 
 He says he'll write a letter soon . He hopes we are all well . Love , Jimmy . 
 He can't write very much on a card , mum . 
 ok , what unusual food do you want to try ? 
 what's that ? 
 I don't know . I don't know what most of this food is ! 
 I'd like to have some vegetables first . 
 no , what is it ? 
 what do you use to eat it ? 
 that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ? 
 I'll try all of those . How do you know so much about International food ? 

Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? 
 Would you care for a drink before you order ? 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? 

What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 

Could I have my bill , please ? 
 I'm afraid there has been a mistake . 
 I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here . 

Excuse me , miss . Could I have something to drink , please ? 
 Is it possible to get a beer ? 
 You ’ re right . I ’ ll save the beer for when we land . One orange juice , please . 
 Where did you see it ? 
 You found an apartment in the ads ? 
 Tell me about the apartment . 
 How much is the rent for the apartment ? 
 That ’ s pretty cheap for out here . 
 Congratulations on the new apartment . 
 Yes ? 
 Pardon ? 
 Yes , it is . Thank you very much . 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . 
 I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . 
 Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion . 
 There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later . 

What do you think this flat ? 
 Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . 
 That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine . 
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . 
 May be we could get some new furniture , better stuff . 

This apartment is wonderful . 
 How much would I have to pay for rent ? 
 That ’ s way too much money . 
 How about if I pay $ 850 ? 
 I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 . 
 You can ’ t go any lower than that ? 

Do you like cooking ? 
 I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . 
 So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . 
 Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? 
 How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ? 

I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . 
 Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . 
 Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . 
 That ’ s fine . I would also like a few shirts and a jacket . I don ’ t need them specially made . Those shirts over there look very nice . Are they made of cotton ? 
 I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please . 
 Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card . 
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow . 
 I'm the manager . How can I help you ? 
 Why , yes , it is . Would you like to get a look inside the apartment ? 
 How about today at 6 o'clock ? 
 Sounds good . I'll see you at 6 . Do you want directions ? 
 If you like the place , you can fill out an application form . I'll bring one with me . 
 No . I won't need to see anything except your driver's license . 
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . 
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 
 I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better . 

This house is not looking all that great from here 
 I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here . 
 It is just too dark in here with so few windows . 
 The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space . 
 How many dogs live in this house ? 

Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house ! 
 It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place . 
 There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy . 
 Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . 
 What ’ s that smell ? 

Hi , can I speak with the apartment manager , please ? 
 I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street . 
 I would love to see it . 
 Yes , I will be able to make it then . 
 I used to live in that area . 
 That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ? 

How are you today ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today . 
 You have to make an appointment first . 
 Is this Friday okay ? 
 Yes , I will schedule you for that time . 

How ’ s it going ? 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 That won ’ t be possible today . 
 You can only view the apartment with an appointment . 
 Are you available this Friday ? 
 Your appointment for Friday at 6 pm has been confirmed . 

Could I speak to the apartment manager ? 
 I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent . 
 Yes , I want to see it . 
 That time is okay with me . 
 No , thank you . I go by there on my way to work . 
 That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ? 

What are your thoughts on the apartment ? 
 There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? 
 What problems ? 
 We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . 
 Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? 
 I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . 

What do you think about the apartment so far ? 
 You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ? 
 Like what ? 
 Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in . 
 Yes . Now what other problems do you have ? 
 Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking . 

How are you doing ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . 
 You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . 
 How does this Friday sound ? 
 That will be fine . 

Do you like the apartment ? 
 Everything is okay ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment . 
 I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me . 
 I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . 

I would love to rent out your apartment . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 That ’ s a lot of money . 
 What about $ 800 ? 
 I can ’ t pay much more than that . 
 That would be fine . 

I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went . 
 I am not sure what a home inspection is all about . 
 Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? 
 Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? 
 What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? 

What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ? 
 What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ? 
 There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . 
 I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . 
 I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ? 

Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ? 
 I never had a home inspection before . 
 I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house . 
 I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . 
 What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ? 

What would be a good day to finally move into the house ? 
 Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ? 
 The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color . 
 I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house . 
 Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in ? 

Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager . 
 I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available . 
 Yes , I would love to see the apartment . 
 Yes , I can be there at 6 . 
 Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood . 
 OK , should I bring anything with me ? 

I came in to see how my home inspection went . 
 I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . 
 The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month . 
 Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ? 
 Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ? 

When can I move into my new house ? 
 Will the utilities be turned on ? 
 I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned . 
 I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . 
 Can you help me on my move-in day ? 

so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 

I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please . 
 I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street . 
 Yes , I would very much like to see it . 
 I have no problem with 6 p . m . 
 No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like . 
 Should I bring anything with me ? 

can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . 
 first of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . 
 we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . 
 actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . 
 yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . 

I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? 
 I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . 
 Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . 
 Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . 
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? 
 new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . 
 that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? 
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be 
 I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . 

the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
 so , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam 
 how long did it take you to do the tiling . 
 I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 

Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do.We also eat a lot of lamb . 
 That ’ s right.They taste so good.We eat them with mint sauce.Have you ever tried them ? 
 I certainly can.If I can get some from the butchers , I ’ ll cook them for you . 

What do we need for the barbecue ? 
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ? 
 And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . 
 I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce . 
 How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ? 
 They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it . 

good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . 
 when did it first break down ? 
 is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . 
 ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . 
 part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily . 

Hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner.What would you like me to do ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small.Wow , you can chop vegetables really quickly 
 Which spices are you going to add to the meat ? 
 Yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons.of water.Ok , I ’ m really to do the meat.Should I cook it over a low flame ? 
 Right.What are you doing over there ? 

Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! 
 Thanks , Mom.Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake . 
 But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . 
 Ok , actually I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots.But I hate broccoli and cauliflower . 
 Thanks , Mom ! 
 What do you have ? 
 Can I have apple pie with ice cream ? 
 I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? 
 Ok.Would you like a drink too ? 
 Are you having any dessert ? 

Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed . 
 You'd better get up , or you'll be late . 
 Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep . 
 Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead ! 
 The early bird gets the worm . 
 Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you . 
 That ’ s great to hear . 
 For each month you would have to pay $ 1050 . 
 I don ’ t think that is too much for rent . 
 That ’ s not enough . 
 $ 850 a month is not enough money . 
 That ’ s my final offer . Take it or leave it . 
 That would be wonderful . 
 The rent is $ 1050 every month . 
 What is good for you ? 
 That ’ s not high enough . 
 I can let it go at $ 900 a month . 
 I can live with that too . 
 The local newspaper has ads for housing . 
 Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . 
 Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? 
 You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . 
 Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . 
 Our school has a link on its website for apartments . 
 Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates . 
 Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ? 
 You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month . 
 I love apartment hunting . I ’ ll be happy to go with you . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that . 
 You will have to pay $ 1050 every month . 
 What can you afford ? 
 I ’ ll need you to pay more than that . 
 How does $ 900 every month sound to you ? 
 We have a deal then . 
 You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing . 
 There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate . 
 It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ? 
 That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . 
 I would be happy to look at apartments with you . 
 But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ? 
 I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . 
 Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . 
 Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . 
 I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . 

I would love to rent this apartment . 
 How much are you asking for every month ? 
 That is quite a lot of money for just one month . 
 What do you say to $ 850 a month ? 
 It ’ s either $ 850 or nothing at all . 
 Could you please go lower ? 

I found an apartment to rent . 
 I found it in today ’ s apartment ads . 
 I actually found it in the ads , and it ’ s not too expensive either . 
 All you really need to know is that the apartment looks great . 
 Every month I ’ d only have to pay $ 725 . 
 It is , isn ’ t it ? 

I'd like to help pitch in with dinner . 
 No , I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . 
 OK.Now how can I help , hon ? 
 Easy , I can do that with my eyes closed.Done . 
 How many potatoes do you need ? 
 Gotcha , OK . Here they are . 
 Where is the peeler ? 
 What ? Oh shit ! I cut my finger . 
 I guess cooking is not as easy as I thought . 
 Oh , really ? Where ’ d you find it ? 
 In the ads ? Are you serious ? 
 I ’ d like to hear about this apartment . 
 What is the rent each month ? 
 That ’ s amazing . The rent is very cheap . 
 It ’ s a good thing that you read that ad today . 
 Oh , Henry , I haven't seen you for ages . Come in . Let me take your coat . How are you getting along ? 
 Please take a seat . Everything would be ready in a minute . 
 Here you are . Here you go . We have cocktail and salad , fried chicken , French fries and icecream for dessert . Eating chicken while it's hot . it tastes better . 
 Here you are . Taste the French fries . 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Here is to our friendship and health ! 

You are late . 
 Couldn't get connection ? 
 Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right . 
 It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ? 

What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . we also eat mutton . 
 That's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ? 
 Certainly I can , I'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday . 

Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? 
 I don ’ t think we need too much in the way of soft drinks . Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ? 
 No , once I fill the tub with beer , I ’ ll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . 
 Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I ’ d rather die of thirst than drink champagne . 
 Yes , what would you recommend ? 
 It does sound wonderful , maybe I'll try it . 
 Not today , thanks . But I'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes . 
 Maybe I don't want the fish , I think I had the greenbean dish instead . 
 I'd like the egg drop soup . 
 Yes . 
 Just nice water , thanks . 
 Yes , please . I'd like the steak and mushrooms . 
 I'd like it well done , please . 
 I think i have bake potatoes.And i now have a ice tea with lemon on the side , please . 
 I'd like cream onion soup please . 
 I want to skip desert.That all , thank you .

I ’ m a new student . My name ’ s Robert . 
 Are you French ? 
 No , I ’ m not . 
 I ’ m Italian . Are you a teacher ? 
 What ’ s your job ? 
 I ’ m an engineer . 
 It is green . Come upstairs and see it . 
 Look ! Here it is ! 
 My hat ’ s new , too . 
 It ’ s the same color . It ’ s green , too . 

Come and meet our employees , Mr . Richards . 
 This is Nicola Grey , and this is Claire Taylor . 
 They ’ re keyboard operators . This is Michael Baker , and this is Jeremy Short . 
 They ’ re sales reps . They are very lazy . 
 This is Jim . He is our office assistant . 
 Which glasses ? These glasses . 
 These ? 
 Here you are . 

What are you going to do with that vase , Penny ? 
 Don ’ t do that . Give it to me . 
 I ’ m going to put it here , in front of the window . 
 There we are ! It ’ s a lovely vase . 

Hello , Helen . 
 How are you today ? 
 I ’ m fine , thanks . How is Tony ? 
 She ’ s very well , too , Helen . Goodbye , Helen . Nice to see you . 

Give me a book please , Jane . 
 No , not that one . The red one . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thank you . 
 What did you need to talk about ? 
 Like what ? 
 Your lease will be up in three years . 
 If you move out before then , you will not get your deductible . 
 Because our contract says that you will live here for three years . 
 I ’ m glad you understand . 
 Thank you . Yes , I would . 
 I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ? 
 That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight . 
 What about ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 In three years your lease will be up . 
 If you do , I will keep your deductible . 
 I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract . 
 I hope that I cleared things up for you . 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 What aren ’ t you too sure about ? 
 Your lease is for three years . 
 If you do , I will keep your deductible . 
 If you break the contract , then you will not receive your deductible . 
 All right . I ’ m glad I could clarify things for you . 
 It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . 
 Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? 
 Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . 
 How much do you think the rent will be ? 

Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? 
 The name ’ s Stanley Morris and the order was for two chef ’ s salads . 

What kind of a car do you have ? 
 I know it's old , but what make is it ? 
 Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new . 
 Would you like to look at my cousin's car ? 
 It's a coupe with a vinyl roof . 
 Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning . 

you're finally here ! What took so long ? 
 it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
 perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
 it would be better for the environment , too . 
 taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
 well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . 
 so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? 

we'd like to rent a flat near the university . 
 yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month . 
 net really , no . we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street . 
 we'll need two bedrooms . the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined . 
 how far away is it from the campus ? 
 that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . 
 thank you . that would be great . 
 Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . 
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . 
 It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . 
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 

that was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 
 I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? 
 ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 
 I'll have a cup of tea . 
 actually , could I have some milk with that ? 
 skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . 
 I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . 
 she's on the M40 , near Reading . 
 I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . 
 actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . 
 I will . Thanks a lot . 
 yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . 
 well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . 
 if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . 
 not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its 
 No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . 
 you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . 
 not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 what were you doing when it crashed ? 
 I think that might have been a virus . 
 what kind of computer do you have , a Mac or a PC ? 
 no , some people have Macs now , too . 
 PCs often crash from virus , but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac . 
 has your computer turned back on yet ? 
 did you end up losing any of your work ? 
 you should probably call the IT department and have them check your computer for virus . 

I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap . 
 I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors . 
 Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . 

do you like animals ? 
 what's your favorite animal ? 
 have you ever had a dog ? 
 they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ? 
 how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ? 
 how did that happen ? 
 you must have been devastated ! 
 I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ? 
 i hope your cat finds its way back home . 

when do most children start school in your country ? 
 How much time do primary school students usually spend at school every day ? 
 do they have to go to school on Saturdays ? 
 how many subjects do they have to study ? 
 do students have to wear uniforms in schools in America ? 
 did you go to a public school or a private school ? 
 I went to a boarding school from nursery school to senior high school . 
 yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! 
 that's true ! 
 Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . 
 That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . 
 There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner 
 They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce 
 That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . 
 But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . 
 Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive . 
 Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? 
 I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here . Let's look at the New Balance shoes . 
 Yes , that's it . That's their top model . 
 Well , we can wait for the assistant to help us , or we can look through the boxes down here . What is your size ? 
 Well , here you are . Size six . Woman's . 137 dollars.Wow , what a waste of money ! 

It's time for desserts ! Are you still hungry ? 
 what are you going to try first ? 
 do they serve the yogurt with anything ? 
 that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu . 
 ok . Mmm . 
 it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ? 
 what do you think ? Does it taste good ? 
 I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ? 
 do you know where they are from . 
 do you want me to get you one , too ? 
 ok , I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes . Wait for me here ! 
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 
 On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com 
 Why not , sir ? 
 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . 
 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 
 Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . 
 We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . 
 I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? 
 Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . 
 You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . 
 Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . 
 I want to leave . We've already been here two hours . 
 I would rather buy them somewhere else . 
 I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety . 
 Alright . 
 The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping . 
 Sure I would . 
 Do they have it in LARGE . 
 Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it . 
 Okay , I will try it on . 
 I look like a nerd . 
 Well , I don't think it's the best style for me . 
 Alright . Alright . 
 Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls . 
 It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . 
 We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . 
 Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! 
 Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . 
 The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . 
 Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . 
 Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . 
 Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . 
 Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . 
 After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . 
 Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . 
 It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . 
 Alright , sir . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . 
 Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now.But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colors do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is rose.How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . 
 Wow ! That's expensive . 
 I understand . I need some mascara too.Do you have a good thickening mascara ? 
 Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ? 
 Oh , sure . I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . 
 Thank you . 
 You could get him a tie . 
 Why not ? 
 Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . 
 He would think you were crazy , Caroline . 
 How much do you want to spend ? 
 Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . 
 Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . 
 I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . 
 I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . 
 We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . 
 She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . 
 How about the iguana ? 
 A tie ? 
 I was just kidding . 
 Yes , I want to buy a VCR . 
 No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son . 
 Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR . 
 Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university . 
 Please do . 
 Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use . 
 DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? 
 Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? 
 But isn't it more expensive ? 
 What's that ? 
 And why not ? 
 Hmm . Is that true ? 
 Well . And what about DVDs ? 
 Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film . 
 Alright , please show me what you have . 
 Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here . 
 No , it ’ s 777-9344 ? 
 That ’ s OK . 
 Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free . 
 Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . 

Where ’ s Sally , Jack ? 
 What ’ s she doing ? 
 Is Tim in the garden , too ? 
 I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . 
 What about the dog ? 

Excuse me , can I order now , please ? 
 I ’ d like the lasagna , please . 
 I ’ ll try the vegetarian , please . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , please . Christin . 
 Yes , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't like milk in my coffee . I like black coffee . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , please . 
 I ’ m making a bookcase . Give me that hammer please , Dan . 
 No , not that one . The big one . 
 Thanks , Dan . 
 I ’ m going to paint it . 
 I ’ m going to paint it pink . 
 This bookcase isn ’ t for me . It ’ s for my daughter , Susan . Pink ’ s her favorite colour . 
 Yes , of course I can , Penny . Is there any water in this kettle ? 
 Where ’ s the tea ? 
 I can see the teapot , but I can ’ t see the tea . 
 Ah yes , I can see it now . Where are the cups ? 
 Yes . Here they are . 

Do you have any shoes like these ? 
 Size five . 
 Black . 
 But my sister bought this pair last month . 
 No , she bought them in the U . S . 
 Can you get a pair for me please ? 
 They look very uncomfortable . 

What are you doing , karen ? 
 What do we need ? 
 What about vegetables ? 
 Have we got any beer and wine ? 
 I hope that you've got some money . 
 Well , I haven't got much either ! 
 Yes , please . 
 Beef , please . 
 I like lamb , but my husband doesn't . 
 Give me that piece please , and a pond of meet , too . 
 No , thank you.My husband likes steak , but he doesn't like chicken . 

What's Ron Marston like , Pauline ? 
 What did your boss say to him ? 
 Did he telephone again last night ? 
 What did you say to him ? 
 Did he telephone again ? 

Good afternoon . I believe that this house is for sale . 
 May I have a look at it please ? 
 How long have you lived here ? 
 Twenty years ! That's a long time . 
 Then why do you want to sell it ? 
 How much does this house cost ? 
 That's a lot of money ! 
 Well , I like the house , but I can't decide yet . My wife must see it first . 

Can I help you ? 
 Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . 
 Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . 
 Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? 
 Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your 
 Yes . 
 Yes . It's an excellent system . 
 Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . 
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . 
 Yes . 
 That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma 
 Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . 
 There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . 
 No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . 
 You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ? 
 Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ? 
 I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now . 
 So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ? 
 And do you usually part your hair along here ? 
 Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends . 
 The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy . 
 Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g 
 Of course . I have one I can suggest . 
 The problem is the split ends . 
 We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
 We need to find a good realtor . 
 What do you mean ? 
 But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
 I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has 
 So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
 And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
 Why ? 
 Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
 I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 

are you good at cooking ? 
 do you prefer chinese food or Western food ? 
 are you used to the food here ? 
 what's your favorite Chinese dish ? 
 have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ? 
 you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression . 
 if you want , I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes . 
 if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! 
 Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ? 
 Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey 
 Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages . 
 And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? 
 I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? 
 Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart . 
 They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . 
 Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . 
 I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store . 
 That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics . 
 Yes . Like stereos and televisions . 
 I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all 
 I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . 
 Yes , I would like to return these slacks . 
 Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week . 
 I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match . 
 Yes , they were thirty percent off . 
 I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . 
 I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here.Can you make an exception this time ? 
 Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me . 
 Here it is . 
 Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot . 

Morgan , can I ask you a question ? 
 I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . 
 what happen to all the leftover food ? 
 that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? 
 I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home . 
 no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ... 
 many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK . 
 that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! 
 I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! 
 I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . 
 I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . 
 I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . 
 aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . 
 my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . 
 I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . 
 the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ? 
 well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? 
 the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? 
 unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? 
 maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . 
 you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . 
 thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . 
 no , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ? 
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! 
 I know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . 
 yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? 
 what do we do first ? 
 ok . Should I heat the wok ? 
 what about the chicken ? 
 how about the rice ? 
 white rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! 
 yes . Which one is the brake again ? 
 I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . 
 you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! 
 I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? 
 that ’ s better . Now what ? 
 the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . 
 I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . 
 why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? 
 I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? 
 Right ! 
 Ok . 
 Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . 
 It sure looks special , looks expensive too . 
 Don't worry , Marian , I've got you covered . 

hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . 
 that's right . I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs . 
 well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . 
 posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . 
 how much do they cost ? 
 yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . 
 I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . 
 yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . 
 they look delicious . I think she'll be pleased . 
 I was going to eat in , I'm short on cash . 
 In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good . 
 Are you on the up and up ? 
 If you asked me , you've got a screw loose somewhere . 
 Fat chance , I'm too scared of bungee jumping . 
 What did that have to do with me ? I'm not the self-seeker like you . 
 I had a sneaking suspicion about you , Eric , I think you've lost it . 

Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? 
 Where to ? 
 Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . 
 Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . 
 Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. 
 That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . 
 You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that . 
 Yeah , you seem to like those styles . 
 This one looks really expensive though . 
 Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke . 
 Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary . 
 Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . 
 you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . 
 it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . 
 sure . How many would you like ? 
 are you sending them abroad ? 
 do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . 
 ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . 
 that ’ s another quid . 

how can I help you ? 
 do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? 
 ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes . 
 personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? 
 would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . 
 how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick . 
 how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . 
 I know what she would like---some whitening cream . 
 will that be all then ? 

we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? 
 let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? 
 I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . 
 sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? 
 what's in a dahl ? 
 that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? 
 that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? 
 ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? 
 you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! 

can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . 
 it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . 
 I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . 
 haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . 
 that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . 
 I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . 
 I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . 

alright , tell me what you think . 
 yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? 
 no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . 
 how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? 
 that ’ s even better than the real thing . 
 it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! 
 we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? 
 sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . 
 do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? 
 ok . What do you think about our living room ? 
 my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . 
 your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming . 
 that ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot . 
 not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . 
 I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . 
 really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . 
 do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? 
 I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! 
 I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . 
 I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . 
 no , I thought that would be included in the rent . 
 I don't think I can afford that . 
 that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . 
 no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time ! 
 ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ? 

How much is this ? 
 The large one . 
 Is this the only kind you have ? 
 Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide . 

ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? 
 what ? I don't understand . 
 Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' ! 
 ' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly ! 

Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? 
 Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? 
 I'll go myself then . 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . 
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 we ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . 
 like what ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 
 is the house pretty run-down . 
 was it very old house ? 
 is it in a good location ? 

it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . 
 I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . 
 well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . 
 fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . 
 I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . 
 do you have any money ? 
 for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . 
 I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! 

Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . 
 it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . 
 oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . 
 But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . 
 how about your mother ? 
 poor you . It seems we are in the same boat . 
 really ? so you don't have fried food at all . 
 how do you manage it ? 

what shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
 that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
 I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . 
 is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? 
 oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? 
 any other ideas ? 
 it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
 could you show me where the Chinese-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat . 
 oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ? 
 do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight . 
 ok , let me try it on . what do you think ? 
 really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ? 
 thanks . Who much would that come to ? 

Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ? 
 I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . 
 Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . 
 Seriously ? 
 Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . 
 But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body . 
 sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? 
 dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! 
 how about the Mongolian hot pot ? 
 maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . 
 yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . 
 wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . 
 the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . 
 absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day . 
 oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one . 
 Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . 
 certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique 
 Yes , Amy , please have some more . 
 You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ? 
 You didn't see the red light ? 
 Didn't you learn that red means stop ? 
 Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . 
 I'm giving you a ticket for this . 
 Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light . 
 As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ? 
 We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . 
 The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . 
 The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . 
 You are already pre-qualified for your loan , so you are in good shape . 
 No problem . We can do it right now . 
 All right . Now what do I do ? 
 Which way do you want me to go ? 
 How far do you want me to go ? 
 Just make sure to tell me beforehand . 
 Well , that was fun . Let's do it again soon . 
 Yes , I'm rather good at driving . 
 Yes , but do you have your learner's permit ? 
 Have you ever driven a car before ? 
 Are you aware of all the controls in the car ? 
 When would you like me to start teaching you ? 
 Call me tomorrow , and we'll get started . 
 Did you bring your ticket ? 
 Did you bring your ID ? 
 You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket . 
 We have to know that this ticket is really yours . 
 Next time you come back , bring your ID . 
 Yes , everything will be cleared . 
 I am not sleepy . 
 There is no way that I can fall asleep right now . 
 It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired . 
 What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ? 
 I'm going to get to sleep eventually . 
 Good night . 
 My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late . 
 Of course not . I really did lose track of time . 
 Yeah , you did . I just forgot to call . 
 That's true . My bad for not calling . 
 You're going to kick me out over this ? 
 Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules . 
 Yes , do you have a wine list ? 
 Do you have mixed drinks in this restaurant ? 
 I am not sure what I want . Do you have any house specials ? 
 That sounds good ! Please bring me one of those . 
 I would like it blended . 
 I would like my margarita with no salt , thank you . 
 What's the problem ? 
 You need change . 
 Yes . It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer . 
 You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on . 
 There's nothing else to it . 
 You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else . 
 A double cheeseburger sounds good . 
 Yes , please . 
 I would love large curly fries . 
 Yes , let me have a medium Pepsi . 
 Yeah , that's it . Thank you . 
 Here you go . Thank you very much . 
 My fault . I didn't realize what time it was . 
 Not really . I'm telling the truth . 
 This is true , but it must've slipped my mind . 
 I know . I should've called . 
 You want to throw me out over this ? 
 That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter . 
 You have to make an appointment before we can come out and install it . 
 What day are you available ? 
 Three o'clock is the only time we can come in . 
 I'm sorry , but that's our only available time . 
 We're completely open on Saturday . 
 That'll be fine . 
 Where is your wine list ? 
 Do you have any mixed drinks available here ? 
 I heard that you are famous for your drinks . What are your specials ? 
 I would love a margarita right now ! That is what I am going to order . 
 I prefer my margarita on the rocks , please . 
 No salt , please . 
 Whatever meal that you plan on making . 
 I do all the cooking . 
 Save it . If you want something to eat , then make it yourself . 
 I had a long day today . I really am not in the mood to make anything . 
 Thanks . I'm going to go take a nap . 
 Thank you . 
 You tell me . 
 You never cook . I always do . 
 Oh please , you need to cook tonight . 
 It was a hard day . Can you just do this for me tonight ? 
 I'm going to go rest for a little bit . 
 Thanks . 
 I don't have any money to buy you a burrito . 
 Look , I only have money to buy myself a burrito . 
 If you're so hungry , why don't you ask someone else for money ? 
 Well , I guess on Friday , then you can eat . 
 Why don't you just go home and eat ? 
 Well , I guess you're out of luck . 
 So am I . 
 How about we go eat in the cafeteria ? 
 You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff . 
 They sell everything . 
 I've gotten chow mein from there before . 
 Trust me , the food isn't half bad . 
 Sure , I can go to the store for you . What do you need ? 
 Is there anything else that you want me to pick up ? 
 Is there any other place you would like me to go to for you ? 
 Sure , no problem . Is your prescription ready ? 
 Okay , I'll pick it up for you . 
 You're welcome . 
 I'm a little short . I don't have enough for you . 
 I really don't have enough money . 
 Well , why don't you ask Bob for some money ? I'm hungry too . 
 Okay , so on Friday , you can buy yourself something to eat . 
 You can always go home and make something to eat . 
 Sorry . That's not my fault . 
 Yeah . I am too . 
 I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria . 
 I actually like the food there . 
 They have anything you want . 
 I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great . 
 I think you'll really like the food there . 
 Let's go get something to eat . 
 We can always go to the cafeteria and eat . 
 The food there is pretty good . 
 You can get whatever you want at the cafeteria . 
 They have really good chow mein . 
 It'll be fine . 
 What do you have in mind ? 
 What kind are you thinking of getting ? 
 What kind of pie do you want ? 
 Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ? 
 I love apple pie . 
 There you go . Problem solved . 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 I'm probably going to buy something too . 
 I want some sort of candy . 
 I want some chocolate . 
 I'm going to get a Snickers or a Kit Kat . 
 I'll just get a Snickers then . 
 What are you thinking of getting ? 
 I think I may get something too . 
 I have a sweet tooth . I want candy . 
 I really want some chocolate . 
 I either want a Snickers or a Kit Kat . 
 Then I guess I'll just get a Snickers . 
 I haven't shopped there . How is the food ? 
 I go to Sons for my groceries . 
 Is there something wrong with Sons ? 
 Do they offer organic foods at Whole Foods ? 
 Maybe I'll try that store out . 
 You're making me a believer . 
 Nope . How's the food there ? 
 I do my shopping at Sons . 
 What's wrong with Sons ? 
 Whole Foods has a lot of organic foods ? 
 I've never been , but I may start shopping there . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 I usually just have a bowl of cereal . 
 Yeah , but I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast . 
 What do you make ? 
 That sounds pretty good . 
 That is a very quick meal to make . 
 Oatmeal and toast sounds good to me . 
 All I usually have is some cereal for breakfast . 
 I sometimes run late in the morning , and can't make breakfast . 
 Tell me what you eat in the morning . 
 That sounds like a great breakfast . 
 That sounds like a very quick meal . 
 I think I'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast . 
 What are you thinking of making ? 
 How about making a teriyaki bowl ? 
 All it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice . 
 All you have to do is cook some white rice . 
 Then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce . 
 All that's left is to cook it . 
 What are you going to cook ? 
 A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . 
 All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef . 
 The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . 
 Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it . 
 Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy . 
 I changed my diet recently , and I eat a lot healthier now . 
 My diet consists mainly of fruits , veggies , and chicken . 
 Just about . 
 You know that fruits and vegetables are very healthy foods ? 
 I bake chicken because it's a healthy way to eat it . 
 You should try it . You won't be disappointed . 
 No , I haven't . Is the food good there ? 
 I usually shop at Sons . 
 What's the problem with Sons ? 
 Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods ? 
 I haven't been shopping there , but maybe I'll try it sometime . 
 I'll take your word for it . 
 I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself . 
 I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken . 
 That's basically what I eat . 
 Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . 
 It's really healthy to eat when you bake it . 

I really need to start eating healthier . 
 What kind of food do you usually eat ? 
 Is that really all that you eat ? 
 How do you stick to only those foods ? 
 Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ? 
 That does sound pretty good . 

What are you going to have for breakfast ? 
 You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast . 
 It's easy to make a quick breakfast . 
 When I need to make a quick breakfast , I just make some oatmeal , toast , and OJ . 
 It's not time consuming at all . 
 Would you like me to make something ? 

What are we eating for lunch ? 
 I kind of want pizza . 
 So , what do you feel like eating then ? 
 I already had a burger yesterday . 
 We can just each get what we want to get . 
 Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 

Do you know what you want to eat for lunch ? 
 I want to get some pizza . 
 Tell me what you want to eat . 
 See , I had a burger for lunch yesterday . 
 How about I get pizza and you get a burger ? 
 Where do they sell both at ? 

What's for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm not making anything . 
 What am I supposed to cook ? 
 I want some chicken and potatoes . 
 When are you going to make it ? 
 Fine , I'll make it . 

I am starving . 
 I'm still hungry . 
 I just need a snack . 
 I don't have the slightest clue . 
 I'm not sure what kind I want . 
 I think I will do that . 

I'm hungry . 
 It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again . 
 I'm going to get a snack . 
 I don't know . 
 I don't know what kind of sandwich I want . 
 I may just do that . 

I have a sweet tooth . 
 I would love to get some dessert . 
 I'd love to get a pie . 
 I'm not sure . 
 What kind do you like ? 
 I love apple pie too . 

I have a taste for something sweet . 
 I want some kind of dessert . 
 I was thinking about ordering some kind of pie . 
 I honestly don't know . 
 What's your favorite kind ? 
 That sounds really good to me right now . 

Hi , What's for lunch ? 
 I was thinking of pizza . 
 Well , what do you want to eat ? 
 I ate a burger just the other day . 
 You could always get a burger , and I can get a pizza . 
 Where can we go to get both ? 

What's the side dish that you're making for dinner ? 
 What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ? 
 Why don't you make some corn ? 
 I don't understand what you mean . 
 Why don't you grill it ? 
 Yeah , that sounds delicious . 

Welcome , what would you like to order ? 
 Would you like everything on it ? 
 Do you want any fries ? 
 Can I get you anything to drink ? 
 Is that everything ? 
 You're welcome , and your total is $ 5.48 . 

What do you plan on making as a side dish for dinner ? 
 Do you know what kind ? 
 I wouldn't mind eating some corn . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You should throw some corn on the grill . 
 That sounds good . 

I need to eat something . 
 I know , but I'm hungry again . 
 I think I'm going to go make myself a snack . 
 I'm not exactly sure . 
 I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make . 
 I'm going to do that . 

I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me . 
 Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get . 
 I don't think I forgot anything . 
 If you don't mind , I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription . 
 Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready . 
 Thank you . 

Hi , what can I get for you ? 
 With everything on it ? 
 Did you want fries with your order ? 
 Did you want something to drink ? 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 No problem , that'll be $ 5.48 . 

Hello , I am calling about my cable service . 
 For the past week my cable hasn't been working . 
 Do you know when it is going to start working again ? 
 Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working ? 
 So I don't have to pay anything ? 
 Okay , thank you very much for your help . 

Can you pick up some things from the store for me ? 
 I need a few things , I'll give you the list .

 So , I don't have to pay for it ? 
 Okay , thanks for everything . 

I have a question about my cable . 
 I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week . 
 Could you tell me when it will be back on ? 
 In the meantime , do I still have to pay for the cable ? 
 Does that mean I won't have to pay for it ? 
 Thanks , I appreciate your help .

My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . 
 Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? 
 There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . 
 You know , that is one of my favorites ! 
 You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .

 Our most popular drinks are our Cuervo Gold margaritas . 
 Can I bring that to you on the rocks , or would you like it blended ? 
 Salt or no salt ? 

What are we going to eat for dinner ? 
 I didn't plan on cooking tonight . 
 I don't know what to make . 
 I've been craving chicken and potatoes . 
 Are you going to cook it tonight ? 
 Okay , I guess I'll cook . 

Are we going to have dinner tonight ? 
 I'm not cooking dinner . 
 I'm not sure what to cook for dinner . 
 I have a taste for some chicken and potatoes . 
 So are you planning on cooking it ? 
 I'll cook dinner . 

I'm so thirsty . 
 That's a good idea . 
 I kind of want a soda . 
 What do you mean ? 
 What are you supposed to drink ? 
 I guess I will get water . 

What are you going to eat with your sandwich ? 
 What kind do you like ? 
 What kind of apples do you like ?

 Green apples are too sour for me .

 That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time , right ? 

It's time for you to wake up . 
 I'm sorry , but it's time for you to get ready for school . 
 You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep .

 No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . 

Shouldn't you already be in bed ? 
 You need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning . 
 Just close your eyes , and try not to think . 
 It doesn't matter , you need to get some sleep . 
 Then you're not going to go to sleep . 
 I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams .

 It doesn't matter , because you damaged my car .

You ran into my car . 
 You messed up my car . 
 My rear bumper is messed up . 
 It's smashed in . 
 The same thing is wrong with your bumper .

 I have no choice . 

Have you been coming to this Laundromat long ? 
 Why is that ?

Hello , I'm returning your phone call . 
 No problem , but what were you calling about ? 
 Is he messing up in school ? 
 What was he doing ? 
 I don't know what's gotten into him . 
 I will get right on that , and I am very sorry . 

I have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house . 
 I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more . 
 I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer . 
 Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ? 
 Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ? 

Did you call me ? 
 What was your call about ? 
 What did he do ? 
 Exactly what did he do ? 
 I don't know what his problem is . 
 That won't happen again , I'm sorry . 

Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet ? 
 Should I accept their offer ? 
 What if I make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? 
 I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . 
 How long before I find out what their decision is ? 

I believe that you called me ? 
 Why did you call me ? 
 Did he do something wrong ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's really not like him . 
 I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again . 

Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ? 
 That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do . 
 If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ? 
 Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer . 
 Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ? 

Why'd you run into me ? 
 You have completely damaged my car . 
 You don't see what happened to my bumper ? 
 You smashed my bumper in with your car . 
 Your bumper looks exactly the same . 
 Give me your information , in case I don't hear from you . 

I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . 
 Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ? 
 Is a home inspection very expensive ? 
 Do I get to choose who inspects the home ?

I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front . 
 Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list . 
 I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here . 
 I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day . 
 Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ? 

May I help you ? 
 Ask away . 
 Why do you need to take the course ? 
 You have to do six hours behind the wheel . 
 You can't finish in less than three days . 
 There's nothing else to it . 

What do you need today ? 
 What kind of classes would you like to take ? 
 Okay , you're going to need to make an appointment . 
 You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork . 
 Sure you can ; when would you like to come in ? 
 That'll be fine . 

Hey , let ’ s pull over and look at that house over there . 
 Yes , it is on our list . 
 Let ’ s sign the registry . The realtor looks kind of busy right now . 
 Oh look , they have some refreshments in here . 
 Does it say how much they are asking for this house ? 

From the looks of this house from the outside , I don ’ t really think that I want to go inside . 
 I am not impressed by the interior of this house . 
 With so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ? 
 Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ? 
 Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ? 

Were you able to contact the owners about my counter-offer ? 
 I hope that they accepted the counter-offer . 
 Will the home inspection cost me a lot ? 
 Is it my choice as to who inspects this house ? 
 How long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ? 

I see an Open House sign over there , and I think we should go check it out . 
 Yes , I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet . 
 We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here . 
 On such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers . 
 What is the price of this house in the flyer ? 

What can I do for you today ? 
 What do you need to know ? 
 It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course . 
 You're going to need to complete six hours . 
 You can do two hours a day for three days . 
 Yes , that's all you need to do . 

Did you take the written test ? 
 Make sure to study first . 
 I'm sure you're ready . 
 No , it doesn't cost anything . 
 It skips around . 
 I thought it would be easy , but I didn't pass it . 

About my driving test , did I do well ? 
 Are you telling me that I passed the test ? 
 What did I mess up on ?

Did I do well on my driving test ? 
 So , I passed ? 
 Did I mess up on anything ? 
 What was that ? 
 Yeah , that's pretty hard for me . 
 I know , but I still get my license , right ?

 Keep going until I tell you to stop . 
 That's all for today , so park right there . 

So , you know how to drive , right ? 
 Do you think you can teach me ? 
 I have it already . 
 I've only done it once . 
 Yes , I am aware of them . 
 Whenever you have time . 

Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers . 
 Do you need anything from me ? 
 There are a lot of papers ! 
 My dad is going to be here in a minute to help me go through this with you . 
 Can I start moving in after I finish signing these documents ? 

I am here to sign my escrow papers . 
 Should I have brought anything with me ? 
 Where do I start ? 
 Can I make a phone call to a friend if I have a question ? 
 Will the house be mine when we finish these documents ? 

I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers . 
 What should I have brought with me ? 
 I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers . 
 My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question . 
 Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine ? 

Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer ? 
 Did they accept the counter-offer ? 
 How much will that cost ? 
 Can I choose the home inspector ? 
 So , when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance ? 

Have you taken the written test yet ? 
 You should study before you take it . 
 Why don't you take the test ? 
 Since you already paid for your permit , you don't have to pay again . 
 No , the test skips a lot of things in the book . 
 No , I didn't , because it was pretty hard . 

I have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer . 
 I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
 We could try that , but I really want this house ! 
 How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer ? 
 Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer ? 

Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house . 
 I think that maybe I should accept their offer . 
 I want to make another offer , but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house . 
 I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . 
 Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ? 

How can I get my driver's license ? 
 I have yet to take my driving test . 
 When can I take my test ? 
 I would like to make one right now . 
 That would be great . 
 If I could do it in the morning , then that would be good .

 I don't understand how I could've failed it . 
 What are the reasons ? 
 Can I take the test again ?

 What did I do wrong ? 
 Thanks.Will I be able to take a retest ? 

Do you know how to drive ?

 I'm sure you didn't . 
 Don't mention it . 

I want to get on the bus already . 
 It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago . 
 I need to get to work , so it better . 
 I agree , it's just never on time . 
 I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather . 
 We need to get a car . 

I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . 
 How much are the roses ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I'll take a dozen . 
 No , the roses will be fine . 

Hello . I want to purchase an old music box . 
 I was hoping I could find something made in the ' 20s . 
 I hope at least one of them has dancing figures . 
 So hard to choose . I think I'll take this one . 
 Does a warranty come with this music box ? 
 I just thought I would ask . 

You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? 
 Who won ? 
 What was the score ? 

I ’ m going to be moving out soon . 
 There ’ s no way that I can stay here . 
 I don ’ t understand why . 
 Why can ’ t I have it back ? 
 You have to give it back to me . 
 But I ’ m not able to live here anymore . 

Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ? 
 That sounds good . Let me see one . 
 Oh , she's nice . How much is she ? 
 Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it . 
 No , thank you . 
 Oh , cash will be fine . 

I ’ m moving out . 
 I won ’ t be able to stay here anymore . 
 I don ’ t know why there ’ s a problem . 
 Why can ’ t you give it back to me ? 
 I ’ m going to need my deposit back . 
 I can ’ t stay here , though . 

I opened my mail , found this eviction notice , and don ’ t know what to do with it . 
 Just for being a few days late ? 
 Are you taking my apartment away ? 
 Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full ? 
 I will go write a check right now . 

I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you . 
 I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions . 
 We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home . 
 It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children . 
 In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake . 

What is this eviction notice for ? 
 Are you kidding me ? 
 You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! 
 Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ? 
 I am going to take care of the rent payment right now . 

I received an eviction notice from you , and I don ’ t understand what it means . 
 You can ’ t make me move just for being late with my rent . 
 Are you throwing me out ? 
 If I catch up on my rent , can I stay ? 
 I will go get the money right now . 

I have to move . 
 I can ’ t stay here anymore . 
 What is the problem ? 
 Why not ? 
 But I need it back . 
 It will be impossible for me to stay here . 

I need to see if I qualify for a home loan . 
 I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year . 
 I have only worked at this job for 6 months , but I have a longer job history elsewhere . 
 No , I only receive my salary . 
 I think that it is around 600 . 

I have a good feeling about this house . 
 I love the paint job ! 
 What a beautiful home ! 
 I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street . 
 I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen . 
 I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering ! 

I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you . 
 It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon . 
 Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend . 
 If you could pick me up at home , that would be great . 
 That might be a little too much , but we ’ ll see how it goes . 

I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy . 
 My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year . 
 I have been at my current job for 10 years . 
 I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property . 
 I try not to think about it ! 

I want to go house shopping , and I want to know what I can afford to buy . 
 I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . 
 I have been at the job I now have for 2 years , and I have been with the company for 6 years total . 
 I own a small rental unit with a partner , and I receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit . 
 I don ’ t know , but the last time I checked , it was very good ! 

Hello , I would like to make an appointment to look at houses . 
 I would prefer mornings . 
 Going to look at houses during the week is best for me . 
 I will meet you at the real estate office . 
 That sounds good to me . 

I really like the way this house looks . 
 The landscaping is wonderful ! 
 Oh , I see what you mean ! 
 I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls . 
 Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink ! 
 I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom . 

Can we choose a time to look at houses together ? 
 Either way is good for me . 
 I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . 
 I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . 
 I would like to see as many as possible . 

This looks like a very nice house . 
 The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! 
 This home is gorgeous on the inside ! 
 The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . 
 I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . 
 There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . 

Does it look too big ? 
 Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it . 
 Here's my credit card . 
 Yes . Here you are . 

Does it look too small ? 
 I agree . I'm going to buy it . 
 I'll charge it . 
 There you go . 

Well , how does it look ? 
 Let me pay for it now . 
 I think I'll use my credit card . 
 Here's my John Hancock . 

I've brought this dress back to exchange it . 
 I was hoping you'd have something on sale today . 
 Is the sale going to include dresses ? 
 I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend . 

What do you think ? 
 I would like to purchase it . 
 Here , take my credit card . 
 Sure . Here you go . 

Does it look like a good fit ? 
 Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it . 
 Let me use my credit card . 
 No problem .

 A pipe in my apartment is leaking . 
 The pipe is in my bathroom . 
 The pipe has been leaking for a couple days . 
 Yes , I ’ m aware of that . 
 I just need the problem fixed . 

I ’ m glad you could make it . 
 I think a pipe burst in my apartment . 
 You ’ ll find the pipe in my bathroom . 
 It ’ s been leaking for a couple of days now . 
 I understand . 
 I just want the problem taken care of . 

What do you think of the test ? 
 It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ? 
 Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . 
 No , I wouldn't worry about you . 
 It seems to me that you always do better than you say . 
 Well , I think you'll like the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it . 
 No . You would break all your teeth on it . 
 The sale price today is $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside . 
 They come from tropical countries . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it . 
 No . Peel the skin with a sharp knife , and throw out the seed . 
 Well , they're on sale today for only $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 You can buy them either ripe or unripe . Unripe ones are hard . 
 The ones that are on sale are from Central America . 
 What would make this apartment better for you ? 
 You can have a different carpet , but you have to pay more if it costs more . 
 It could vary quite a bit , between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard . 
 I have to see a sample . Bring me one this week , please . 
 Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week . 
 You ’ re welcome . What ’ s the problem ? 
 Where exactly is the pipe ? 
 How long has the pipe been leaking ? 
 I must tell you that in order to get to the pipe , I must tear down that wall . 
 That won ’ t be a problem ? 
 All right , I will start working now . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 I don ’ t have much contact with them . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ’ m too afraid of making mistakes in English . I don ’ t want to be laughed at . 
 Thanks for the advice . I guess you ’ re right . It ’ s just hard to overcome my shyness . I really will try from now on . I promise . 
 Yes , I am . I really don ’ t know anyone . 
 No . I was here last semester , but I didn ’ t find out about this class in time . So I ’ m taking it this semester . 
 How is it ? Did you learn anything here ? Why are you taking it again ? 
 That ’ s just what I need . Thanks so much . You ’ Ve been a big help already . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you get enough sleep last night ? 
 Are you worried about something ? Why couldn ’ t you sleep ? 
 Well , take it easy . Things will look better tomorrow . Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax . 

Do you mind if I ask you a question ? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it . 
 Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ? 
 I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own . 
 Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return . 

I was wondering if you could help me with something . 
 Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly . 
 What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? 
 Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . 
 Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon . 
 You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! 

Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing . 
 Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps . 
 More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . 

Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ? 
 Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ? 
 That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you . 
 Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick . 
 Good idea . I think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance .

 Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? 
 Does this one look big enough ? 
 Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? 
 Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . 
 We have a great selection . What decade are you looking for ? 
 We have six . 
 Actually , two of them have dancing figures . 
 A good choice . I prefer that one myself . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything .

 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan . 
 You might want to try the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . 
 Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . 
 Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . 
 Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet . 
 Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat .

 I'm sorry , but you just have to take your chances . 
 Even if it doesn't work , it's a beautiful collectible . 
 Exactly how old a box do you want ? 
 We still have six left .

 Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one . 
 No . But if something goes wrong with it , I know someone who repairs these things .

 What do you need to buy ? 
 Where are you going to go look for one ? 
 You don't know where you want to look for one ? 
 Do you want to know where I got mine from ? 
 I purchased mine from IKEA . 
 Not at all , but you get what you pay for . 
 What are you going to look for ? 
 What store are you going to ? 
 You don't know ? 
 Would you like me to tell you where I got mine . 
 I went to get mine from IKEA . 
 They're not cheap , but neither is their furniture . 
 What are you unhappy with ? 
 If you agree to pay more money , you could upgrade the carpet . 
 It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard . 
 Bring me a paint sample to look at , and I will consider it . 
 Your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next Tuesday . 
 Oh yeah ? What do you need to go shopping for ? 
 Do you know where you're going to find your bedroom set ? 
 There's no particular place that you want to look at ? 
 I can tell you where I got mine , if you'd like . 
 I bought mine from IKEA . 
 Not really , but you're paying for quality . 
 I can help you . What location are you looking for ? 
 Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size ? 
 Is living in a particular school district important to you ? 
 Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ? 
 Now that I have an idea of what you want , I can begin my search . 
 What is it ? 
 Is the water causing any damage ? 
 I won ’ t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow . 
 I ’ ll do it for you . 
 That ’ s true . 
 I ’ m all right with that . 
 Yes , of course . What area are you interested in ? 
 What size house would you like ? 
 Are you interested in being in a particular school district ? 
 Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ? 
 Fine , I will begin a search for the perfect home for you . I will call you in a few days . 
 What would you like to change ? 
 I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference . 
 It would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard . 
 I would be willing to look at a different color . You need to bring me a sample . 
 You can have the new carpet and paint by next Monday . 
 Are you having problems ? This is the first I ’ Ve heard of it . 
 What kind of problems are you talking about ? 
 Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks . I am leaving on vacation this afternoon . 
 Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! 
 I ’ ll be right over ! 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 Is there any water damage ? 
 I ’ ll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe . 
 I ’ ll just do it myself . 
 You ’ re right about that . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Is the pipe causing any water damage ? 
 I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow . 
 I don ’ t think that would be a good idea . 
 I guess you have a point . 
 Go right ahead . 
 I am kind of busy right now , but maybe later next week I could stop by . 
 What problems did you find ? 
 I don ’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility . You can fix those things yourself . 
 I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! 
 You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! 
 It should take us all the way up to Altadena . 
 I'm not positive if it does or not . 
 I have never been on this bus , but I'm sure it's the right one . 
 I know , and we've been on the bus forever . 
 Oh my gosh , that one says Temple City . 
 Well , now I know the bus that'll take us back . 
 I like the apartment , but I see something wrong with it . 
 There ’ s a leaking faucet in the sink . 
 That leak is going to raise my water bill . 
 You need to fix it . 
 I won ’ t rent it if the faucet isn ’ t fixed . 
 I ’ m glad you finally agree . 
 I see a problem . 
 I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking . 
 It ’ s going to be a problem when my water bill comes . 
 I would like you to fix the problem . 
 Well , I won ’ t be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed . 
 I ’ m happy that we ’ Ve come to an agreement . 
 That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ? 
 Where do you think you have problems ? 
 You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before . 
 I will fix these problems when I get around to it . 
 You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal ! 
 It should go to Altadena . 
 I'm not completely sure if it really does . 
 I'm almost positive that this is the right one . 
 We have been riding this bus for a long time . 
 I think it says Temple City . 
 I'm sorry . But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started . 

Hey , how's it going ? 
 Not bad , thanks for asking . 
 Only about fifteen minutes . 
 Not really , I usually drive . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Once our President lowers gas prices , I'll be driving again . 

Where do we get off at ? 
 This bus ride is taking forever . 
 Did we miss our stop ? 
 Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 I can't catch the bus with you anymore . 

When do we get off the bus ? 
 I feel like we've been on this bus forever . 
 Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already ? 
 I thought you knew where we get off at . 
 Seriously ? 
 That's the last time I get on a bus with you . 

Are you sure that this bus will take us to Santa Anita mall ? 
 You know that for a fact ? 
 Is it a very long bus ride ? 
 Do you know where we get off at ? 
 Really , there's a bus stop right by the mall ? 
 That's convenient . 

Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ? 
 My house is up in Altadena . 
 It'll really take me to the station ? 
 Do you know what street it goes on ? 
 I would've never known . 
 I appreciate you telling me . 

This bus goes all the way to Santa Anita mall , right ? 
 Are you positive ? 
 How long is this bus ride ? 
 Where do we get off at ? 
 There's a stop right next to the mall ? 
 That's cool . 

Do you know which stop we get off at ? 
 We've been on this bus for a while now . 
 Should we have gotten off the bus already ? 
 I thought you knew . 
 Really ? 
 I'm never catching the bus with you again . 

Does this bus really go to the mall ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 How long does it take for the bus to get there ? 
 Where do we get off the bus ? 
 The stop is really at the mall ? 
 That's perfect . 

Do you need help with something ? 
 Do you see anything that you like ? 
 That is a wonderful choice . 
 It's very inexpensive , and it has all the appliances . 
 The fridge and freezer is very spacious , and it also has an ice maker and water dispenser . 
 Take a look inside . 

I'm searching for an old music box . 
 If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . 
 Would any of them have dancing figures ? 
 Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . 
 One last question 
 I guess I was asking for too much . 

Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest . 

I need to get some business cards printed up . 
 I think I can get by with 2,000 . 
 I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards . 
 ... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card . 
 Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven . 

I need to purchase some business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be fine . 
 I want the new cards to be exactly like this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm done . Here's the form and my old card . 
 You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days . 

What can I do for you today ? 
 Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?

The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .

 Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .

Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today ! 
 Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books . 
 Have you forgotten the cheers ?

 I guess English has fewer characters .

 Do you have any advice ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I will think over your advice . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 I take architecture as my major . 
 I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . 
 What ? 
 Mr . Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you . 
 Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow . 
 No . You have to buy your own . You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up . 
 Do we have to type out our homework ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 We are allowed to use a calculator in class ? 

Hey , Brad . How was your day ? 
 I'm going home . 
 Is that right ? 
 So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon . 

Ms . : Do you have a question , Mary ? 
 Ms . : Let me give you a hall pass for it . 
 Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time . 
 Ms . : If a teacher stops you in the hallway , just show him or her the pass . 
 Ms . : That's right . 
 Yes . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? 
 That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . 
 He's going to make the opening speech . 
 What's your excuse this time ? 
 Yes , twice last week . 
 I don't think so . But it could've been . 
 I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? 
 Just try to be a little more punctual in the future . 

Mike , I can't catch up with our Chinese teacher very well . 
 What is that ? 
 Will they recommend me the class that suits me ? 
 That's great . I'll tell my mother about it . 
 Hi . You look excited . What's happening ? 
 And you're planning to enter ? 
 Is there a prize ? 
 Do you think you have a chance ? 
 But you haven't practised all that much . 
 Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help . 

Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? 
 Why ? We can leave school earlier that day . 
 I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . 
 You can ask the teacher for help . 

Excuse me ? I didn't hear what you said . 
 I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ? 
 I'm looking for information on tropical fish . 
 Great , thank you . 

Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ? 
 What happened ? 
 What on earth are you talking about ? 
 What were you thinking ? 
 But what you should do is study hard . 
 So long as you learn from your mistakes . 
 Yes . 
 It'll start on lst September . 
 English is my favorite . 
 Thank you . 
 I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! 
 Cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . 
 No . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . 
 You could try . It would save you a lot of money . 
 If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! 
 Let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . 

Oh , Linda . You must be so excited about going to study in America .

Hi ! How are you doing ? 
 Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ? 
 Oh , I am looking for an apartment . I prefer living off campus . I can study better . 
 Okay , see you around . 

Mary , there's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave . 
 You have to take the math and English evaluation tests . 
 Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills . 
 You are a smart girl ! 

Mr . : Hello , Mary . 
 Mr . : I'm Mr . Taylor , and I'm your counselor . I'm going to show you around the school . 
 Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria . 
 Mr . : But not big enough . And here is our computer room . 
 Mr . : And over here is our gymnasium . 
 Mr . : Just like everyone else . 
 Yeah . Look , other kids are coming this way . 
 That's because regular buses don't stop here .

 But I have to go to my homeroom . 
 No . 
 Stop worrying , Mary . You'll do just fine . 
 You look lost . Can I help you ? 
 Yeah . I'm Brad . 
 What room is it ? 
 It's on the first floor by the nurse's office . 

Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ? 
 Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all . 
 Mr . : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves . Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage . 
 Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition . 
 Mr . : Yes ? 
 Mr . : Would you like to go to the nurse's ? 
 Mr . : Here's a hall pass for it . Do you need someone to walk you there ? 
 Mr . : I'll drop by later to check on you . 
 Certainly.Here ’ s an application form.Do you have proof of residence ? 
 A driver ’ s license or something showing that you live in this city . 
 Do you have a current electricity or gas bill in your name ? 
 That ’ ll do.Bring the most recent one in with your completed application , and we ’ ll issue you a temporary library card right away . 
 It ’ ll be mailed to you within two weeks , but you can borrow books on the temporary card .

 I see . Which subject did you put last then ? 
 That's interesting . Could you give any reasons for your choice ? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first ? 
 Yes . I suppose so . 
 Fine , thanks . How are you ? 
 Oh my lord . I haven't really started them . 
 I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . 
 To be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper . Say ! Why don ’ t you talk to your advisor ? And let me know ! 

Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? 
 Oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? 
 Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! 
 That ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? 
 You mean you got working experience , right ? 
 It must be very demanding . 
 Really ? It sounds interesting . 
 Great . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? 

Our philosophy teacher is very humorous . 
 No , not at all.The examples he gives are very interesting .

 How can we help him ? 

Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ? 
 Really ! 
 How do you feel about that ?

 How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ? 

Hi ! I'm Hong lei . What's your name ? 
 Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ? 
 No , I've been here for six months . 
 It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ?

 How long will you stay with the host family ?

I am looking for some information about home stay . 
 How did you pay them ? 

Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? 
 Does that mean studying all the time ? 
 Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . 
 Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . 
 You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . 
 Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . 
 Why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . 
 I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . 
 I have no idea . 
 Well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . 
 My IQ score is slightly above average . 
 Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . 
 You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . 
 Let's go ! 
 Really ? 
 You're right . 
 Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . 

How did you do in the last quiz ? 
 Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . 
 I hope you'll do better in the final .

Are you ready ? 
 Who can tell us something about the author's life ? Volunteer ? 
 Very good . Sit down , please . Susan , what's the general idea of the text ?

 Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . 
 Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done . 
 Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me .

 Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers . 
 That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? 
 Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye ! 

What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . 
 Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . 
 I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . 

Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University ! 
 How about you ? Have you got any news from university ? 
 I am glad you can study something you really like ! 
 Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . 
 You sure have a lot of discs here . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? 
 Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? 
 I haven't made up my mind . Maybe I will go to the US . What about you ? 
 I think so . 
 That's great . I will go hiking with you . 
 I'd like to speak to the Ms . Collins , please . 
 This is Nathaniel Brown . 
 I'd like to talk to her about my accommodation situation . 
 Ok . 
 Sure . Can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ? 
 It's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8 . 
 No , there's no double six at the end of the number . It's just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight . 
 Anytime before 6 pm tonight . 
 Thank you ! 
 bye ! 
 Canada is north of here . 
 Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States . 
 Mexico is south of the United States . 
 Connecticut is east of New York . 
 Ohio . 
 Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco . 
 Boston is in the northeast part of the country . 
 Las Vegas is in the southwest . 
 Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . 
 The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . 
 She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
 She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? 
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? 
 Ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then . See you then . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yes , sometimes . 
 Yes , they are all on the shelf . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Oh , yes , I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people . And making new friends . 
 Well , there's one thing . 
 I'm a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement I have to do some cooking for them . 
 You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . 
 That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . 
 If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing . 
 From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . 
 But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? 
 How often do you meet ? 
 What days , do you know ? 
 Okay , count me in . 
 It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today . 
 I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . 
 I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . 
 One time I tried just listening , no notes , no pictures . I think I really learned more that day . 
 Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday ! 
 Why did you put it off until the last minute ? 
 Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester . 
 I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself . 
 Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? 
 And you think I fit the qualifications ? 
 Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? 
 I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . 
 No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ? 
 I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ? 
 What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ? 
 I can't agree more . 
 After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . 
 It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side . 
 I guess we should start with nominees first . 
 We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . 
 Yes , I can do that this afternoon . 
 Yes , let me put it on the calendar . 
 Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? 
 You want to be a politician ? Yuck . 
 Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . 
 You're right . We need more people like you in politics . 
 Congratulation . What will you do ? 
 That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do . 
 Good . I'll do it . 
 Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . 
 Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? 
 Oh , no . It's already February 5th . 
 I will think about it . 
 What are those ? 
 Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? 
 I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . 
 I don't know . 
 Yes . 
 It is not true . 
 Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . 
 I will . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . 
 I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester . 
 I am sure we will . 
 You can check out two books at a time . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . 

Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? 
 Did you finish typing it yesterday ? 
 Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? 
 How about the shelf ? 
 Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . 
 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 
 You ’ Ve put it among these journals . 

Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ? 
 Well , you'd better start studying harder if you want to pass this class . 
 What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief . 

I got a ninety-five on my test . 

The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? 
 Are you sure you can do well this year ? 
 According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . 

I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . 

Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? 
 What was the reason ? 

Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . 
 I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . 

Hi ! Ed , what's up ? 
 Doesn't look like it to me . 
 Woo , easy . 
 What are you so ticked off about ? 
 Maybe I can help . 
 You've got to be joking . 
 Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . 
 Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? 
 These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . 
 No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . 
 Well , you can look under the author's name . 
 Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . 
 Really ? Can I join it ? 
 How can I join it ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 This is him speaking . 
 Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . 
 Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? 
 A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . 
 Normally it can be completed in four years . 
 Don't brother me ! 
 Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . 
 I drew a blank on the algebra test . 
 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . 
 I'm thinking of dropping out . 
 I'm dead serious about this , Sally . 

Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? 
 He had moved and held a party on July 1st . 
 Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . 

Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? 
 Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? 
 I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . 

Richard , why didn't you come to school today ? 
 Well , take care of yourself . 
 Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . 

Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! 
 You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . 
 It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . 
 I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . 

Is this the A housing office ? 
 I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full . 
 Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ? 
 Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ? 

It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . 
 Which country do you want to go to ? 
 Were I in your position , I'd go to America . 
 There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . 

Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? 
 Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? 
 The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . 
 Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? 

How many credits are you taking this semester ? 
 What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? 
 If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? 
 Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? 

I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . 
 Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? 
 Why ? 
 What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? 
 Can we get any more help at the International Center ? 
 I see . It must be worth going to . 
 Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . 

What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? 
 You are going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won't you get lonely ? 

What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 

Could you tell me how to use the library ? 
 How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Hi . What's your name ? 
 My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you . 
 No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? 
 Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ? 
 I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . 
 My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . 
 I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . 
 Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . 

Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? 
 What classes do you plan on taking ? 
 Is that class really that popular ? 
 What other classes are you going to take ? 
 I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . 
 I had Professor Mahoney . 
 I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . 
 Not at all . I got a 3.8 . 
 I got a 4.0 in that class . 
 It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . 

Did you get your grades yet ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Ouch . You must be very disappointed . 
 Why don't you re-take the class next year ? 
 I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . 
 What was your GPA before this semester ? 
 Why did it go down so much ? 
 What happened to you ? 
 You better stop slacking off . 

Hi Mark . 
 How was your summer vacation ? 
 I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . 
 Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . 
 She dropped out of school completely . 
 She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . 
 It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . 
 I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . 
 You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . 
 No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . 
 Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . 
 Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . 
 I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . 
 I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . 
 No problem , man . 
 Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? 
 Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . 
 I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . 
 If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . 
 Good luck . 

Can I help you ? 
 These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . 
 I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . 
 All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . 

Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ? 
 It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? 

Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ? 
 How many days do you plan to finish reading it ? 
 OK . After three days , I will come to you for it . 

You'd better prepare for the examination . 
 You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . 

Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? 
 I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . 
 Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . 
 Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . 
 That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . 
 Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . 
 Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . 
 That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . 
 Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . 
 Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . 
 Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . 
 In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . 
 Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . 
 Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . 
 Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . 
 You can ask me any question at any time . 
 They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . 
 I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . 
 I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . 

Did you ever take History 231 ? 
 Who was the professor ? 
 I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? 
 What did you end up getting ? 
 That's probably because he grades on a curve . 
 I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . 
 Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . 
 It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . 
 School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . 
 I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take . 
 That will be great . 
 Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . 
 Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . 

It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . 
 Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . 
 Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? 
 Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? 
 I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . 
 Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . 
 I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? 
 It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . 

It's a sunny day , isn't it ? 
 My name is David . Nice to meet you , too . 
 No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ? 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends . 

Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ? 
 Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? 
 OK . And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ? 
 I see . Thank you very much . 

I think it is time to study . Our chemistry exam is coming . 
 December 1st . 
 It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten . 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 
 I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . Don't lose your heart . 

Good morning , madam . I'd like to apply for a library card . Can you help me ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 OK . Here is the money . And If I return the card , can I get the refund ? 
 OK . I see . Thank you . 

Peter , which club do you want to join ? 
 I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? 
 It's OK . Don't worry about it . Our school coach will train us to play basketball . 
 Have fun . 
 Are you kidding ? 
 Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? 

Welcome to our school . If you need any help , please come to me . 

I failed the exam because I didn't study . 

Peter , have you finished your English composition ? 
 Class starts in twenty minutes . You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today . 
 Do you think you can finish it on time ? 
 You ’ d better hurry ! 
 Sorry ! 
 All right . But how ? 
 I see . But could you give me another piece of paper ? 
 Thank you so much , Mr Addison . 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I've already got your certificate for sick leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class , could you preview it ? 

Would you like to come to our party ? 
 What happened ? You look so pale . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . 
 Don't lose heart . Everything will be fine . 

What's this then ? 
 But this should have been handed in last Thursday . 
 Well , what's your excuse then ? 
 Oh , Yes ? 

Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? 
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 

Good morning . Mrs.Smith . 
 Well , what kind of books does she like ? 
 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
 Do you know if she's read this one ? 
 Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 
 I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting . 

Can I help you ? 
 I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ? 
 There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . 

Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? 
 Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? 
 Got it . 
 No , but my little brother likes it very much . 
 I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . 
 Jane Austen . 
 I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . 
 Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . 
 I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . 
 Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . 
 But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? 
 Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . 
 Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . 
 You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . 
 You can count on me . 
 I'm sorry , I overslept . 
 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . 
 Thanks . 
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? 
 OK . Thank you very much for your trouble . 

It's the 17th week now , isn't it ? 
 Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous . 
 No , I haven't began my preparations . 
 Great . You can help me a lot with English . 
 No problem . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 That's all you need . 
 You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Yes , over there to your left . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ? 
 Good . See you later . 

Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ? 
 Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ? 
 It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ? 
 Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? 
 Three months ? Incredible ! 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 
 Only for this reason ? 
 Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . 

How do I apply to an American university ? 
 I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . 
 What's to come next ? 
 How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 

I am going to give you an end-of-the-unit test this Friday . Please be prepared for it . 
 Review all the lessons in this unit and see if you can understand the main idea of each lesson . 
 Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . You should know how to use them . 
 Certainly . 
 Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching . 
 How about tomorrow ? 

Where are you going ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it . 
 What for ? 
 I really admire you for that . How is it going ? 

What are you going to do for your year abroad , Tim ? 
 You ’ re going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won ’ t you get lonely ? 

I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . 
 I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . 

Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 

What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation ! 
 Why ? 
 Do you think it will help ? 
 Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too . 

Hello . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . 
 That's because it's full . 
 Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? 
 Alright . And what is your major ? 
 Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? 
 Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . 
 The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . 
 That's right . 
 Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . 
 Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . 
 Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . 
 Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things . 
 I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . 
 I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall . 
 No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . 
 No , I thought I would take it later . 
 Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . 
 I can take it then . I have that time slot free . 
 I'll take it then . 
 I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . 
 That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . 
 Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? 
 Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . 
 Sorry , it's tails . You lose . 
 Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? 
 Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . 
 Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? 
 So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . 
 I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . 
 C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . 
 Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ? 
 Alright . See you later . 
 Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . 
 It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . 
 I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . 
 Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . 
 No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . 
 They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . 
 Yes , but I need to write it by next week . 
 I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . 
 First , I need a letter of recommendation . 
 And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . 
 Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . 
 I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning . 
 That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . 

Can I help you ? 
 These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . 
 I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . 
 All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . 

Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? 
 It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . 
 Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . 
 I like it so far . But my English still needs work . 
 Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? 
 I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . 
 Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . 
 You mean you and I ? 
 That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? 
 How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? 
 Would I help you with writing ? 
 I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? 
 Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 
 It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . 
 Let me give you my phone number . 

Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . 
 Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . 
 Yes . 
 What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . 
 I know , but I listened . 
 I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . 
 That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . 
 Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . 
 Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . 
 Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . 
 Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit . 
 What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! 
 Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well . 
 It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk . 
 My permission letter ? 
 I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office . 
 But I asked them to send it to you directly . 
 My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R . 
 Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ? 
 I see . Thank you . 

I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? 
 I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . 
 But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . 
 What ? 
 I already had that idea . 
 But I don't know what I would do . 
 Maybe . I don't know . 
 I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . 
 Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . 
 I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . 
 What about beer ? 
 That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? 
 And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? 
 Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? 
 Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . 
 Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . 
 Thanks . 
 Yeah , I quit . 
 I'm fed up with his boring lectures . 
 Of course not , help yourself . 
 I have a test tomorrow . 
 What ? 
 What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ? 
 What ’ s wrong with speaking English ? 
 What are you doing that for ? 
 Good for you . 
 Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . 
 No , thank you . 
 I wouldn't count on it . 
 Yes , but I'll bet she won't again . 
 No , it's no use . 
 I know . She won't change my grade . 
 Sure , what gives ? 
 On the level ? 
 That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning . 

Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ? 
 What would you like to know ? 
 Yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects . 
 If you give me your address , I can mail you an information packet and the application forms . 

Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . 
 You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . 
 Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? 
 Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . 
 So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . 

What ’ s your schedule like this year ? 
 What ’ s your major ? 
 Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long . 
 When is it due ? 
 Remind me never to sign up for that course ! 
 I ’ m sorry registration has closed . 
 Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? 
 She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ? 
 Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . 
 Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . 
 Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . 
 Don ’ t get your hopes up . 
 I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Excuse me , sir . This air compressor doesn't work . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to introduce myself first . 
 My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . 
 I am , sir . 
 It's me , sir . But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it . 

How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? 
 Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . 
 Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . 
 I am very grateful for your advice . 

What's your schedule like this year ? 
 What's your major ? 
 Oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It's really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long . 
 When is it due ? 
 Remind me never to sign up for that course . 
 Mark , this is Lucy . 
 I have a friend . He is my best friend and he wants to learn English . He would pay about 100 yuan per hour . Are you interested ? 
 So I take it you are not interested . 
 Don't worry . My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule . 
 Let's do it this way . I'll take him to your place this Saturday . Then you two can make a schedule . 
 How are you going to get there ? 
 I am sure my friend can give you a ride . 
 He is a lawyer . 
 See you . 
 Eight altogether . 
 Six are compulsory , two optional . 
 Yes , what's it ? 
 It's miles per hour . 
 It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . 
 No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . 

You'll have to take a make-up exam in logic . 
 Sorry to say you failed . 

Who is it ? 
 Wait a sec . 
 We're watching a football match . What's the matter ? 
 I'm sorry about this . 
 You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore . 
 I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . 
 Yes , I'm serious this time . 
 There's many books here.What about these ? 
 Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . 

I've got to go home and study . 
 The test tomorrow . 

Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yes , sometimes . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . 
 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 
 Which university should I apply to ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you very much . 
 Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . 
 I am 100 % certain . 
 I am sure I can get a 95 this time . 
 Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
 Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
 No . 

Can you help me do an internet search ? 
 I want to find information on World War Two . 
 Yes , I want to know about the Normandy Landing . 
 Oh , wow ! There are lot of sites . 
 Thanks . 
 Thanks . If I am interested , I'll go to the library . 
 I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . 
 I hear we ’ ll have a new English teacher this semester . 
 I am sure we will . 
 Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . 
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 
 Yes , I'd like a book about law . 
 Uh , the Origin of Law . And it's written by Professor Felix of Harvard . 
 Next week ? It is too late . I need it urgently . 
 No , thanks any way . 

Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! 
 Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . 
 Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? 
 That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . 
 That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? 
 I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! 
 Yeah , you too ! 
 What happened ? 
 Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! 
 Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here . 
 Yes I am . You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre , title or if you know the author , I can point you towards the right direction . 
 That would be in our children's section . That book shelf there on the right . 
 Do you have a library card ? 
 I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state . 
 So you are all set . You can have these books for two weeks . If you need to have them longer , you can bring them here to renew them . If you don't , you get charged ten cents a day for each book . 

Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! 
 Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . 
 Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . 

Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . 
 Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . 
 Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . 

How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . 
 Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? 
 Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . 
 We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . 
 That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . 
 A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . 

Hey Eve , how are you ? 
 I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
 Yes . Don ’ t you ? 
 Which class are you working on right now ? 
 Are you in Mrs Green ’ s class ? 
 Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! 
 Sure . This library is too quiet though . 
 That sounds good . 

Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 
 I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? 
 It must be interesting to study English . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 

Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 

Lucy , you ’ re back . How was your first day of school ? 
 What classes did you have ? 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ? 
 Where is she from ? 
 Were you able to understand everything that she said ? 
 She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will . 
 did she give you any homework ? 
 no wonder you like the class so much . 
 That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . 
 She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . 
 She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . 
 If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . 
 She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . 
 Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . 
 Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . 
 As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . 
 Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . 
 ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . 
 You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks'study in the school will have a similar effect on you . 
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 

Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 Yes , I finished last Friday . 
 Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . 
 Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . 
 Oh , yes . 
 Five days a week , too ? 
 Gosh ! 
 Where are you going now ? 
 When do you start school ? 
 That's good . 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States . 
 Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools . 
 Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education . 
 No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city . 
 The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . 

Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? 
 I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . 
 It lasts for 9 months . 
 The next beginning class starts on October 25th . 
 From 7 to 9 o'clock . 
 It costs 125 dollars a month . 
 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . 
 I major in Japanese . 
 Its very helpful . The course has let me into a world of literature . I read so many great literatures . 
 Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... 
 I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . 
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . 
 Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I'd like to take English . 
 Because I want to study english literature . but I think chemistry is better for getting a job . 
 I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist . 
 Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . 
 Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? 
 Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? 
 Very nice . Thank you for your time . 
 OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . 
 OK . But I'd like some cookies . 
 I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . 
 It's OK . Thank you . 
 Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . 
 Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . 
 That's a problem . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 How many credits for each course ? 
 Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . 
 Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! 
 I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again . 
 Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . 
 I guess I never thought of that before . 
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 
 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . 
 It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... 
 Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low . 
 Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . 
 Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before . 
 You ’ re having me on again . 

I wish I had access to the public library . 

I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . 
 I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! 
 Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . 
 You can always take it again . 
 Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . 
 Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . 
 I'm sorry - I still don't understand . 
 So , will I be able to find this book ? 
 Okay . Thank you . I understand now . 
 No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! 
 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
 Thank you for you help . 
 Certainly . Let me see.Oh , it's on that shelf . 
 Of course.Here you are . 

How long can I keep these books ? 
 What if I can't finish them by then ? 
 Any terrible fines ? 

I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course.Do you think it's a good idea 
 Really ? Do you think English is that important ? 
 Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend . 
 No , I left it at home.Sorry ! 
 So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ? 
 No problem . I just got paid.It ' s my treat . 
 Forget it ! That's what friends are for ! Besides , I have a VIP card for a discount . 
 I think so too.Let ' s go ! 
 No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
 What was that like ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did you get any perks on the job ? 

Can I borrow these magazines ? 
 Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? 

Can I help you ? 
 Yes , but it's checked out . 
 It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ? 
 Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book . 
 Take the card , and fill in your name and library card number . 

What can I do for you ? 
 Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ? 
 Oh , maybe you can find something from the New York Times , or the Washington Post during that period . 
 You are welcome . 
 I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? 
 What did you get ? 
 That's not bad . 
 Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? 
 I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? 
 You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . 
 Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . 
 Then go to bed and have a good sleep . 
 Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! 

This is my admission card , and these are the books . 
 By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? 
 Sense and Sensibility , English version . 
 Can I just do it here ? 
 OK , thanks . 
 I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library ... anyway , how much should I pay ? 
 Here you are . Thanks . 

Have we handed out all the water ? 
 Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . 
 Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . 
 Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . 
 On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . 
 The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . 

There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . 
 To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . 
 It might be the English teacher . What about you ? 
 She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . 
 I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . 

I've been so stressed these days . 
 I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . 
 And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . 
 OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? 
 OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . 
 En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . 
 I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . 
 Hi , this is Maria . Is that Shirley ? 
 Shirley , do you know today's homework from our economic law class ? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now . 
 OK . 
 Explain the economic law ? An essay question again ? 
 Are there any clear answers in the book to this question ? 
 OK , thank you , Shirley . You are very helpful . I have another question . When does the Economic Law of China come into effect ? 
 There isn't such a code ? 
 Got it . Thank you , Shirley . 
 Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . 
 That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . 
 Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . 
 Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . 
 But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . 
 Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . 
 I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave . 
 The housework is really a big problem for me . My husband is on a business trip to the U . S . now and I have to take care of everything myself . 
 I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class . 
 Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time . 
 It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on . 
 Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience . 

So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? 
 That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? 
 Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . 
 Oh , God , I've forgotten it . 
 Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . 
 Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? 
 So you just talk all the time ? 
 That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . 

Are you studying here ? 
 What are you major in ? 
 What do you think of the literature course . 

Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 

Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . 
 That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated . 
 No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . 
 How could he make such a silly mistake ? 
 He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? 
 That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . 
 Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... 
 I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . 
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald.this is very nice of you . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages . 

Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . 
 Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . 

Are you studying any languages here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 Do you know anything about Britain and America ? 
 Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 

What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work . 

Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? 
 Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . 
 Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . 

Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 
 I suppose she's right.Does she speak English very slowly ? 
 It must be interesting to study English . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 

Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 

What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 

Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? 
 And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ? 
 Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ? 
 Could I see that , please ? 
 Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is . 
 Yes , it is a three-year , but you can renew the visa each year in the States . It is our usual procedure . 

Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all . His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 

Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 

I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . 
 I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . 

Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? 
 I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . 
 I haven't finished it . It is very difficult . 
 Oh , I know . I will try my best . 

Helen , you must be excited at going to America to study . 
 What do your classmates think of it ? 
 How long will you study there . 
 Which university will you go to ? 
 Good luck ! 

Have you been in America long , Hellen ? 
 Where are you going to study ? 
 What are you going to major in ? 
 For nearly four years . 

Are you studying here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 What do you think of the literature course ? 

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I am applying on it . 
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
 Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . 

What courses are you going to take next year ? 
 Why are you going to take English with chemistry and physics ? 
 Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you decide what you are going to do when you graduated ? 

Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . 
 Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . 

Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? 
 Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . 
 Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . 

Where's Mrs . Johnson ? 
 I see . Can I sit down ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Johnson . 
 Okay , Tom . 
 She's upstairs in my room . 

Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . 
 It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . 
 Yeah . They're usually this big . 
 All the parts work . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Sure . 
 I don't mind helping . 
 So that's four plates , four forks , four knives , and four spoons ? 
 Don't be silly ! I know how to use knives and forks . 
 You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . 
 You're right.If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 OK . 
 How about yourself ? 
 Daniel , I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard . 
 OK , I've finished cleaning the blackboard . 
 Oh , I forgot about it . I'll get it . 
 I will be done before they come . 
 What's your favorite course , Daniel ? 
 Science ? That's a surprise . 
 I thought you would like PE . 
 Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . 
 Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . 
 Hope so . 
 Of course , I'd like to . 
 What is in it ? 
 Do you get along with your roommates ? 
 Which floor are you on ? 
 Oh , you can climb the stairs as a workout . 
 Wow , your roommates are cleaning the room . 

Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well . 
 You are quite good at English , can you help me with it . 
 English school ? What is that ? 
 Is that different from our school's English course ? 

Adam , could you show me around the school ? 
 What's the tallest building ? 
 Yes . 
 What's the building to the south of the library ? 
 Is there a swimming pool in your school ? 
 I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . 

Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? 
 Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . 
 Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . 

Could you please help me to check out the book ? 
 I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ... 
 No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature . 
 Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket . 
 I can't find it now . 
 Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography . 
 Thanks . 
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 
 Of course . Here you are . 

Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 

At what age do children start school in your country ? 
 Do boys and girls go to school together ? 
 Do you think this is a good idea ? 
 Do some children go on to university ? 
 What examinations do they take first ? 
 How long do you usually stay at university ? 

Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Yes.Here ' s my identification . 
 Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? 

Excuse me , Miss . 
 I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . 
 Sure . 3:30 this afternoon . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . 
 Thanks . 
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? 
 OK.Thank you very much for your trouble . 

Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 Yes , I finished last Friday . 
 Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . 
 Yes , I intend to go to university.That ' ll be in September.But it all depends on my A level results . 
 Oh , yes . 
 Five days a week , too ? 
 Gosh ! 
 Where are you going now ? 
 When do you start school ? 
 That's good . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed.He ' s strict with himself , too.We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . 
 Yeah , that's it . 

Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . 
 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 

What's the matter ? You don't look well . 
 What about ? 
 Oh , is that all ? 
 Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
 I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ? 
 we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . 
 unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . 
 as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . 
 my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . 

How are you doing today ? 
 What may I do for you ? 
 What do you need help with ? 
 Have you looked in the periodicals ? 
 I can show you where they are . 
 Follow me , please . 

That looks like an interesting book . 
 There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . 
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 
 TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . 
 What sports do they play there ? 
 Is that building a perfect cube ? 
 Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . 
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 
 There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . 
 Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . 

What can I do for you ? 
 I need your library card . 
 It seems you have late fees . 
 Yes , I ’ m sure . 
 Your late fees come to $ 24.50 . 
 You have to pay it off before you can check out more books . 

How may I help you ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 It appears that you have late fees . 
 Yes , really . 
 You owe $ 24.50 in late fees . 
 I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . 

What do you need ? 
 I ’ m going to need your library card . 
 Why don ’ t you apply for one right now ? 
 Please fill out this application . 
 Now , sign your name on the back of the card . 
 Here ’ s your library card . 

What can I do for you ? 
 You can apply for one here . 
 If you like , you can apply right now . 
 I ’ m going to need you to complete this application . 
 Then I will take your picture for your passport . 
 Your passport will be ready in a few weeks . 

Can you tell me where I can park ? 
 I drive an automobile . 
 Yes , I have seen those spots . 
 I park in the evenings . 
 Yes , I have seen those signs . 
 Yes , I know what the curb colors mean . 

Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ? 
 I'm done . 
 Sure , here it is . 
 I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ? 
 I see . 

Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting . 
 I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class . 
 I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . 
 Yes , I remember . 
 Sure , no problem . 

Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class . 
 No , I have to do this ; it's important ! 
 I've made arrangements with a friend to help me . 
 Yes , I know . 
 OK , I can do that . 

I would like to register for a class today . 
 I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy . 
 Which days are these classes on ? 
 What about the other class ? 
 Are you sure there are no more open classes ? 
 Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday . 

Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ? 
 Yes , I can write that on my calendar . 
 Yes , I understand . 
 No , I don't have a ride yet . 
 How much will the trip cost ? 

Hello , I need to register for a class . 
 I want to take a Psychology class . 
 Can you tell me what days the classes are on ? 
 And the other class ? 
 Are you sure these are the only open classes ? 
 Okay , sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday . 

Could you help me to register for a class ? 
 Are there any Psychology classes available ? 
 On what days are the classes ? 
 Can you tell me about the other class ? 
 You're positive that these are the only classes left ? 
 The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine . 

You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . 
 What's your method of learning ? 
 What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? 
 That's a good idea . You are really creative . 
 What do you need ? 
 What building is it in ? 
 Oh , I know exactly where that is . 
 Sure , what room number is it ? 
 I have a class around there right now . 
 No problem , come on . 
 What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! 
 Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . 
 Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . 
 I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! 
 You did ? 
 What do you think now ? 
 But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do . 

How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? 
 You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! 
 So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? 
 So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . 

How are you doing with your English Language studies ? 
 Is it harder than you thought ? 

I have a real problem when I meet people . 
 I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . 
 But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . 
 That sounds easy enough . 

What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? 
 I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? 
 Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! 
 I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . 
 So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? 
 In what way ? 
 You are making me feel really discouraged . 

I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? 
 I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . 
 They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . 
 Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . 
 Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . 
 Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . 
 It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . 
 I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . 
 Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . 
 I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . 

Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . 
 Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . 
 Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . 
 You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . 
 I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . 
 It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . 
 Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . 
 Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . 

How's your time spent in the United States ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? 
 You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? 
 That's weird . 
 You really cared about your friend . 
 I'm confused . Why did he say that ? 
 Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . 
 Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? 
 Did you bow back ? 
 Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . 
 Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . 
 I think it's highly possible , yes . 
 That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . 

How long have you been in America ? 
 Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? 

Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 
 What ? 
 What is it ? 
 That makes you feel uncomfortable ? 
 Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . 
 Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . 
 Yeah . 

Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? 
 Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? 
 Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . 
 Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . 
 Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' 

Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 

Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 
 I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? 
 It must be interesting to study English . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 

What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . 
 Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? 
 But , you were born and raised in California ! 
 What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? 
 So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? 
 Are you sure he really got the message ? 
 That's hilarious ! What did he say ? 
 I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 
 Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . 
 Do you want to know something about the American character ? 
 No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . 
 After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? 
 I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 You think ? 
 But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy . 

Eric , how long will you be in China ? 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 
 Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 
 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 How about this sunday ? 
 Good . I'll give you a call tonight . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . 
 I'm majoring in English . 
 Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . 
 I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . 
 You're right . 
 You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . 
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 

Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 What do I do with it ? 
 Please . 
 So I don't have to worry about them . 
 I'll take home economics . 

Excuse me , I need your assistance . 
 I have no idea where my class is . 
 My class is in the C building . 
 Do you mind telling me where it is ? 
 Number 261 . 
 Can you please show me ? 

How are your Chinese lessons going ? 
 Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . 
 Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . 

How often do you have English lessons ? 
 How do you practice ? 
 Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? 

Do you mind helping me ? 
 I'm not sure how to find my next class . 
 The C building , I think . 
 Could you point me in that direction ? 
 It's C261 . 
 Can you show it to me ? 

How do I buy my textbooks ? 
 Yes , I have my list . 
 Yes , I know where the bookstore is . 
 No , I didn't know I could do that . 
 Yes , I am going today . 
 Yes , thank you . That would be great . 

Where can I buy textbooks ? 
 Yes , I have that . 
 No , I don't know where the bookstore is . 
 Really ? How can I do that ? 
 No , I can't make it today . 
 No , thanks . I'm good . 

Do you have the notes from last week's class ? 
 I couldn't make it . 
 I was sick . 
 Are these all of them ? 
 Thanks a bunch . 

Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ? 
 Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great . 
 Is it close by ? 
 OK , I'd love the company . 

When are we leaving for our field trip ? 
 Yes , I will write that down . 
 Yes , I will be there on time . 
 Yes , someone is coming to get me . 
 What should we bring with us ? 

Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ? 
 Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something . 
 Can we walk there ? 
 Of course ! Let's go . 

Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ? 
 I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian , maybe . 
 Good ! Where is it ? 
 That would be great . 

Can you help me buy my textbooks ? 
 No , I don't have that . 
 I am not sure where the bookstore is . 
 Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? 
 I think maybe I could be there . 
 Maybe that would work . 

Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? 
 I want to buy that candy . 
 Yeah , so far , so good . 
 Yeah , I already knew that . 
 OK , let's move on ! 
 I hope it works ! 

I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . 
 I want to buy a drink . 
 I've got the correct change already . 
 OK , what next ? 
 OK , next ? 
 I agree with you . 

I need to find somewhere to park . 
 I need to find a space on campus . 
 Where is the parking structure at ? 
 Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ? 
 How long ago was that ? 
 Do you think it'll be full now ? 

I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . 
 I'm finished . 
 OK , the form is all filled out . 
 No , I have no idea what they are . 
 Yes , right . 

I want to know how to buy something from this machine . 
 I want to buy one of those snack things . 
 I'm clear so far . 
 It won't go in ! 
 Yes , next step . 
 They're totally unreliable . 

I really need to find a parking spot . 
 Do you know any spaces on campus ? 
 Where is it located ? 
 Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? 
 What time was it when you went up there ? 
 It wouldn't be full right now , would it ? 

Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card . 
 OK , here it is . 
 Here's my license and form . 
 Yes , I know what to do . 
 OK . 

Do you know where I can park ? 
 I want a space on campus . 
 Where can I find it ? 
 Is it full ? 
 When was that ? 
 Would it be full now ? 

How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I need your library card . 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 Your books are due back two weeks from today . 

What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Have you checked the computer ? 
 What did it say ? 
 I can always borrow the book from another library . 
 I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . 

What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 We don ’ t allow people to check out magazines . 
 It ’ s just a policy of ours . 
 You may check out books or videos . 
 You will have to just read it in the library . 

May I help you ? 
 May I do anything else for you ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Will that be all for today ? 
 These books are due back in two weeks . 

What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is that all ? 
 May I see your library card , please ? 
 Will that be all for today ? 
 These are due back in two weeks . 

How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 You ’ re not allowed to do that . 
 It ’ s our policy . 
 Only books or videos . 
 You will have to read it here . 

What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is that all ? 
 May I see your library card ? 
 You have to take care of this video . 
 You will be fined if you damage it . 

Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week ? 
 I was unable to make it . 
 I was sick that day , and couldn't make it . 
 Are there any more ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

Let me get last week's notes . 
 I couldn't come . 
 I wasn't feeling well . 
 Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Excuse me , Professor . I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done . 
 I had to watch a football game instead . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 I'll make it up next week . 
 OK , I can do that . 

Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ? 
 Yes , but I have never taken his class before . 
 Yes , that's what I need . 
 Yes , I guess so . 
 Yes , I had a teacher like that before . 
 No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing . 

Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ? 
 I would like to come in at three o'clock . 
 Yes , I can . 
 I got it . 
 Thank you , I'll be there . 

I don't have my homework today . 
 I was really sick . 
 Yes , I probably could . 
 Next class meeting . 
 That would work for me . 

Let me tell you what happened to my homework . 
 Actually , I did it , but then it got lost . 
 Yes , I could . 
 I'll make it up early next week . 
 I'll try . 

I have to miss school next week . 
 Unfortunately , this is what I have to do . 
 I've got it all covered . 
 Don't worry , this will be the last class I miss . 
 I'll remember . 

Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? 
 I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . 
 Yes , I really need someone who is really good . 
 Maybe , but I'm not sure . 
 No , that stuff isn't important to me . 
 I don't care about any of that . 

Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ? 
 I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . 
 I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . 
 I really need to learn this stuff . 
 Yes , that sounds right for me . 
 Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . 

Professor , could I make an appointment with you ? 
 Two o'clock would be the best time . 
 No , I'm not sure . 
 I see . 
 I'll see you then . 

Professor , can you help me add your class ? 
 No , I will have to get an add sheet . 
 No , I don't know where that is . 
 I think I can find it . 
 Thank you for letting me add your class . 

Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today . 
 I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative . 
 Yes , I've got that part covered . 
 I don't need to leave until the very end of class . 
 Thanks , Professor . See you later ! 

I am unsure how to add a class and need help . 
 Yes , I have an add sheet . 
 No , I'm not sure . 
 Thanks . I understand what to do now . 
 That sounds good . 

What date will our field trip be on ? 
 Yes , I will make note of that . 
 I will be there half an hour early . 
 Yes , someone is picking me up . 
 Not at the moment — maybe later , though . 

Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early . 
 I am not feeling well . 
 Yes , it's all taken care of . 
 I can stay a few more minutes . 
 Thanks , Professor . I've got it covered ! 

I am not sure how to add a class . 
 I'll bring one next time . 
 I think I know where it is . 
 Thank you for your directions . It's clear . 
 That's great . Thank you so much . 

Where should I park ? 
 I drive a scooter 
 No , I haven't seen those spots . 
 I park in the daytime . 
 No , I have not seen the signs . 
 No , I don't know what the curb colors mean . 

I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class . 
 I have an appointment . 
 No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . 
 I am leaving right now . 
 Thanks , Professor . I'll make sure everything gets taken care of . 

What is the best place to park ? 
 I drive a motorcycle . 
 I am not sure what a handicapped spot is . 
 I park days and evenings . 
 What signs ? 
 What curb colors ? 

I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester . 
 I am a daytime student . 
 I will be driving my car . 
 I'll pay for it with a check . 
 No , thanks ; I'm fine . 

I have an appointment for half past one . 
 Well , I have a problem with my class schedule . 
 It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time . 
 Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Do you attend school during the day or only at night ? 
 Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile ? 
 Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ? 
 Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle ? 
 OK , here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester . 
 Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings ? 
 Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ? 
 That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card ? 
 Do you need a second permit for a car ? 
 Fine , here it is and have a great semester ! 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Tell me the problem . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Do you still want both classes ? 
 I'll try to change one to a different day . 

Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? 
 Three would be a good time . 
 I'm not sure . 
 OK , I'll find it . 
 See you then . 

I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . 
 There's a problem with my schedule . 
 Two of my classes occur at the same time . 
 Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? 
 I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Sure . Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ? 
 Let's just go over all of it to double-check . 
 Here is the answer sheet . Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right ? 
 OK , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score . 
 Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ? 
 Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention . 
 Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? 
 These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? 
 Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? 
 Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? 
 I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ? 
 Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying ! 
 What do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? 
 I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . Will that work for you ? 
 Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . 
 Yes , I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . Would that be OK ? 
 We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . 
 Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask ! 
 Grades are based on many things 
 Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . 
 Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . 
 I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . 
 You will be able to track your progress during the year . 
 All of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . 
 All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times . 
 The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest . 
 Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence . 
 Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on . 
 Sure ! What exactly do you have questions about ? 
 Well , let me take a look at my grade book . How do YOU think you are doing ? 
 Well , your scores show that you could do a little better . What do you think you could improve on ? 
 Fine ! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . 
 I'm sure you'll do fine . 
 I need to check out this book . 
 I don ’ t have one . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 All right . All done . 
 Okay . I ’ Ve signed it . 
 Great . Now can I check out this book ? 
 I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . 
 Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning . 
 The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent . 
 You can only miss one class without penalty . 
 I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . 
 Of course , how can I help you ? 
 Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ? 
 I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . 
 You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . 
 Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement . 
 Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? 
 Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? 
 I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? 
 Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? 
 Thanks for stopping by ! 
 Could I check out this book ? 
 I need to get one . 
 Okay . Let me do that right now . 
 I ’ m finished . Here you go . 
 All right . 
 Now may I check this book out ? 
 I ’ m returning these books . 
 Here are all of them . 
 I didn ’ t have time to return them . 
 How much ? 
 25 cents a day ? 
 That ’ s expensive . 
 I would like to return some books . 
 Here you go . 
 Yeah . I totally forgot they were due . 
 How much are the late fees ? 
 I have to pay 25 cents a day ? 
 That shouldn ’ t be a problem .

 How much are you talking ? 
 That ’ s not bad at all .

 No problem . Have a good one . 
 I would like to find this book . 
 I don ’ t think you guys have it . 
 I did that . 
 It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . 
 I didn ’ t know you could do that . 
 I appreciate your help . 
 I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . 
 I already did . 
 I didn ’ t see it . 
 Will you ever get another copy ? 
 Could you please reserve it for me ? 
 Thanks . I really appreciate that . 
 I couldn ’ t find the book I was looking for . 
 I checked .

 Would you be able to reserve it for me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I need to return these books . 
 Here they are . 
 I forgot they were due . 
 How much is the late fee ? 
 So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ? 
 That ’ s a lot of money . 
 I ’ m returning a book . 
 I also need to check out this video . 
 Just the video . 
 I have it right here .

 Could you reserve a copy for me ? 
 That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . 
 I want to get a passport . 
 When can I apply for it ? 
 I ’ d like to do that . 
 What ’ s next ? 
 When will my passport be ready ? 
 That ’ s great . Thank you . 
 I ’ m looking for this book . 
 I don ’ t see it on the shelf . 
 I already looked . 
 It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t . 
 Could you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Thank you so much . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I also want to check out this video . 
 That ’ s all I need . 
 Here it is . 
 That won ’ t be a problem . 
 I won ’ t damage it . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I would also like to check out this magazine . 
 Why is that ? 
 What things am I allowed to check out ? 
 I really need to check out this magazine . 
 That ’ s stupid . 
 I need to get a passport . 
 When will I be able to do that ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Then what do I do ? 
 How long will it take for my passport to be ready ? 
 That ’ s perfect . 
 I would like to check out these books . 
 Yes . Here you go . 
 I do ? 
 Exactly how much do I owe ? 
 I won ’ t be able to pay that right now . 
 I will pay it . Don ’ t worry . 
 I need to make some copies . 
 Does it cost to use it ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 How many copies am I allowed to make ? 
 Would you mind showing me how to use it ? 
 Oh , okay . Thanks . 
 I need to copy some pages in my book . 
 Do I need to pay to use it ? 
 How much do you charge ? 
 Is there a maximum number of copies I can make ? 
 I ’ m going to need you to show me how to use the machine . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 I need to use the Internet . 
 Yes , I do .

 How do I log on to the computer ? 
 Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . 
 I need to get on the Internet . 
 Yes , I have it . 
 That ’ s okay . 
 Then what do I need to do ? 
 What do I do to log on to the computer ? 
 Okay . Thanks for your help . 
 I would like to use a computer . 
 I sure do . 
 That ’ s all right .

 How am I supposed to log on to the computer ? 
 That ’ s it ? Thank you very much .

 Does it close at that time every day ?

 What time do you open and close on Saturday ? 
 Okay . Thank you very much . 
 No , that ’ s all . Thanks . 
 I ’ m fine . Thank you .

 Does it always close at six ?

 I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ? 
 which country do you want to go to ? 
 have you applied to any schools there ? 
 congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ? 
 if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ? 
 if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future . 
 if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed . 
 fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
 yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
 no . 
 that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ? 
 yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan . 
 never . 
 no , I want to come back to China after I graduate . 
 I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying . 
 that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . 
 much better than it did yesterday . 
 I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! 
 thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . 
 did you always do well at school ? 
 really ? 
 I'll get my finals in two months . 
 most students just cram the night forehead . 
 no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . 
 I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . 

how was school today , Dominic ? 
 why ? What happened ? 
 it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ? 
 why didn't you do a good job ? 
 do you think you studied enough for the exam ? 
 what did you do last night ? 
 did you study at all last night for your exam ? 
 I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ? 
 alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare . 
 hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 
 it ’ s about bob Dylan . 
 he ’ s a famous American musician . 
 it was written by Howard sounds . 
 it ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot form reading it . 
 sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . 
 there are 15 chapters in total . 
 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . 
 no problem . Bob . 
 Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . 
 They did . 
 Seventy to sixty-seven . 
 i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work . 
 right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes . 
 yes , I learned how to speak it when I was little . 
 well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages . 
 I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . 
 about two weeks ago . 
 I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . 
 You know me ; I'm always studying ! 
 Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! 
 Rather difficult . How about you ? 
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . 
 That's because you did well . 
 Why ? 

are you looking for a course ? 
 what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ? 
 what kind of course are you looking for ? 
 do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ? 
 have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ? 
 that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . 
 one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . 
 sure . Here's a brochure about out English classes that meet in the evenings . 

did you go to university ? 
 when did you graduate ? 
 I just graduated from high school . 
 I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go . 
 yes , I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them . 
 the tuition is the same for all of them . 
 I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . 
 I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . 
 not yet . 
 that's a good idea . 

can I see your passport , please ? 
 yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right . 
 what's the expiration date on your passport ? 
 I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK . 
 do you have anything to declare ? 
 how long will you be staying in the UK ? 
 what is the purpose of your stay ? 
 where will you be staying ? 
 how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ? 
 ok . Have a good day . Here's your passport and documents back . 

Hi.Ed , what's up ? 
 Doesn't look like it to me . 
 Woo , easy . 
 What are you so ticked off about ? 
 Maybe I could help . 
 You've got be joking . 
 Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . 
 fine , thanks . How are you ? 
 oh , my lord . I haven't really started them . 
 I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . 
 to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha 

Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? 
 Hey , Chillon , I'm just trying to help . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
 That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next master . 
 You can't do that , Jenny ! 
 Come on , let's talk about it . 
 the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! 
 certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? 
 oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . 
 what do most of the students do ? 
 then , I might as well have them made . 
 hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . 
 here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? 

why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! 
 it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . 
 why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . 
 that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? 
 I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . 
 just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . 
 sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . 
 sure . Good luck , Maria ! 
 oh yeah ? 
 how did you feel when you graduated ? 
 what did you do after graduation ? 
 sounds like you're happy with your decision . 
 it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . 
 while seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . 
 I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . 

You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? 
 Do you have a clear career path to follow ? 
 what kind of job do you want after graduation ? 
 wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? 
 yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . 
 no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working 

how was your education going on in Australia ? 
 where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? 
 why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
 yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . 
 the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home . 

Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? 
 Where is the school cafeteria ? 
 Where is the Computer Center ? 
 Where is the library ? 
 Thank you . I will go get one . 
 Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . 
 You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye . 

hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? 
 oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? 
 cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! 
 that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? 
 you mean you got working experience , right ? 
 it must be very demanding . 
 really ? It sounds interesting . 
 great . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? 

What can I do ? 
 Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? 
 All right . 
 These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? 
 Thanks , John . 
 but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . 
 it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . 
 it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . 
 that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? 
 sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . 
 hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . 
 that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . 
 ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . 
 perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! 
 I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
 Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . 
 Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . 
 Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? 

What are you reading ? 
 I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
 We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ? 
 Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
 This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 
 I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . 
 No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . 
 I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . 
 The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . 

Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? 
 Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? 
 Are the reports favorable ? 
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 
 I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . 

I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
 I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
 You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? 
 Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . 

Do you buy that newspaper every day ? 
 Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? 
 What section does it have ? 
 What ’ s in that section ? 
 I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . 
 It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . 
 Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan – so beginning again 
 The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
 Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . 
 Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? 
 First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . 
 It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . 
 Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . 
 No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . 
 So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? 
 That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . 
 How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . 

What are you reading about in that science magazine ? 
 I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . 
 In the future , that could be possible . 
 Really ? What else have you discovered ? 
 That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . 
 Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . 
 Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
 It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
 Is that better ? 
 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 

Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! 
 That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , 
 Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . 
 Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
 Well , there is that , yes . 
 I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . 
 For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! 
 Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! 

Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . 
 Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . 
 Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . 

What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . 
 I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . 
 A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
 Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . 
 There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! 
 Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? 
 Cinct de mayo ? 
 Do we get a day off from school then ? 
 Www , man ! 
 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
 And then what happened ? 

Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? 
 That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . 
 Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . 
 Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . 
 Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . 
 As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . 

Do you know where you want to transfer to ? 
 What school would you like to go to ? 
 You honestly have no idea ? 
 You might as well stay here . 
 PCC is a wonderful institution . 
 So , what are you going to do ? 

You got a letter in the mail . 
 What is it ? 
 What does it say ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Good for you ! 
 I ’ m so proud of you . 

Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? 
 Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . 
 All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . 
 That's exactly what I want , thank you . 
 Calm down . 
 Give it to me . 
 It ’ s from NYU . 
 I didn ’ t get accepted . 
 I ’ m serious . 
 NYU was my first choice . 
 I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . 
 Who was it ? 
 She never cares about others . 
 Her new boyfriend , right ? 
 I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing . 
 What happened ? 
 That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . 
 I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . 
 Sounds good . 
 Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . 

Here ’ s a letter for you . 
 Who ’ s the letter from ? 
 Read it ! 
 Really ? 
 I ’ m so happy for you ! 
 I am really proud of you . 

I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Sure.He has already married , a father of two boys . 
 He took the picture when he was only 21 years old . 

I got the job you recommended me for last week . 
 I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 
 Thank you very much indeed.You helped me rebuild my self-confidence . 
 That would be great . 
 And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . 

To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . 
 How could you manage to pass the exam ? 

You seem to be very hesitant about doing things . 
 You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess . 
 That's where the shoe pinches . 
 Don't worry . I'll drive you back . 

Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? 
 Oh , but why ? 

My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . 
 Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
 His parents must feel very happy . 
 I really want to take him over my knee . 
 If you say so ! 
 But I like its color . 
 I'll take one , too . 
 I feel eggplants are more nutritious . 
 Oh , that's how you see it . 
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 
 It's my dream . 
 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 
 But it's only a film . 
 What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . 
 Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! 
 Oh look ! Here it comes now ! 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . 

I feel so uncomfortable . 
 No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . 

I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
 I feel he's like a talking machine . 

I wish you would not be so selfish . 
 But you should at least consider your son's future . 

Tom set the whole country by the ears with his discovery . 
 He was very clever when he was a boy . 
 That black sheep . It serves him right . 
 It ’ s too late . 
 Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . 

Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . 
 That ’ s too much . 

The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . 
 He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . 
 Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . 
 He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . 
 I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She is really something . 
 About my boyfriend . 
 You are really a wet blanket . 
 What is over ? 
 Any reasons ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . 
 You've done a lot , my darling ! 
 You're too strict with yourself . 

My son came home from three years in the navy . 
 Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
 What is it ? 
 Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? 

Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . 
 But don't forget you are in a cafe . 
 I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . 
 You should feel shameful for your behavior . 
 I'm really sick of you . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 Why don't you ask your husband to help you with it ? 

It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
 I can't forget it . 

David , I ’ m going to China . 
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
 I ’ m sure I will . 
 Thank you , David . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Oh ... 
 Sorry , love . 
 My cigarettes . 
 In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? 
 What fools we were ! 
 And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . 
 I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . 
 And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . 
 It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . 
 I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . 
 Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Think a little . I think he means well at the bottom of his heart . 
 Yeah . 
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
 Partly , and he's also a hardworking man . 
 What's the cause ? 
 I see why it lags behind other towns . 
 What is it ? 
 There must be something wrong with her . 
 Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . 
 Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . 
 Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . 
 No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . 
 He has no sense . 
 But Joe won't you . 
 Can you take he away from me ? 
 She kept on bothering me . 
 But I am her brother , not her servant . 
 I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . 
 She's my sister , you know . 
 He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . 
 It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . 
 Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . 
 You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . 
 She does have a heart of gold . 

Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . 
 You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . 
 Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . 
 It surely is . 
 Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? 
 I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . 
 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 

I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . 
 Maybe I'll have to face the music . 
 The boy is good for nothing . 
 He is hopeless . 
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
 Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . 
 What scene ? 

My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . 
 Not often . Just when I make mistakes . 
 Yeah . He really does let me down . 
 I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . 
 Why ? 
 Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . 
 That would be terrible . 
 Oh , how were you saved finally ? 

Our house is too small . We had better have a big one . 
 Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . 
 What are you talking about ? 
 You said it . Many parents just don ’ t understand know how to educate their children . 
 My brother did it . 
 I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . 
 Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . 
 Right . Unless , who know what will happen . 

Why do you look so sad ? 
 Why not go and see a doctor ? 

What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! 
 It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . 
 Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . 

I ’ m itching for moving ! 
 It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . 
 Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... 
 You were playing it very late last night . 
 It kept me awake . 
 It kept me awake a couple of hours . 
 It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me . 
 I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . 
 I am glad we've straightened everything out . 
 How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English . 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 It's amazing . 
 Can you believe I'm going to America ? 
 Yes , I'm really excited . 
 I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . 
 Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . 
 So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . 
 About what ? 
 Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . 
 No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . 
 Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? 
 Alright , let's go . 

Can I borrow some money from you ? 

Hi ! Wang Mei.Come and have a look at my new dress . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 I bought it in a store near my school . 
 It's only thirty yuan . 
 I'll go together with you . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 

Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 

I got a raise . 

Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ? 

You're looking great . 

Congratulations ! You've just won a car ! 

Bob , I'm really upset with you . 
 You forgot it last year as well . 

Mary , be calm . 
 No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you . 
 No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... 
 OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . 

Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? 
 And , her lips ? 
 And her voice like a lark's song ? 
 Oh , she sings too ? 

How could you have done that without asking me first ? 
 Well , you should have thought . 

Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on . 
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 
 No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? 
 When did you go there ? 
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 
 I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . 

You're my hero . 

Hey , Cindy , I'm so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone . 
 I don't know what happened to me . I just lost it . 
 Yeah , you're right . Good night . 
 I knew this would happen some day . 
 Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . 
 I think we can still talk . 
 Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? 

I couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful ! 
 No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ? 
 You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ? 
 Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long . 
 Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . 
 I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . 

I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . 
 I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow . 

Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations ! 

I'm afraid I've spilt ink all over the table-cloth . 
 I'm terribly sorry . Won't you let me pay for it ? 

I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . 

Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . 
 I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . 
 I start next Monday . 
 I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . 
 Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? 
 Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? 
 I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . 

Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? 

Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . 

I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . 
 However , he disappointed us very much this time . 

What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . 
 Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . 
 Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? 
 Have you discussed it with your wife ? 
 As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . 

Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? 
 Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . 
 But this chance is really precious . 
 I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . 

I don't want to do the damn dishes . 

The teacher should give us more time to complete this assignment . 

I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
 What did you think you were doing ? 
 How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
 Never do that again . 

Look at that pretty girl . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should tell me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You are all the same . 
 Come on ! You're pulling my leg . 
 Wow ! Congratulations ! 
 I accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . I'm really sorry . 

Are you listening to me , Dan ? 
 What did I just say ? 
 Just what I thought ! 
 I bought it when I was on vacation in Nepal . 
 Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it . 

That's a very nice pair of glasses . 
 Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . 
 That's incredible ! 
 Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks . 
 But I don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do . 

You look like being on cloud nine . 
 What has made you so happy ? 
 Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? 
 How did you meet her ? 
 What do you like best about her ? 
 I guess it was fate working to bring you together . 

I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . 
 What of it ? 

Hello , Dora , I haven't seen you for a long time . Where have you been ? 
 What's up ? You look unhappy . 
 Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . 
 Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . 
 Not at all . We are friends . 
 Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . 
 No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . 
 It's a promise . 
 Do you think it looks good on me ? 
 You won't believe it , but it was really cheap . 

I love that vase . 
 Yes , it looks perfect . 
 That's amazing ! 
 Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . 
 Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . 
 You are quite right . 
 Do you think it fits me ? 
 I bought it at half price . 

Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . 
 I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . 
 It is real word . 

I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! 
 When are you going ? 

I have just had my new paper published . 
 I'm going to Britain . 
 I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD . 
 I really appreciate your kind words . 
 Sorry . Were you trying to sleep ? 
 I'm sorry . You're right . I should have asked . 
 Thank you . 
 I will try my best . 
 I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? 
 I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . 
 Sorry . Was I disturbing you ? 
 Sorry . I guess I wasn't thinking . I won't do it again . 
 Yes , it's most irritating . 
 We're going to do something about it . 
 We can't put up with it any more . 
 I don't think so . 
 Why don't we call them ? 

Do you think you could keep the noise down ? 
 Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? 

Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? 
 You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? 
 Did you tell your parents yet ? 
 They're probably going to be so happy . 

Hello ? 
 I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ? 
 What did you watch ? 
 I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary . 
 Sure . I can come over . What should we do ? 
 Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes . 
 Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon . 

Hello , Mary . What ’ s the matter with you ? You look upset . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ’ t be sad . 
 OK . Don ’ t let it get to you . Goodbye . 
 Just get out of my face , would you ? 
 Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything ! 
 Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? 
 Get out of here ! 
 Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! 
 Wow , that's great ! 
 You ! 
 You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? 
 She started feeling suspicious after you said that . 
 Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . 
 Don't bother . 
 Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , did you ? That's very easy to do . 
 Yes , the fried chicken is too hard to eat . I suggest you bring me another one free of charge . 
 OK . I will talk to him direcly . 
 Thank you . 
 She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . 
 Thank you . 
 No , that's not right . I didn't order a coffee . I ordered a cola . 
 Waiter ! 
 It's not that . There's an animal in my soup . 
 I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . 

David , why don't you clean your room ? 
 Why are you feeling depress ? 
 I don't think she would do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 

Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 
 Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 

Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . 
 Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . 
 And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . 
 That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . 
 Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . 
 Sorry , I'll bring them to you right away . 
 We are short of staff today . 
 What's wrong ? 
 They were delivered this morning . 

You ’ re making my blood boil . 
 I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . 
 Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? 
 Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! 

Look what you've done ! 
 Yes , and hurry up ! 
 No , I'll do it myself . 
 I should think so , too ! 
 Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! 
 That's OK . 
 Don ’ t think any more about it . 
 It ’ s really not necessary . I know your intention was good . 

You received a letter in the mail . 
 Who ’ s the letter from ? 
 I want to know what it says . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Are you okay ? 
 I am really sorry to hear that . 

Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? 
 Thanks . 
 I want to study abroad . 
 I hope to study English Literature . 
 Not yet . I have an interview with a visa official today . 
 No , I ’ Ve already been here for 3 interviews . 
 Let me see it . 
 It ’ s a letter from NYU . 
 I didn ’ t get in . 
 I ’ m not lying . 
 I had high hopes for NYU . 
 Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . 
 The brain ! 
 The heart ! 
 The stomach and intestines ! 
 Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! 
 So what do these organs do , teacher ? 

Hey Stacy . What's going on ? 
 Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ? 
 How about your husband . Does he help much ? 
 That sucks . 
 That's crossing the line . 

Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? 
 Thanks ! 
 I want to study abroad . 
 I hope to study English literature . 
 Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today . 
 No , I've already been to here for three interviews . 
 I was denied a visa ? 
 Like most students . I want to work in America after graduation . 

Guess what came in the mail today ? 
 My acceptance letter to Yale ! 
 Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . 
 Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . 
 Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? 
 Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . 
 I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . 
 In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . 
 Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . 
 oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . 
 maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . 
 It's my geography , sir . The Map of Africa you set us . 
 Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . 
 My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
 It's true , sir . 
 Does the class start again , Mam ? 
 Oh , breaktime flies . 
 Mam , another minute , could I ? 

I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! 
 No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . 
 Good idea . That might help . 
 Yeah . 
 Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . 
 Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . 
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 
 How about tomorrow night ? 

Does she make any sense to you ? 
 She's speaking French , not Greek . 
 Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . 

Are you a newcomer ? 
 You speak good English , though . 
 But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ? 

Are you new here ? 
 Is this your first year in college ? 
 Which school ? 
 How do you like it here compared to PCC ? 
 Do you like it better here or at PCC ? 
 So , why did you leave PCC ? 

You must be new . 
 Have you just started college ? 
 What school ? 
 Do you like it here ? 
 Do you like it better here or at PCC ? 
 If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? 

You ’ re new here , right ? 
 Will this be your first year ? 
 What school did you come from ? 
 Why ’ d you transfer here ? 
 Is PCC a good school ? 
 I hope you enjoy it here . 

You ’ re ready , right ? 
 Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ? 
 You ’ re not nervous ? 
 What are you most nervous about ? 
 You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that . 
 Meeting new people is a good thing . 

Are you new to this school ? 
 Is this your first year in college ? 
 Where did you transfer from ? 
 Why did you transfer ? 
 Did you like it at PCC ? 
 Well , I wish you luck here . 

You ’ re new here , right ? 
 Is this your first semester ? 
 What school did you transfer from ? 
 Do you like it here so far ? 
 Which is better , here or PCC ? 
 Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ? 

Are you new here ? 
 Are you a freshman in college ? 
 What school did you transfer from ? 
 What made you transfer ? 
 Did you like PCC ? 
 Good luck here . 

Where are you planning on transferring to ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 You haven ’ t thought about it ? 
 Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? 
 It ’ s a great school . 
 So , have you made your decision yet ? 

You ready ? 
 Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? 
 You ’ re not nervous , are you ? 
 Why are you nervous ? 
 That ’ s not a problem . 
 It ’ s fun meeting new people . 

Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? 
 Where would you like to go to school ? 
 You can ’ t think of anything ? 
 So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? 
 It ’ s a perfectly good school . 
 Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? 

Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? 
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 
 Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? 

Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . 
 You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . 
 Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . 
 As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . 
 No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . 
 Bob . 
 That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . 
 We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . 
 Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? 
 Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? 
 That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . 
 How dreadful ! 
 Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . 
 I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . 

Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? 
 Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . 
 Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . 
 Zina ? Zina the Snake ? 
 Yeah ? Which one was that ? 
 Right . That one . Did it work ? 
 Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . 
 ... and maybe that's what we both need . 
 OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . 
 I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! 
 Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
 Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! 
 Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
 I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . 

Oh , no . It looks like we're late . 
 There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? 
 That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . 

Hurry up ! Time is money ! 
 But you are too slow to follow them . 

What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 Oh , no ... 
 Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? 
 Women are such dreamers . 

Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . 
 What happened ? 

Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 

Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . 
 All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . 
 Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . 

I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? 
 It's really very easy saying you're sorry . 

Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . 
 That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 
 I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . 
 That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . 
 Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . 
 You're kidding ! 
 I know he really deserves this . 
 Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . 
 Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . 
 Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . 
 It spoiled my painting ! 
 I'm glad I could help . 
 You didn't have to do that ! 

The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? 
 It better be more than last year . 

What do you think about violence in movies ? 
 But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? 

I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . 
 Why not ? 
 What are you talking about , we tried everything ! 
 Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . 
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . 
 Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
 But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
 I don't care . 
 I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . 
 Yes , too good to be true . 
 The last straw , huh ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 There's no need to apologize . 
 Forget it . It was an accident . 
 I tried . You were preoccupied . 
 You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . 
 So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . 
 Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . 
 My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . 
 Yes , I have . But I have to wait . 
 What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . 
 You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . 
 Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . 
 Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago . 
 Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry . 

It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . 
 This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... 
 But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? 

You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? 
 I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? 
 How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . 

You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days . 
 But you're not to blame for them keeping him there . 
 I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy . 

Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message . 
 That's OK . Just let it out . I'm OK ! I was out of town with ... Femi . 
 Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . 
 It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . 
 Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . 
 It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . 
 Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants . 
 It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! 
 Time for what ? 
 You mean get married now ? On the plane ? 
 I don't know what to say , Jack ! 

Are you ready to go to the mall ? 
 Copycat ! 
 You went out and bought khakis , too ! 
 Whatever . 
 No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... 
 They're going to give us back the seats ? 
 Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? 
 Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! 
 You have much patience . 
 Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet . 
 This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " 
 No . I never sell my artwork . 
 I give it away . Here , this one is for you . 
 Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ... 
 But not as good as your mother's , right ? 
 What ? Are you kidding ? 
 Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! 

Thanks for helping me up . 
 I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over ! 
 I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing ! 

Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? 
 Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! 
 I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? 
 Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . 
 He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . 
 Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek ! 
 It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... 
 I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? 

Did you go to the movie yesterday ? 
 What did you think of it ? 
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . 
 I can't think the same . 
 I couldn't agree with you . 
 I hope nothing is wrong . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Oh , no . Is it serious ? 
 Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . 
 Not at all . 
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 Thank you . 
 He is fine . 
 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 I think a mountain village is splendid ! 
 It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . 
 But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! 

What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 

I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
 Have a nice journey , Lily . 

David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 
 I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 

You ’ re all set now ? 
 Really , it was nothing . 
 I was happy to help . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 

You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? 
 Really ? Congratulations ! 
 By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . 
 Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . 
 Well , I missed several buses . 
 I , ah ... , I got have late . 
 Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... 
 Yes , I found it again . 
 This morning . I mean ... 

Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 But they ’ re very nice , you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . 
 It doesn ’ t matter to me . 
 Either way . I don ’ t care . 
 I couldn ’ t careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I ’ m not crazy about it at all . 
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
 I hate it . 
 It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . 
 It's us . 
 Well , you always say you're busy . 
 And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . 
 Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . 
 Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
 How did they hear ? No one called . 
 His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . 
 Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . 

Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 
 The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 
 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 I apologize for their tardiness . 
 Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . 
 I'm going to refund your money right now . 
 But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ... 
 This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . 
 The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . 
 Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . 
 No , I forgot to buy some . 
 We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . 
 Run ! They are thirsty for more ! 
 Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . 
 It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . 
 No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . 
 Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . 
 Is everything OK ? 
 Come in ! Quickly ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . 
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . 
 You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! 
 What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . 
 Call the police . 
 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
 I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
 Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . 

It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . 
 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
 I'm sorry . 
 You are so thoughtful . 
 It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . 

I think that ’ s settled . 
 How dare you speak to me like this . 

You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 
 But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? 
 So beat the cat , but don't kill it . 
 What does his dad say ? 

It ’ s really terrible ! 
 Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . 

What are you thinking about ? 
 Again ! 

Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 

How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! 
 Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . 
 He's after your own heart , it is important . 
 I promise ! 
 Married whom ? 
 Come on . Tell me what happened . 
 Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ? 
 Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . 

You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? 
 Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? 

You seem to have all the jitters about Jane . 
 Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon . 

Are you an American ? 
 Why don't you speak English ? 
 Oh , do you like Chinese ? 
 I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? 
 When will we begin ? 
 That's all right . 
 Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her . 
 Honey , cheer up . 
 I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best . 
 Be confident , and never give up . 
 Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . 

I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! 
 No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . 
 Good idea . That might help . 
 Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . 
 She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? 
 Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . 

Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? 
 Well , you can have all my carrots . 
 Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert . 
 No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots . 
 I know , but chocolate cake is even better . 
 Well , actually , I don't mind eating carrots , but chocolate cakes are much better . You know I was born with a sweet tooth . 
 You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again . 
 But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table . 
 Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . 
 Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . 
 Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . 
 Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . 
 Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . 
 That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . 
 Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . 
 To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! 
 Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . 
 He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . 
 Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly . 
 Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . 
 Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . 
 Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . 
 Really ? Do I have to do it ? 
 Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? 
 No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 what question ? 
 you know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . 
 I---I don ’ t feel like saying it . 
 Maybe it was Dick . 
 Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 He borrowed it from Nick . 
 He was too desperate to find some other way . 
 What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . 
 Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . 
 But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . 
 Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . 
 Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . 
 How about a training course ? 
 But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . 
 OK . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I'm telling you now . 
 I didn't think you'd be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 

Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , no . 
 This machine is out of order . 
 I sure did . 

How was the movie last night ? 
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
 She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . 
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
 Perfect . Couldn't be better ! 
 It's just what I wanted . 
 I'm really pleased with it . Thanks . 
 It's super . 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 What a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? 
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . 
 What am I to do ? 

Are you Elvin ? 
 I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed . 
 It is ? 
 I can't take the credit for that . I'm just Zina's assistant . She's the pro . 
 Stay away from me . 
 I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . 
 Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . 
 I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know . 
 Let's just say there could be some big changes around here . 
 You'll see . Oh , yeah , you'll see . 

Just remember . The main thing right now is to make sure Stars.com is happy . 
 Elvin , please . Can I count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ? 
 By the way , how's the nose ? Boy , that must have hurt . 
 I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . 
 It'll be close , but we'll make it . 
 And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . 
 You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . 
 You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . 
 I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? 
 What ? 
 What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 
 Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 

I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 
 Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . 

All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . 
 Then why are you wearing black shoes ? 
 Hey , thanks , mum . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Which room are you in ? 
 I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . 
 I'm sorry . I forget all about it . 
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . 
 I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
 Excuse me.What did you say ? 
 That's incredible . I cann't believe it . 
 How amazing ! 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . 
 That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . 
 Do you ? 
 They look all right to me . 
 All right . All right . 
 Nothing . 
 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 

David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 
 I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 

What he said disappointed me . 
 He advised me to change to a more suitable course . 
 He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . 

Mum , can I finish my homework later ? 
 But I want to watch TV now . 
 Please . 
 Not even for an hour ? 

What's the matter ? You don't look well . 
 What about ? 
 Oh , is that all ? 
 Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
 Yes , please . That is very kind of you . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty . 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . 
 Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . 
 It's nice of you to say so . 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . 
 It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . 
 Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? 

I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree . 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 

Maybe we'd better go now . 
 Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . 
 OK.Hurry up . 
 I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble . 
 I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin . 
 Yes , it is . 

Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? 
 Why ? 
 I agree with you . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 
 how old is she ? 

Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good.Let ' s go now . 

What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . 
 Sure . 
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
 Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . 
 Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . 
 I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 

Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . 
 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . 
 Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . 
 It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . 
 You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? 
 That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . 
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 
 Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
 It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
 No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . 
 Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? 
 He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . 
 He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . 
 No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 
 I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . 
 You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 
 Really , it's so beautiful . 
 You mustn't pick it in this place . 
 It's a private garden . 
 Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . 
 Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . 
 Stolen ? No , why ? 
 Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless . 
 If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened . 
 Didn't anyone stop them ? 
 Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all . 

Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? 
 Well , come and talk to me then . 
 May I turn on the radio then ? 
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . 

Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 

OK . Come back into the classroom , class . 
 Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . 
 Come on , baby . It ’ s time now . 
 Hurry up , little boy . 
 Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... 
 Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... 
 Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . 
 Really ? There aren't many left now . 
 Were there any animals in the forest ? 

Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , no . 
 This machine is out of order . 
 I sure did . 

Mom , have we got any cookies ? 
 I know , but I'm hungry . 
 Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? 
 120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ? 
 Just don't come looking to me for help . 
 I'm signing off . 

On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 

Who did the stupid thing ? 
 No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
 They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .

 It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . 
 What's the difference ? 
 What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? 
 But they are not as convenient as the subway . 
 Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . 
 What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . 

I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
 I feel he's like a talking machine . 

Are you there , Mary ? 
 How much is my stamp ? 
 Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . 

Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . 
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? 
 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . 

Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 

How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! 
 Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . 

What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken ! 
 You have a real talent , Ellen ! 

I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! 
 I think you deserve a promotion . 

Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? 
 If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . 

How's your new apartment ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Does it make a lot of noise ? 

You're going to abandon me , just like that ? 

When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . 

I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . 

I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time 
 Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? 

One of my students told me she was very depressed today . 
 Her father is dying . 
 Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . 
 I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . 
 Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . 

Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . 
 Why are we watching it anyway ? 
 True . True . 
 Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? 
 You want something to drink ? 
 Sure . 

Did you hear what she said to me ? 
 What do you think I should do about it ? 

How would you like your hair cut ? 
 Then , I'll just trim it . 

I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg . 
 Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . 
 I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . 
 Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? 
 I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . 
 I ’ m so sorry I ’ m late . But Henry ’ s car broke down . 
 I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . 
 Your Rose is a fool . 
 Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? 
 Well , Mr . King is singing . 
 He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . 
 She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . 
 The ladder ’ s falling ? 
 He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . 
 No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . 

Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ? 
 Why do you say such words ? I love you very much . 
 Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . 
 Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . 
 But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... 

I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? 
 I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny . 
 I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . 
 About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . 
 About 2 o ’ clock . 
 You did , but I can ’ t help it . 
 Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . 
 Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . 
 What is it ? 
 All right . 
 No problem . I'd be happy to . 

Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown . 
 Yes , we are very proud of her . 
 Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? 
 I'd like to see that myself . 
 Certainly . 
 Who cares ? She is pretty . 
 You're just jealous . 
 No , I missed it . 
 Someone was in the way . 
 You have any idea why ? 
 I heard her boyfriend is married . 
 Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? 

Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . 
 What do you mean ? 

When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . 
 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 

I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . 
 But I ruined your rug . 

Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 

Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! 
 Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . 
 Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? 
 Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 
 It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . 
 You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . 
 You do ? OK , fine with me . 
 But I also want ya to do me a favor . 
 You gotta have some better deodorant . 

Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? 
 Oh you ’ re so kind ! 

Any chance of using your telephone ? 
 Well , I thought it was not that serious . 
 You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . 
 He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . 
 You think he might stay even longer ? ! 
 That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 
 He never came . 
 I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? 
 Maybe , there was a subway accident . 
 A train got trapped underground with him inside . 
 And you know , how those express trains create suction . 
 Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . 
 That ’ d be fine . 
 I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . 
 That ’ s alright . 
 Oh , that ’ s alright . 
 No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that . 
 I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . 
 Have you found anything yet ? 
 You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . 
 But the parking might be . 

I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? 

Would you mind doing something for me ? 
 Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? 

I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days . 
 Until next weekend . that ’ s ok . 
 It ’ s huge . 
 Yes , of course . 

Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers 
 Until Monday or Tuesday next week . 

Adam . I ’ m sorry . 
 Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . 
 Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . 
 Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . 

This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? 
 Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . 
 Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? 
 Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . 

You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? 
 Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? 
 You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... 
 Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? 
 You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . 
 I hope you will have second thoughts . 
 You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . 
 Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike . 
 ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . 
 Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . 
 Why would I spy on you ? 
 The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . 
 Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . 
 Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . 
 Are you done ? 
 Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? 
 Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do . 
 Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo . 
 Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise . 

I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . 
 Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . 

How many orders do we still need to pack , Gale ? We've been packing all day . 
 Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out . 
 Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning 
 See . Great minds think alike . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . 
 Well , actually it ’ s just about luck . 
 A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . 
 I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . 
 I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . 
 Again ? 
 Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . 
 Maybe by then it will be too late . 
 By that time , you will be fired . 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 

Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? 
 Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . 
 All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . 
 That's exactly what I want , thank you . 
 Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? 
 Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . 
 Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , then the other . 

I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 
 You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 
 Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . 

How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets . 
 I am glad you are happy . 

I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
 What did you think you were doing ? 
 How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
 Never do that again . 

Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? 
 Well , come over and talk to me then . 
 May I turn on the TV then ? 
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . 

Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . 
 The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . 

Hey , sorry to be late . 
 My mother was ill . I had to look after her . 

Excuse me , I wonder if you could help me ? 
 Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . 
 Well , the traffic is very loud . I got no sleep last night . 

Is anything the matter , sir ? 
 What's wrong with it , sir ? 
 I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? 
 I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? 
 Can I bring you some dessert ? 
 How about some coffee or tea then ? 

Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . 

Hello , Is this EYE computers ? 
 Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . 
 Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . 

I must apologize for having delayed the work . 
 But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry 

On , darn . The grocery store is closed . 
 Alright . We are out of everything . 
 I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . 
 I know . Three dollars for milk . 
 That's absolutely ridiculous ! 
 Yes , can I return this article , please ? 
 You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . 
 Last Saturday . 
 Yes , here you are . 

I hate to see the abuse of animals . 

I really dislike reading academic books . 

The academy is an important part of the education system . 

Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? 

I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! 
 Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ? 
 Well . Since you ’ d like an honest answer , I will tell you the truth . 
 We ’ Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation ! 

Eric , how long will you be in China ? 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 
 Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 
 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 How about this sunday ? 
 Good . I'll give you a call tonight . 
 Bye . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I am telling you now . 
 I didn't think you would be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 

David , why don't you clean your room ? 
 Why are you feeling depress ? 
 I don't think she would do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 

The concert was really great . 
 The singing group used to be very popular . 

Thanks for lunch . It was delicious . 
 Next time lunch is on me . 
 I'm serious . 
 It's a deal . 
 Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . 
 Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! 
 No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more . 
 I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack . 

I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . 
 You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . 
 Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! 
 How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . 
 Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . 
 What about the Yen ? 

This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives . 
 3000 RIB as bonus for each person . 
 Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch . 
 At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . 
 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
 My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . 
 Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . 
 Sure . What do you want ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 
 Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . 

The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 You dance beautifully too . 
 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 

Excuse me . In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . 
 Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film . 
 We will keep and return it later . 
 You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . 
 These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . 
 We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . 

Yes , sir ? 
 I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . 
 Yes , may I help you ? 
 What is your reservation number ? 
 Let me see . Oh , yes , we have your reservation number . 
 I ’ m sorry to say no . 

are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! 
 Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... 
 What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . 
 That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? 
 it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! 
 Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . 
 Madam , patience is a virtue . 
 I'm sure a spot will open up soon . 

Oh , my god ! 
 That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life ! 
 What park ? You found a doll in a park ? Gross ! 
 Well , don't blame me ! I never get a chance to watch TV . 
 It's a surprise ! 
 Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up . 
 I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . 

And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! 
 And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . 
 I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . 

Mary ? Are you still there ? 
 Did your bid win ? 
 Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? 
 Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . 
 I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ? 
 But you've been looking for that stamp for years . 
 Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck . 

How do you get along with your co-workers ? 
 Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 
 I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . 
 Don't be that negative . 
 I find it there is no meaning in living this world . 
 Really , life is so boring . 
 It can't be that bad . 
 At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . 
 I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . 
 Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . 
 Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . 
 Yes . I ’ m sorry . 
 Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . 
 But you know if he brought it or not , right ? 

I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . 
 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 

Would you go to the bookstore with me ? 
 Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ? 
 So what are you interested in ? 
 I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular . 
 Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . 
 I feel eggplants are more nutritious . 
 Oh , that's how you see it . 
 Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . 
 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . 
 Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . 
 It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . 

Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 
 That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . 
 And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . 

I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . 
 Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . 

She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! 
 Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . 
 Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . 

What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
 Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . 
 Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . 
 I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . 
 Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . 
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . 
 Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . 
 Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . 
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 
 Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 

Where will you go in your vacation ? 
 You're so industrious . 
 No , I'm not clear . 
 Don't make a fuss.The price is rising 
 This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . 
 Thank you for appreciating it . 
 How about the soup ? 
 How nice of you to say so . 
 Can you imagine she's over forty ? 
 Absolutely.She ' s a teacher of aerobics . 
 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . 
 I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . 
 You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . 
 I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . 
 Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . 
 I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . 
 No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . 
 Never mind . 
 No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other . 
 She's my wife , you know . 
 What's it ? 
 What you said gives me the creeps ! 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! 
 Thank you.You ' re partial . 
 It's nice to hear that anyway . 
 No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . 
 She will be back soon.You can wait and see . 
 I'll teach you how to keep her . 
 After you've solved this problem for me . 
 Don't worry yourself too much . 

Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . 
 Of course.No girl is more charming . 

I hear little Bob has recovered . 
 The operation was very successful . 

I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 

To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . 
 How could you manage to pass the exam ? 

I was scared stiff of giving my first performance . 
 Thank you for your kindly words . 
 I think he was locked in it . 
 What a strange guy ! 
 No , I'm scared of cats . 
 I feel they're dirty . 
 Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . 
 But I don't think much of it . 
 They say he can sum up like winking . 
 Maybe he's gifted in that . 
 I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . 
 Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! 

How much did you bid ? 
 We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! 
 What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? 

The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! 
 And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . 
 What's up , Robert ? 
 Slow down . What are you talking about ? 

But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! 
 That stamp you've been looking for is for sale . 
 Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . 
 It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
 That's true . 
 Cool ! Flashy red lines ! 
 Is it waterproof ? 
 Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? 

What's that ? 
 Is that Hello Kitty ? 
 Is it real gold ? 

Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? 
 How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . 
 Look , it's starting ! 

Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . 
 It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . 
 Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . 
 Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . 
 He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while . 
 Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . 
 What happened ? Quarrel again ? 
 Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . 
 Birds of a feather flock together . 
 would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . 
 cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? 
 sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . 
 that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . 
 you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 
 well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! 

isn't it wonderful walking here ? 
 I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us . 
 it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 
 what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 
 what's there after that ? 
 what are all they for ? 

what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . 
 don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . 
 I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! 
 how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you . 
 here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . 
 let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . 
 I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! 

Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? 
 Thanks . 
 I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago . 
 Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . 
 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
 Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 
 What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
 A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . 
 Sorry , I was delayed by something and stuck in traffic . 
 Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around . 
 Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . 
 Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . 
 Hold on . We will be successful right away . 
 You think ? 
 But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy . 

Let ’ s cross here . 
 Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . 

Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . 
 So I'd rather walk or run to work . 

Reciting texts really bores me to death . 
 Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . 
 They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher . 
 Because she's not responsible enough . 
 I don't find it very exciting . 
 I can't wait ! 
 Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . 
 That's true . 
 But to me it's really enjoyable . 
 Maybe so . 
 Young people enjoy pop songs more . 
 But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . 
 The acting of the heroine is too artificial . 

What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . 
 I don't care ! 

I must admit I'm not at all interested in math . 
 But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math . 
 Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . 
 No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it . 
 Ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you . 

Bother the flies ! 
 I don't know . Something rotten here ? 

Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . 
 It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . 
 I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . 
 Like what ? 
 It was only the cheek . 
 Oh , that is ridiculous . 
 Definitely not . 

What do you think of being a secretary ? 
 How come ? 

That guy's manner really turns me off . 
 Maybe he's abnormal . 
 Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . 

That woman is a thorough drag ! 
 She keeps spitting on the ground . 

i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do . 
 not bad , any other ideas ? 
 good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? 
 They are good , but i still need a few more . 
 Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? 
 they are all good . 
 I'm fed up with his endless talking . 
 I can't see it . 
 So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? 
 You flatter me . 
 Thank you . I have been working on it for several years . 
 It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! 

Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? 
 Then tell me what's good about it . 

I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox . 

I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? 
 That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 
 The advertised rate is based on double occupancy . 
 Are you quite sure ? 
 I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . 
 Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . 

Your search on this project has been excellent . 
 The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client . 
 I am sure they will be pleased . 
 It ’ s so cool ! 
 Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . 
 Oh , this is over my head . It ’ s too professional . 
 70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that . 
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! 
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! 
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . 
 He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! 
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . 
 I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . 

I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! 
 They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! 
 I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! 
 They both just talk about how great they are all the time . 
 They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . 
 I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . 
 Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . 
 I can't afford to move right now . 
 I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . 

Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much . 

Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . 
 What happened ? 
 What did your boss say ? 
 That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? 
 Is your boss Chinese ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? 
 Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! 
 Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! 
 It ’ s great . 
 En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . 
 Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment . 
 Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him . 
 He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . 
 Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . 
 I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . 
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . 
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . 
 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 
 Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . 

Jane , what do think about this dinner ? 

How do you like the pizza here ? 

Hurry up . Time is running out . 

Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . 

Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . 

I ran into a glass door yesterday . 

It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go . 

what a nice uniform ! 
 not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? 
 they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? 
 so are you enjoying your new job ? 
 how do you like working in sales ? 
 that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . 
 I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! 
 she's my cousin . 
 I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . 
 that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . 
 The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . 
 Don ’ t worry about it . 
 I think you just need to get more sleep . 

you're rather energetic today . What's going on ? 
 free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ? 
 not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today . 
 my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! 
 you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! 
 really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy . 
 no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T . 
 thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again ! 
 alright . See you later ! 
 yes , everything is fine . 
 didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? 
 we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . 
 we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . 
 yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . 
 we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . 
 it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . 
 I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 

wow , it that your sports car ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 what's wrong with it ? 
 when's the last time you had it serviced ? 
 I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . 
 what else is wrong with it ? 
 anything else ? 
 why don't you get it all fixed ? 
 well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! 
 let's take the bus . 
 it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
 we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . 
 if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? 
 I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
 it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . 
 thanks , that was nice of you . 

I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . 

You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . 

did you get my email ? 
 sure . 
 well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
 I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! 
 I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . 
 thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! 
 no , should I have ? 
 yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? 
 that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . 
 not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 
 I'll think about it . 
 yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? 
 nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . 
 well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? 
 is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? 

Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . 

You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . 

Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! 

I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me . 

You are freaking me out . 

It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . 
 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
 I am so sorry about that . It was just a slip of the tongue . 
 Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . 
 Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . 
 Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . 
 Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! 

Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . 
 I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? 
 But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . 
 I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . 
 Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . 
 Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . 
 I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? 
 What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! 
 For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? 
 What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? 
 Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! 
 We ’ re doomed ! 
 Really ? What ! 

Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time ! 
 Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! 
 Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . 
 Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . 
 Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
 Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! 
 See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . 
 oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . 
 the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . 
 yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . 
 anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? 
 you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . 
 i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . 
 you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . 
 seriously ? 

The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . 
 Do not worry . Today will be easier . 
 Today is Saturday . 
 Today is July 4th . 
 Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . 
 It is December 25th . 
 Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? 
 That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . 
 After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 
 How about going for swim around 10 
 Happy Independence Day ! 
 yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look . 
 yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? 
 how about this blue sweater ? 
 yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? 
 I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . 
 you have good fashion sense , Karen . 
 yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . 
 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
 my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . 
 definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . 
 is that inflation ? 
 has the government taken some measures to curb it ? 
 but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . 
 how ? 
 sounds a good idea . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 
 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
 Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect . 

Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? 
 I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . 
 I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . 
 When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . 
 I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . 
 Veronica , wait ! 
 It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
 Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . 
 Not funny . 
 Why not ? What's wrong with it ? 
 Would you like another one ? 
 Hmm ... have you got a receipt ? 
 Yes . I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . 

You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . 
 The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . 
 Then why isn't there a notice ? 
 But look at them ! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice ! 
 That is a part of chinese culture , if they think you are a lovely child , they touch your head and say , how cute you are . 
 Well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners . 
 They are just been in friendly , when you are in Roman , do as the Romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment . 
 Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy . 
 Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain , use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head , keep distance from them , why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you . 

So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! 
 What are you thinking of doing ? 
 There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit 
 Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . 
 Yes , here you go . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . 
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! 
 Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . 
 That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
 Fine . 
 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 
 So what do you think it is ? 
 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! 
 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . 
 Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . 
 I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . 
 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! 
 Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 
 You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . 
 Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . 
 Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 

Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! 
 Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! 
 Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! 
 Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! 
 Eh , so so . 
 Nah , not too flashy . 
 I guess . 
 And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! 
 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 
 And Merry Christmas ! 

Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 
 The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 
 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? 
 Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . 
 No , I forgot to buy some . 
 We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . 
 Run ! They are thirsty for more ! 
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . 
 Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? 
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . 
 Really ? 

Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! 
 What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? 
 Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . 

Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . 
 Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . 
 I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . 
 Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . 
 Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 

Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! 
 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . 
 Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! 
 They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! 

Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? 
 what's the problem ? 
 well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . 
 I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept 

Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . 
 don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . 
 well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? 
 Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . 
 maybe ... I'll think about it . 
 well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . 
 now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . 
 it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee 
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? 
 well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . 
 yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up . 
 that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 
 do you prefer brandy or ports . 
 excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 
 yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
 oh , what's that ? 
 why not ? It sounds great . 
 thanks . Cheers . 

we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? 
 oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . 
 yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? 
 why did you say so ? 
 oh , really ? 
 are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? 
 what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? 
 maybe he should really something about eating etiquette . 

I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .

 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
 well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . 
 it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift 
 I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . 
 that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . 
 Yes , a little . 
 I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning . 
 I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . 
 I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them . 
 They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . 
 You can wear more clothes . 
 What happened ? 
 That's serious . 
 So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . 
 Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . 
 Yes , and you know what ? 
 I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? 

I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! 

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . 
 His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . 
 The early bird catches the worm . 
 Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . 
 You're not the only one with a lot to do . We are all in the same boat . 
 Actually , my mother made it from scratch . 
 Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf . 
 She wears her heart on her sleeve . 
 I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis . 
 I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March . 
 My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home . 
 Well , I own a house . actually , I ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ’ vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March . 
 Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . 

You are not being a good sport about this . 
 I never cheat . 

He came to work late every day that week . Then on Friday , he didn't show up at all . 

Hurry up , get in . 
 OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! 
 Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! 
 Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! 
 Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! 
 Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . 

Morning . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright . 
 No , I didn ’ t hear about that . 
 No , I don ’ t like football . 
 She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . 
 That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! 
 It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip . 
 I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier ! 
 It ’ s fine . Jump in ! 
 Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me ! 

I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . 
 I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else . 
 Just a few Christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all ! 
 Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole ! 
 You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
 He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased . 

OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . 
 Your English is fluent . 
 How do you think of the weather today ? 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . 
 Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . 
 Yes . Are you traveling here ? 
 In America , most gas stations are like this . 
 Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . 
 Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . 

Hurry up . We're going to be late . 
 What are you doing ? 

Oh , no ! Now I'll be late . 
 Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown . 

Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? 
 You don't have to go right away . 

I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . 
 Don't worry . I can give you a lift . 

Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . 
 You must have realized somebody was here . 

You're acting weird tonight . 
 What brought this on ? 

Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! 
 Who was the director ? 

I've just been a little depressed lately . 
 Nothing really . 

Bob , what are you thinking about ? 
 When do you go ? 

It's taking you forever to do my hair . 
 You should've been done already . 
 I don't think that you're done . 
 My hair looks hideous . 
 It doesn't look good at all . 
 I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . 

I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . 
 Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? 
 Is there a good time for you to help me ? 
 How about meeting in my office ? 
 Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . 

What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? 
 Do we need to book a table in advance ? 
 What time shall we go ? 

What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? 
 Shall I give you a ride home ? 
 It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . 

How did you know ? 
 Does it happen often ? 

I am not certain , but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job . 
 I think that I might like it , but I am still thinking about it . 
 I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved . 
 I am also wondering about the pay . 
 I am thinking that might be the case . 

What's your favorite magazine ? 
 What kind of magazine is it ? 
 Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? 
 Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? 
 Oh , I think I should try to read one . 
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . 
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . 

Can you do push-ups ? 
 Really ? I think that's impossible ! 
 Yeah ! 

How was my singing ? 

Jenny , are you having a good time ? 
 I ’ m glad you are enjoying yourself . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Can I get you another glass of champagne ? 
 It ’ s my pleasure having you here . 
 Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . 
 Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ? 

Let's go eat . 

I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market . 

Should I ask Sara to the party ? 

What do you think of the new mayor ? 

When will you be able to come here ? 
 Okay , I'll have everything prepared for you when you get here . 

Michael Jackson's coming to town . 

Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Would you like to play tennis with me ? 
 Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning . 

How have you been ? 

You hurt Ben's feelings . 

Hello , Jack here . 
 I am working . I often work late on Thursdays . I am busy this week . 
 Tomorrow ? No , I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to . I'm going out of the town on business . 
 Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . 
 Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . 
 Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let's make it next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday ! 
 Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me . 

Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 Thanks for the invitation . I will ! 
 Yes . Look , it is on my desk . 
 Not at all . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Yes . It ’ s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it . 
 Thank you , Lisa . 
 Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . 
 Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you . 
 That's terrible ! 
 That sounds like fun . 
 I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . 
 Congratulations , I hope everything works out . 
 Not yet . 
 Yes , I hope we meet again . 
 Okay . 
 I want to go traveling . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . 
 Okay . 
 Calm down ! 
 So am I . 
 I've seen her on TV but not in the flesh . 

My wife gave birth to our first child today . 

My uncle passed away last night . 

I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . 
 So you can learn a lot from him . 

Why do you go fishing so often ? 

Is sailing fun ? 

How was your vacation in Paris ? 

My girlfriend dumped me . 

I'm looking forward to summer vacation . 

My uncle passed away last night . 

How's your girlfriend ? 

You were right . It's raining again . 

How much do you make a month ? 

I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ? 
 That'll be fine . Thanks . 
 I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . 
 Yes , it is . Are you here on business ? 
 I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ? 
 Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . 
 Great , let ’ s go ! 
 I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there . 
 Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . 
 It sure is . 

Tom , I've got good news for you . 
 Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ? 
 You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you . 
 You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! 
 After you . 
 You're welcome . 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 

Hi . What's up ? 
 Not too much . I've been pretty busy . 
 Gotta go . Call me tonight . 

What happened ? 

Guess what ? 

Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 I've got a date . 
 It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other . 
 Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . 
 I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . 
 It was fun , I tell you . 
 Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! 
 Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . 
 Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . 
 We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! 
 Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday . 
 Not yet . 
 In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . 
 Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone . 
 No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 
 That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . 
 Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . 
 I know , we've met . 
 Yes , we met last year at a conference . 
 I know what you mean . 
 Yes , he did the same to me . 
 What for ? 
 Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - here , in the pool . 
 Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here . 
 No . 
 You got me . 

Be quiet , Will you ? 

What food do you fancy ? 
 How about going to Joe's Restaurant . 

Hi , how is it going ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . 

What would you like for Christmas ? 
 Have you asked Santa ? 

Hi , Bob , this is Mary . 
 I work for an Internet company . 

What's wrong , Bob ? 
 Of course , I will . 

Bon voyage ! 

Let's get together this weekend . 

Happy Anniversary , honey . 
 After the trouble I got into last year , no way . 

What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 

Did you find what you were looking for ? 
 Okay , let's both look for it now . 

I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
 I'm doing great , thank you . 

Mike's really angry . 

Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? 
 Maybe we're walking in circles . 

It was great meeting you . 
 Maybe we can meet again sometime ? 

Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other . 
 I'm sorry but it's for the best . 

Time flies ! 

Will you be okay when you immigrate to America ? 
 What about your parents ? 

I must be going . 

How about going to the cinema tonight ? 
 I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . 
 Don't you think it's too bloody ? 

Nice day today , isn't it ? 
 We can't complain about the weather recently . 
 I wonder how long this weather can last . 

How's business ? 

I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . 
 No , but I'd really like to . 

I've moved . 

Hello , Mary . 
 Here is my friend Bob . 

Have you heard the news ? 

Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . 
 Bob is in advertising . 

I just got fired . 

Can you lend me your car ? 

I'm happy to see you again . 
 We should do this more often . 

You and Bob have finished ? 
 Are you going to be okay ? 

Hey , Mark , long time no see . 
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 
 They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . 
 Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . 
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 

Hello Bill , what's new ? 
 I'm glad to hear it . 

The boss is mad at you . 

Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Tom ? 
 Will you travel by sea or by air ? 
 I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves . 
 The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . 
 I work in a publishing house . How about you ? 
 What do you do then ? 

Good morning . 
 What does the paper say ? 
 Well , what ’ s the weather report ? 
 Did they find those bank robbers ? 
 What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ? 

Tom did me many favors . 

Don't be afraid . Give it a try . 

Why don't you go out with Jack ? 

I'm not a VIP . 

Paul sends you his regards . 

Thanks for your help . 
 Let me know if I can do anything for you . 

I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . 
 I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Yes , that would work out better . 
 Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . 

Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? 
 It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . 
 We will need it for both days . 
 The van will be driven by Mary and me . 
 Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . 

Peter and Mary broke up . 

The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . 
 I have chosen January as the month for this retreat . 
 Yes , maybe another choice might be better . 
 Thank you for thinking of that . 
 That is a good idea . 

I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . 
 It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it . 
 I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . 
 Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . 
 Yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . 

It's all over . I'm bankrupt . 

I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . 
 January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . 
 You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . 
 That is a good suggestion . 
 Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . 

I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend . 
 It is in the park downtown . 
 We will need it for Saturday only . 
 Mary and I will be driving the van . 
 Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? 

Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . 
 It will be at the beach by the pier . 
 We will only be needing it for Sunday . 
 The only two drivers will be Mary and I . 
 Sure . We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . Would that be OK ? 

You're spending a very long time on my hair . 
 I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . 
 Are you sure you're finished ? 
 You did a horrible job on my hair . 
 I don't like anything about it . 
 That's fine , but I'm not paying for it . 

What's new ? 

What's taking you so long ? 
 I need you to hurry up . 
 I think there's more you need to do . 
 My hair looks awful . 
 I just don't like my hair . 
 I won't be paying you for this . 

We're thinking about going to America . 
 There is that . 

Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? 
 Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? 
 I'll go myself then . 
 It's the most fun I've had in years . 
 Yes , we should . 
 Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . 
 The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . 
 Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . 
 Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . 
 The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . 

What was that all about ? 
 Is she going to be okay ? 

What day is it ? 
 I'm leaving on November 10th . 
 No , it's a Monday . 
 Right . 
 I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . 
 Yes . 
 My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . 
 If we start now , we can make it by taxi . 
 I could help you with that . 
 I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . 
 Tomorrow night would work for me . 
 OK , and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . 
 See you tomorrow night . 
 Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ? 
 I like chocolate myself . 
 I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . 
 Have you ever had garlic ice cream ? 
 It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though . 
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . 
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . 
 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 
 I would love to help you prepare for your presentation . 
 This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that . 
 I could easily give you some time tomorrow night . 
 Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? 
 Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet . 
 Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? 
 I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . 
 I don't like peppermint ice cream . 
 One time , I tried garlic ice cream . 
 That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order ! 
 Do you think that is a good idea ? 
 What are your main concerns ? 
 I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . 
 Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? 
 I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . 
 Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . 
 I'm finished . What do you think ? 
 Do you really ? 
 Well , thank you very much . 
 You owe me $ 55 . 
 You are very welcome . Come back again . 
 There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? 
 Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? 
 I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . 
 I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . 
 I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 What style do you want ? 
 Exactly how short do you want it ? 
 Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ? 
 Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . 
 All right , then let's begin . 
 I'm almost finished . 
 I'm done now . Do you like it ? 
 You really like it ? 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 It's going to be $ 55 . 
 Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks . 
 Like how ? 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? 
 That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? 
 I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . 
 Fine then . Let's get started . 
 Give me a little while longer . 
 There you go . How do you like it ? 
 You think it looks nice ? 
 Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job . 
 Just give me $ 55 . 
 No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time . 
 What were you thinking ? 
 What would you like me to do ? 
 How short ? 
 Do you really want it that short ? 
 If you really want me to , then I'll do it . 
 Let's do it . 
 Yes , thank you . I've already been helping myself . 
 I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine . 
 I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me . 
 Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon . 
 Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ? 
 I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes . 
 Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long . 

Are you satisfied with the dishes ? 
 I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . 
 If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? 
 Great , I love hot food too . 
 You said it . 
 Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . 
 Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . 
 I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . 
 I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . 
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 
 What happened with that guy at the cafe ? 
 But you ’ re crazy about him . 
 Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? 
 Hmm . ' You ’ Ve got mail . ' 
 Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
 What is it ? 
 So are you . 
 I feel exactly the same way as you . 
 What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . 
 No . 
 I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . 
 I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . 

I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 

Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
 Yeah , those classics from the great writers . 

So what kind of music turns you on ? 
 You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? 

How do you feel ? 

Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . 

Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 
 Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? 

I'm feeling hungry . 
 Yes , let's get something to eat . 

The boy threw up . 

Shall we go for a drive today ? 
 Maybe you're right . 

Susan ? What brings you here today ? 
 Really ? So what ’ s the news ? 

I'm feeling down . 

Where's Bob ? 
 Can you give him a call on his mobile ? 

I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . 

What day is it today ? 

I've just had an argument with Bob . 
 He did and it's his entire fault . 

What are you doing this weekend ? 

You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? 
 Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? 
 I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . 
 Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . 
 Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . 
 That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . 
 Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . 
 The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . 

Are you free tonight ? 

Did you hear about Bob and Mary ? 
 They had an argument and split up . 

It's getting late . 

Do you like flowers ? 
 What's your favorite flower ? 
 Peach blossom is really beautiful . 
 I like lotus . 
 But there aren't any lotus now . 
 That's not bad . Let's go . 
 Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . 
 Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . 
 But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . 
 It's December eighteenth . 
 Yes , I know that . 
 Sure , a promise is a promise . 
 I don't recall . 
 Give him a chance . 
 It's user friendly . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What teams are playing tonight ? 
 That will be a tough match , right ? 
 What are we waiting for ? It's already 7 pm now . Let's buy some drinks and desserts now . 

David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? 
 I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! 
 It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . 
 I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . 

What happened to John ? 

How old are you ? 

I don't dare ask Jane for a date . 

Why aren't you at work ? 

We're going dancing tonight . 

I can't go to your party . 

Hello , My name is Candy Brown . May I have your name ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Where are you from ? 
 I was born here . 
 It's nice talking to you . But I have to go . 
 OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then . 

Hello , Rachel . It's glad to see you here . 
 I'm going to throw a party tomorrow night . Would you like to come ? 
 Of course . 
 At 6 o'clock . 
 See you . 
 Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . 
 It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? 
 We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? 
 OK . Do you want us to bring something ? 
 OK , see you later . 

Rachel , do you like music ? 
 What kind of music do you like best ? 
 Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? 
 I got two . We can go there together . 

What are you listening now , Fred ? 
 Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to . 
 What's your comment on his new album ? 
 Let me enjoy it . 
 I cann't wait for buying his CD now . 
 Oh , no ! Not again . 
 Okay , I will . 
 Honey , a typhoon is coming . 
 Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food . 

What dances do you like ? 
 Then you must be interested in disco . 
 Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance . 
 Thank you . Now they are playing a rumba . Would you have a try ? 
 OK . Let's get something to drink . 

The music has started . 
 It's very nice . 
 Certainly . 
 Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . 
 Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs . 
 Honey , it's just windy and raining outside . 

Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? 
 The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . 
 Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? 

Thanks for everything . 

How was your date recently ? 
 I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . 
 Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . 
 Forget about it ! 
 It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . 
 It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . 
 But , well ... what I want to say is ... 
 Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . 
 She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . 

How's business ? 

How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! 
 Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . 
 That's rock and roll with fast tempo . 
 Take it easy . The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party . 
 OK , follow me . 
 May I ? 
 ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully ! 
 Depends . 
 It's hard to say . But I do love waltz very much . 
 To tell the truth , I don't like it . 
 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well . 
 OK . I'll have a try . 
 Thank you for your compliment . 

How do you like waltz ? 
 May I invite you for the first dance ? 
 In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . 
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
 Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 
 Fine . 
 I'm Amy . How do you do ? 
 Certainly ! I suppose you dance often . 
 Yes , I'm glad I have come . 
 I like it very much . 
 Thank you . It's lucky that I have got a good partner . 

How's the weather today ? 
 Is it going to rain today ? 
 But I heard it might rain . 
 I'd rather you didn't . 
 I'd love to . 
 Dress casually . 
 You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . 
 Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . 
 Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . 
 Just tell him off . 
 You're kidding ! 
 He got a scolding . 
 Let's change the subject . 
 Search me . 
 For me , the times of chatting online has gone . 
 I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . 
 Do you still remember Justin ? 
 He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . 

David , recently I established a travelling forum , and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity . Where can we go for this time ? 
 a dozen . 
 It's surely worth going to . There are ten famous spots there . 
 Inform my members to prepare for the travelling . And then we can discuss about the travelling costs . 
 Nothing doing .

 You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . 
 Certainly . 
 Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . 
 Promise ? 
 Yes , I am . What's wrong ? 
 OK . No problem . 
 But it's said that you dance wonderfully well . 
 No . Just occasionally . 
 I love rumba and waltz . 
 To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast . 
 OK . See you then . 

Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ? 

Are you tired ? 

Shall we sing with a karaoke ? 
 For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . 
 I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . 
 Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? 

I'll help you with your homework . 

I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . 

Are you going to take the job ? 

Thanks for the loan . 

B , what's in your hand ? 
 Why do you read them ? 
 I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . 
 I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . 
 Shall we have a drink someday ? 

Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ? 
 That's great ! 

Where are you going this weekend ? 
 So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? 
 Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel . 
 Your tent and enough food and water . 
 We can go fishing , chatting and camping . 
 Don't hurry . Wait for my call . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on . 
 No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ? 
 Really ? How many collections do you have ? 
 Among those collections , which is the most expensive ? 

Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't . 
 What's your meaning ? 
 You are a thief ? 
 You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ? 
 Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job . 
 Sure 
 It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it . 
 Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . 
 What are those ? 
 I'm going to take more pictures today . 

Do you like climbing ? 
 How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? 
 It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . 
 Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . 
 It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . 
 You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . 

David , imagine meeting you here ! 
 All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . 
 How many vegetables do you steal today ? 
 So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . 
 I really want to be far away from the reality now . 

Awful ! My cell phone is out of service again . Fred , can you lend me some money ? 
 200yuan . I bought a computer online , so I have to pay the mortgage . 
 It's so nice of you . You really make my day . 
 What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . 

We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? 

Rob lost his bike . 

Do you surf online regularly , Joe ? 
 Are you crazy ? What are you doing four hours online ? 
 Online chat ? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ? 
 It sounds interesting . 
 Hi , Peter . I didn't see you last night . Where did you go ? 
 Did you play network games the whole night ? 
 What are you going to do now ? 

Thanks a million . 

Jim was late again . 

Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ? 
 Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie . 
 Yes . We can do something else if you like . 
 Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ? 
 Good . I will see you then . 
 Bye . 
 What's on tonight ? 
 Who is in this movie ? 

How's John doing ? 

Why are you shivering ? 

I wouldn't dare go bungee jumping . 

Dear Anna . I really love you . 
 I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? 
 Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... 
 Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . 
 Let me wear you this diamond ring . 

Honey , I've got good news for you . 
 You are going to be a father . 
 Yes . We'll have our baby soon . 
 Me , too . 
 Just having a chat . 
 I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 Thank you , dear . I feel better now . 
 Okay . Take your time . 
 The same as usual . 
 All right . 
 Thank you . 
 Really ? 
 It is a new park , isn't it ? 
 I guessed it . 
 Oh , how wonderful ! 
 Yes and no . 
 OK . See you . 
 What about the Yellowstone National Park ? 
 Yes . The scenery is so breathtaking . 
 There are thousands of hot springs and fountains . The park is known for them . 
 Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon . 
 You can take No . 2 bus . 
 It was a piece of cake . 
 Sure . 
 In a while , crocodile . 
 What have you done ? 
 Why don't you go shopping online ? 
 Why not ? Let me recommend a website . 
 It sells almost everything you can see in the department . 

Where are you going ? 
 Why not listen to music online ? 
 You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . 
 In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . 
 Certainly . Realplayer is a good . 
 Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . 

Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? 
 I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? 
 You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? 
 It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . 

Come on in . Make yourself at home . 

Do you have a minute ? 

Bye . Take care . 

How was the party ? 

Who's your favorite singer ? 

Where's your better half ? 

We'd better leave now . 

I just got sacked . 

Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) . 

I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . 

Have a nice weekend . 

What do you do ? 

What a coincidence seeing you here . ! 

How do you like my new sports car ? 

How do you like Korea ? 
 What part of the visit excited you most ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . 
 Sometimes the traffic is too busy . 

Let's take a coffee break . 

I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? 
 Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? 
 Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? 
 No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? 
 Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? 
 No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? 

I quit my job . 

What did you say ? 

Do you like singing ? 
 Let's go to a ETV tonight . 
 It doesn't matter . No one will laugh at you . 
 What about six ? 
 OK . Let's make it . 
 Great ! 
 Do you want to bet ? 
 Sure . Come on in . 
 It's ten thirty . 
 It leaves in 20 minutes . 
 Can you pick me up from the airport ? 
 How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? 
 Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock . 
 Any idea when you'll leave ? 
 Let me know when you find out . 
 No . Have a seat . 
 We had a fantastic time . 
 No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . 
 Shandong . 
 Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? 
 Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? 
 Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? 
 Who started the modern Olympics ? 
 What did people call him ? 
 What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? 
 Well , that's for all . Excellent ! 

Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? 
 It's easy , let me help you . 

What's today's date ? 

I'm really mad at Bob . 

What's the matter ? 

What would you like to drink ? 

Would you like some more rice ? 

I'm going shopping . 
 No . I need to borrow $ 50 . 

Where are you from ? 

Can you imagine having a million dollars ? 
 Yeah , me too . 

When's your birthday ? 

Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? 
 Okay , that's good . 

What brings you to Beijing ? 

It's very cold tonight ! 
 0h , that would be nice of you . 
 Yes , please do that . 
 You can say that again . 
 My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . ) 
 I can't help it . 
 OK.Take care . 
 Is it formal or informal ? 
 In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . 
 The brown leather shoes are OK . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . 
 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 
 That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . 
 When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . 
 Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . 
 Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . 
 Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? 
 Hey , young man , you are so deep today . 

Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ? 
 I guess it ’ s formal . 
 That ’ s right . 
 You are smart . 
 You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ? 
 Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? 
 OK . 
 Don't ask me . 
 Don't shoot . I give up . 
 Sorry , I don't smoke . 
 If you gotta go , you gotta go . 
 They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . 
 Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . 
 Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . 
 Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . 
 She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . 
 You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . 
 So , want me to book the tickets again ? 
 We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend . 

What are you doing ? 

We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . 
 Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 
 Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) 
 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
 No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . 
 Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . 
 Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? 
 Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . 

I've heard that Tom is going to move . 
 Yeah , he is going to move next month . 
 He is going to Canada and to live with his son . 
 Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son . 
 Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . 
 I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? 
 I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . 
 Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . 
 I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? 
 Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . 
 Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . 
 It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . 
 She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . 
 She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . 
 I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . 
 I'm just glad it's over . 
 Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . 
 Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . 
 It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . 
 I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . 
 Certainly . I prefer the winter and I love plum blossoms much more . 
 Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground . 
 Yes . Very wonderful . 
 Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms . 

What part did you get in the play this time ? 
 I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . 
 I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . 
 Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . 

Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . 
 He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day . 
 The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . 
 My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . 
 You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . 
 Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this . 
 You can't peek ! This is a surprise . 
 Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . 
 And please shut the door and lock it behind you ! 
 We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . 
 Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . 
 Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . 
 You should be there some Christmas Eve . 
 How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . 
 Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? 
 I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? 
 If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . 
 Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? 
 Are they having a sale ? 
 That sounds great . Where should we meet ? 
 Sounds good . See you there . 
 They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? 
 This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . 
 It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? 

Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? 
 How many hours do you work each day now ? 
 That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? 
 Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? 
 Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . 
 That's true . 
 Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . 
 I'd love to try some snacks . 
 Kebabs and roast squid . 
 Help yourself . 

Could you tell me the time ? 
 What time is it , please ? 

Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . 

You saved my life yesterday , Rachel . I can't believe I forgot to bring my wallet when we went to lunch with those clients . 
 Let me buy you lunch today to pay you back . 
 Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? 
 Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? 
 I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? 
 Oh , I am from London as well . 
 In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . 
 That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . 
 First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . 
 There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 
 That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . 
 A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . 
 Sorry . How far is the museum ? 
 Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . 
 Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . 
 I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . 
 Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . 
 I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! 
 Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . 
 I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . 
 That sounds great . What time should I come over ? 
 Sounds good . See you there ! 
 Yes , I saw one . Believe me . 

Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! 
 Who taught you to put on make-up ? 
 Can you teach me how to do make-up ? 
 What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? 
 How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? 
 How did you grow such long nails ? 

What's the name of the singer who sings this song ? 
 It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' . 
 I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . 
 You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . 
 I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . 
 These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . 
 Oh , you're welcome . 
 She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday . 

Did you hear about Neil ? 
 I hear that he's quitting . 
 I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me . 
 I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . 
 Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . 
 Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . 
 Are you suggesting that anyone can be ? 
 No . How about you ? 

What's your favorite season ? 
 Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . 
 Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... 
 I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! 

This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . 
 No way . I've given you too many chances already . 
 I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! 
 Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see . 
 That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . 
 I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! 
 Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! 
 How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? 
 Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! 
 What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! 
 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 First , I worked as a servant . 
 I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . 
 This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . 
 Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! 
 Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . 
 Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . 
 Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one . 

It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . 

I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? 
 It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years . 
 Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II . 
 Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world . 
 Sure . 
 Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . 
 How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read ? 
 Does he even know how to speak English ? 
 That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me . 
 Oh , all right . Have him come over here for dinner . But you get to make dinner ! 
 What's the matter ? 
 Maybe there's something wrong with the program . 
 It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . 
 For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . 
 Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . 
 God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? 
 They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . 
 You'd better pay more attention to your health . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . 
 They could generally be divided into two categories 
 Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
 Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
 Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 
 Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . 

You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . 
 The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . 
 I'm glad you came . I hope you enjoyed it . 

Bob , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 I know your feeling . Take it easy . 
 You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon . 
 I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! 
 It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . 
 When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . 
 It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right . 
 Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . 

Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? 
 Are you from Italy , Christina ? 
 Really , I went to Munich last week . 
 Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . 
 I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . 
 I am studying languages . This year I am doing German and Italian . 

I hate this kind of weather ! 
 I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . 
 Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ? 
 We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ? 

Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? 

There's a typhoon coming . 
 That's what the weatherman said last night . 
 Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . 
 I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . 
 I got it on sale down at the department store . 
 I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . 
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 
 That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . 
 Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? 
 I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . 
 I guess that you will really be dressing down . 
 Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . 
 I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . 

What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . 

Jack's been looking unhappy lately . 
 No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . 
 Hi George ! It's good to see you ! 
 I just opened up my own business not long ago . 
 I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that . 
 Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun ! 
 I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? 
 It's white gold . 
 My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . 
 That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . 
 My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . 
 I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . 
 I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . 
 Akha . 
 I don ’ t know till now . 
 Why they hold a flour war ? 
 They are not feeling satisfied ? 
 But how guilty to waste food ! 
 What about ? 
 You have done a lot of traveling . I'll bet you've learned quite a bit . 
 Because you can see the results with the general public ? 
 I would buy that kind of book ! 
 That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! 
 That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . 
 Will it be an all day event ? 
 That was quick thinking . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . 
 In June . 
 Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . 
 Thank you so much . 
 It's a Tag Heer . 
 This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . 
 Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . 
 I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . 
 No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . 
 Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . 
 Let's try it ! 
 This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? 
 No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . 
 Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . 
 I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . 

It's really late but I'm starving . 
 Maybe they have some good pie . 
 There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . 
 Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . 

Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! 
 Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . 
 Three months . 
 I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . 
 I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . 
 I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . 
 Thank you so much . 
 I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . 
 I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . 
 So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? 
 I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . 
 What ? 
 You must be joking ! 
 No , who won ? 
 Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . 
 The one in the red shirt ? 
 She's alright . 
 Why don't you go talk to her ? 
 Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . 
 Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . 
 It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . 
 Do you want me to go talk to her ? 
 If you don't do anything , I'll bet somebody else will . 

You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! 
 Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . 
 You're serious ? 
 I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . 

Hey , Sandy . Do you want to go to the ETV with us ? 

Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? 
 He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? 
 That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . 
 He had great vision , didn't he ? 

Hey , let's arm wrestle ! 
 Chicken ! You're afraid I'll beat you . 

Hey Jack . What's going on ? 
 Really ? When did you decide this ? 
 That's exciting , man . 
 You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . 
 There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . 
 Thought about what ? 
 I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . 
 Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . 
 Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? 
 Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? 
 How Ay days will the reunion be ? 
 This is going to be a major production for you ! 
 Why do I need to do that ? 
 Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ? 
 Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere . 
 Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . 
 Sure , what's going on ? 
 Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . 
 Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? 
 Jacob Hammer . He is originally from Holland . 
 It's really a small world , isn't it ! The Hammer family isn't very big . 
 I always make time for family . 
 Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ? 
 I'm a little nervous ! 
 How Ay people will be there at dinner ? 
 That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . 
 Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . 
 Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . 
 He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . 
 He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . 
 I like baseball the best . 
 Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . 
 I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . 
 It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? 
 I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . 
 When do you guys play ? 
 Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . 
 I like baseball and basketball . 
 In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . 
 Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? 
 Are you a football player ? 
 What is two hand touch and flag football ? 
 I see . It's safer then right ? 
 I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . 
 Great . 
 I'm going out this Saturday . 
 Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . 
 We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . 
 How much does it cost over there ? 
 That's pretty good . Let's do it . 
 Make it 4 
 Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then . 
 Will do . 
 Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? 
 I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . 
 Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! 
 Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . 
 You bet . I'm really excited . 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . 
 I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . 
 Or what only we are able to give them . 
 What are the movies that are playing ? 
 I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . 
 Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? 
 Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! 
 Hello , there , my name is Tonia . 
 Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you . 
 Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them . 
 It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! 
 That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . 
 Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . 

We'd like to have a look around your house ? 
 Thank you . 
 It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? 
 Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? 
 Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? 
 Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . 
 Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? 
 That will work . 
 That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . 
 Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . 
 Probably my parents . 
 Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . 
 Your parents are not like that ? 
 You're lucky . 
 Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . 
 Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . 
 Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? 
 Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! 
 Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . 
 That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . 
 Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . 
 Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . 
 He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing . 
 She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight . 
 You don't have to . 
 Ok . Let's go right after dinner . 
 Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ? 

There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . 
 My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . 
 I can hardly wait ! 
 I'll double check the announcement . 

Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . 
 My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . 
 I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . 
 Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . 

He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know . 
 No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . 
 What is it ? 
 You big scrooge ! 
 But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . 
 Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . 
 Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . 

I'll see you in Sterlet , then . 
 Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . 

Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract . 

What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . 
 Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . 
 That is a really interesting fact . 
 Just do whatever you feel like doing . 
 Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . 

Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week . 
 How can we get there ? 
 OK ! Let's go . 
 Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan . 
 Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas . 
 It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? 
 Let's plan a surprise party for him ! 
 That's easy . Anything else ? 
 Won't he be surprised ! 
 That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! 
 Actually , a friend of a friend . 
 Alecia . 
 Thanks . They look delicious . 
 That would be great . I would love some . 
 Okay . But what is a tailgate party ? 
 How fun ! Can I bring something ? 
 I make a mean potato salad ! 
 Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you ! 
 How about next Friday ? 
 How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? 
 That's what I was thinking . 
 Do you feel like a king in your castle ? 
 It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it ! 
 That's exactly why my business is doing so well ! 
 Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients . 
 If you ever need a job , let me know . I can always train you . 
 Of course , I like . 
 Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival . 
 Yes . How about you ? 
 You have a perfect taste ! 
 But it used to be ignored by many people . 
 Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . 
 Why ? 
 I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? 
 It's not too late . Go to buy some now . 
 My girlfriend just broke up with me . 
 Yeah . 
 You've been through this too ? 
 But it hurts too much . 
 What if I don't want to find another girl ? 
 You're right . 
 Yeah . Thanks for the talk . 
 Ok . I'll talk to you later . 
 I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . 
 What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? 
 I intend to invite him to dinner . 
 I'm falling in love . 
 That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . 
 No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . 
 I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . 
 I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then . 
 She's the only thing I can think of all day long . 
 Aright . I'll talk to you later . 
 I have no idea . 
 It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots . What about your plans ? 

Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? 
 I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? 
 I'm sorry she's gone . 
 I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . 
 When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . 
 It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . 

Bill , Happy Halloween ! 
 I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . 
 I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . 

Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? 
 I'm sorry . When did this happen ? 
 What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . 
 He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . 
 It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . 
 Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . 
 How about coffee down the street ? 

Happy new year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate's having a party . 
 On the fourth Thursday of November . 
 People cook turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner . 
 Besides the turkeys , we'll also have other delicious food . Such as pumpkin pies , puddings , mashed potatoes , bread , a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables . 

How do you think about our boss ? 
 Yes , I think he's the most relaxing person in management . 
 That's good . Maybe you'll get promoted . 

Merry Christmas , Bill ! 
 What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? 
 I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party . Would you like to come ? 
 See you . 
 Who ? 
 Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too . 
 What's the movie about ? 
 Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about ? 
 Yeah , she is great . I also admire her for her concern about society . 
 The same to you , Joey . 
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 

Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ? 
 I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories . 
 I'm fond of history books . 

I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? 
 Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? 
 So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? 

Jack , what do you think about the election ? 
 How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? 
 Who do you think will be elected ? 
 I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . 

Is the lake very polluted ? 
 Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? 

Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? 
 Really ? Say it ! 
 Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . 
 Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . 

It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband . 
 Someone declared that he saw it . 
 Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover . 

I could get along fine without all the office politics . 
 There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . 
 We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . 
 Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . 

Julia , what do you think of the network ? 
 Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . 
 I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . 
 Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . 
 Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? 
 Sure . Where shall I meet you ? 
 Great . I look forward to meeting you . 
 See you . 
 I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . 
 Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . 
 But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . 

Good afternoon ! 
 Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin . 
 Is this your first time in Beijing ? 
 Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me . 

What was the movie you saw last night ? 
 Really ? I've seen that movie , too . 
 I thought it was pretty good . 
 You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . 
 It might be . 
 Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . 
 A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . 
 Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . 
 Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement . 
 I've already got plans , too . 
 How about Friday ? Only in that day can I arrange it . 
 That's settled then . I'll contact you later . 
 Is that the box-office ? 
 I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please . 
 What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ? 
 Wonderful , I'll take them . 
 Wang Min . Telephone number is 13811658 . Can I pick the tickets this afternoon ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . 
 I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company 
 It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . 
 I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . 
 Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . 
 What's it about ? 
 I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . 
 We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . 
 Where ? Oh , that's Henry . 
 He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . 
 Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . 
 Well , haven't you heard ? 
 Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . 
 According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . 
 Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . 
 Yes , nobody was with her . 
 In Thailand . 
 Yes . yes , I am sure . 
 Quite sure . I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers . 
 Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death . 
 I don't care for a detective film . It also makes me nervous . 
 No , I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful . 
 No , romance is boring . 
 Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ? 
 Certainly . Is there anything wrong ? 

Can we have two tickets for the 7:30 showing of ' Beautiful Mind ' . 
 What's on tomorrow at that time ? 
 Terrific , that's a wonderful movie , I like it very much . Can I get tickets now for tomorrow ? 
 Two tickets , please . 

Can I help you ? 
 Sure . There is a folk concert tonight . 
 Sorry . There are only some seats in the back . 
 It begins at 7 p . m .. 
 How many tickets do you want ? 
 OK . Fifty yuan for each . 

Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ? 
 What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time . 
 My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening . 
 At eight thirty . 
 OK , I'll be waiting . 
 Give them a buzz ? What can I say to them ? Say that you want a loan ? 
 And they , too , want to make sure their loan is worthwhile . 
 Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . 
 Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it . 
 What's its name ? 
 What is it about ? 
 Sounds interesting . 
 Yes , do you have tickets ? 
 Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now , shall we ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? 
 Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . 
 Number 7 and 9 of the Row 11 in the stalls , aren't they ? 
 What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people . 
 Look . It's begin . 
 It's so interesting , I like it very much . 
 Why not ? 
 Do we have enough time ? 
 The performance is excellent . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes , but it's much smaller . 
 OK . 
 It is very dull , and the production isn't very satisfactory , either . 
 To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 
 Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . 
 Me , too . I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another . 
 Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days . 
 Let me think . Oh , awful ! I still have not finished the chart which was assigned by Mr . Wharton on Friday . So that task will make my busy . 
 So what ? 
 Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . 
 I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . 
 And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . 
 Certainly . 
 Yes , it is . May I help you ? 
 What date , sir ? 
 Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ? 
 OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan . 
 All right . May I have you name , please ? 
 When would you like to collect the tickets ? 
 We can hold them until one day before the show . 
 Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation . 
 You are welcome . Goodbye . 
 I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . 
 Stop complaining , OK ? 
 No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . 

Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . 
 What are you assigned to do ? 
 For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 That's out of the question . 
 I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . 
 I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? 
 Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? 
 Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! 
 Any time . I'm just glad I could help . 
 I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music . 
 I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball . 
 I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation . 
 Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works . 
 I like all kinds as long as they are exciting . 
 Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . 

Watch out , Patrick ! 

It sure is hot today . 

Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ? 
 You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . 
 Are you all right ? 

Can you play tennis ? 
 It is interesting , isn't it ? 
 Can you teach me ? 
 Let me try . Oh , I missed ! 
 High ? 
 Oh ! I hit it . 
 Thank you . I think I like playing it . 
 Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently . 
 I heard they were just married for half a year . 
 Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock . 
 Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 

My brother joined the army last year . 
 He's tall and strong . 

I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow . 
 I always get excited the day before . 
 I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me . 
 What things make you excited ? 
 Oh ... that makes me excited too ! 

No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? 
 He won the first place ! 

Too bad you missed Jane's performance . 
 It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . 
 I don't think so . Michael . 
 Pleased to meet you , too , Shirley . So , what do you do ? 
 I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ... 
 I think Hebes is a good place . 
 Really ? 
 How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? 
 It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! 

Hey , David . Would you like some drinks ? 
 Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night . 
 For killing time and making new friends . 
 Calm down ! My little guy ! You'll get used to that after you come here several times . 
 I'd like a gin and tonic . 
 What's he like ? 
 You must feel very uneasy at his home . 
 I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . 
 Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . 
 I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . 
 Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . 
 How about a cold bottle of beer . 

Which kind of sport do you like to watch ? 
 So you must like NBA game . 
 What kind of sport do you like to participate in ? 
 I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash . 
 How about playing tennis with me ? 

Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . 
 That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! 
 Sure.thanks . 

Delicious ! Did you make this chocolate cake yourself , Fred ? 
 It's really good . 
 No.thanks . I'm full . 
 Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes . 
 Good afternoon , Tina . 
 I'm not sure yet . And you ? 
 Is skating interesting ? 
 But I can't skate well . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U . S . ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Yes , of course . 
 Kobe . 
 Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ? 

Mr . Bellow , have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions ? 
 Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients . 
 ( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow . 

Many people play sports in China , don't they ? 
 I expect all Chinese can play table tennis . 
 Do you like playing table tennis ? 
 Are indoor sports popular ? 
 Really ? I like playing basketball , too . 
 That's great . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Ted , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 What're you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you're feeling about her . 
 But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! Even though you are rejected , it's not the end of the world ! There's nothing to lose , is there ? 

Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there . 
 ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in . 
 OK . 
 I want to think about it for some time . 
 I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart . 
 I can't tell you . 
 When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want . Would you ? 
 Don't be so happy , it is just one of my tests ! 
 I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble . 
 No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? 
 That's exactly where I was planning to go ! 

This is tough to say , John , but I think we should break up . 
 Yes , I mean it . 
 No , we are just too different . This relationship isn't going anywhere . 
 I have thought about it for a long time . I think it's time to move on for both of us . 
 I'm sorry . 
 Then why didn't you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends . 
 I think we'll be better off if we are apart . 
 Sure , let's just be friends . 
 Not very well . 
 Nothing . 
 Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . 
 Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . 
 Maybe you're right . 
 Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... 
 I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . 
 I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . 
 She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well . 
 I really appreciate your help . 

Where are you from ? 
 Where in China is Guangzhou ? 

How is everything going with your girlfriend ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ? 
 Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? 
 What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? 
 I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! 
 I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? 
 So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea ! 
 Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . 
 They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? 
 Does that mean work isn't that great ? 
 But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun . 
 I hope you're right . 
 Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ? 
 Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year . 
 Nothing planned . How about you ? 
 I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . 
 But we have to work tomorrow . 
 I hear ya . Let's do it . 
 You're welcome , Bob . It was nice meeting you . 

Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 

It's almost 6:00 . I'd better be going . 
 It's really nice of you . Thanks ! 
 Yes , summer is coming . 
 I'd like to go to Tianjin . 
 Yes , of course . And what's your plan ? 
 That's great . 
 What ? 
 Too bad I missed it . 
 Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . 
 I still think nobody plays for nothing . 
 I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? 
 I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . 
 I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . 

A beautiful center ! 
 A goal ! 
 It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous . 

I hope the host team loses . 
 According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . 

What do you think of the former champ ? 
 No champion can remain at the top for ever . 

What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ? 
 Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole . 

Steve , when are you going back to America ? 
 Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you . 
 Not at all , Sam . 

I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle . 
 Well , say hello to him for me . 
 Really ? I didn't realize it was so late . 

Are you still at that work ? 
 What sort of job do you have in mind ? 
 But it's very tired . 
 What's your parents ' opinion ? 

What do you do now ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What's your plan now ? 
 Best wishes for you . 

I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 

Can you tell which team seems to win ? 
 Yes . Our guest team is really tough . 

We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States . 

OK , Hello ! 
 Hi , what's your name ? 
 Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ? 
 Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ? 

What's the score ? 
 The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . 

Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? 
 Japanese teams always play a dark horse . 

The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . 
 If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . 

In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? 
 Is this your best score ? 

I think he deserved his gold . 
 Yes , it's perfect ! 

Hey Mike . What are you doing ? 
 I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . 
 That sucks . He must feel depressed . 
 Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . 
 Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . 

Which team won ? 
 What was the score ? 

It's quiet everywhere in winter . 
 Me too . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . 
 Yes . Very wonderful . 
 How lovely it is ! 
 But the ref didn't whistle . 
 Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold . 
 Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . 
 Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . 
 My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . 
 Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . 
 And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . 
 Neither . The game ended in two all . 
 But the Brazilian is tougher . 
 How old is he ? 

In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . 
 Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . 
 I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . 
 And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! 
 Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . 

What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ? 
 But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 
 I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best . 
 No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it . 
 OK , that'd be very nice . 
 Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . 
 Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . 
 There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 

What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 What kind of dance do you like ? 
 Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me . 
 OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? 
 I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn . 

Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 That's what friends are for . 
 I like taking photos . 
 Yes , look at the photos I took . 
 Thank you for saying so . 

Hey Mark . What are you doing ? 
 Anything interesting on ? 
 So I take it you're pretty bored too . 
 It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? 
 I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . 
 She's out shopping with her friends . 
 Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? 
 Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes . 

What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? 
 We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . 

My friend Jean is very beautiful . 
 Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . 
 Dark blue . 
 Hi , Joe . 
 It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early . 
 It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning . 
 I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . 
 Me too . How's the weather where you are ? 

Hello ! 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . 
 Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? 
 No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? 
 I am an accountant at a company . 
 It's nice meeting you too , Alice . 
 Goodbye , Alice . 
 It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain . 
 Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ? 
 Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit . 
 He prefers suits to jackets . 
 As a matter of fact , he is . 
 Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? 
 There's nothing to watch right now . 
 Me too . Let's get together and do something . 
 Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . 
 I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . 
 Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? 
 Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . 
 It starts at one PM . 
 Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . 
 I'm doing great . 
 I saw Forrest Gump the other day . 
 The movie type is drama . 
 I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . 
 I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . 
 My favorite is to play computer games . 
 My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . 
 Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week . 
 I am going to go to the bookstore . 
 That sounds like fun . 
 Ok . See you later . 
 Yeah . What's going on ? 
 Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . 
 I just started working out . 
 I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . 
 I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . 
 It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . 
 Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . 
 I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? 
 Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . 
 Ok . Bye . 
 They have moved to Chicago . 
 Mr.Smith has changed his job . 
 Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . 
 Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . 
 Well , thank you for coming . 
 Bye . 
 What kind of business do you do ? 
 What kind of clients do you prefer ? 
 I used to work for a shipping company for six years , and I am quite familiar with some managers . Would your like to meet them ? 
 Yeah , what ’ s up ? 
 Wow . I'd love to . 
 When and where ? 
 Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation . 
 See you . 
 Certainly . 
 Several years ago . 
 Hum , I think there's enough for one more , yes . 
 Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene . 
 I'm in computing . I work for Macrohard . 
 What do you do ? 

Who's that tall guy over there ? 
 What's he like normally ? 
 Really ? What kind of problems ? 
 Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . 
 Well , he doesn't look very honest . 
 Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . 
 Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? 
 Vodka martini ? 
 I'll be back in a sec . 

Who's that striking woman over there ? 
 Really ? Why not ? She looks great . 
 Really ? Tell me more . 
 Wow , crikey . So what happened ? 
 Wow . 
 I have no idea what you're talking about . 
 Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call 

How's it going ? 
 To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 Sure , but how ? 
 But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 Easier said than done . 
 But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 

Welcome , Li Mei . Please give me your coat and hat . 
 Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself . 
 Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 
 It's a secret . 
 Yes . I like gardening . 
 Yes , follow me . Here it is . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I do . 
 I don't . I like the work . 
 Why ? What's eating her ? 
 I don't have the slightest idea . 
 What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ? 
 No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl . 
 And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . 

It is so quiet here . I like the place . 
 I can't stand the loud noise in the city . 
 I hope I can stay here longer . 
 The day after tomorrow . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Perhaps because of the dirty air . 
 Some poisonous gas . 
 Yes . I think I won't come here again next time . 
 We waste a vacation . 

How are your wedding plans going ? 
 Are you going to get married in the church ? 
 Have you booked the hotel for the reception ? 
 No problem . 
 Bill and Betty have already grown up . 
 Look at that big tree over there . 
 Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ? 
 But you agreed to go out with me at last . 
 So do you feel happy now ? 
 Of course , we are the happiest family in the world . 
 No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . 

What's your favorite sport ? 
 Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics . 
 Take your pick , Julie . 
 OK . What time ? 
 It's 60 yuan , please . 
 Sure . That'll be 40 yuan , please . 

I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . 
 How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . 

Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . 
 After you . 
 Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well . 

Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ? 
 How do you spend your spare time ? 
 What kind of books are you interested in ? 
 Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ? 

Is that your phone ? 
 It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 
 No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 

I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ? 
 What part of the film do you like best ? 
 I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . 
 It has got this year's Oscar Award . 

Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ? 
 Oh . What about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 
 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 
 Yes ! Yes ! I want to take you to dinner . 

Are you going out , Jack ? 

Hi , Jason ! 
 With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ? 
 What is on the program ? 
 Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together ! 
 See you then . 
 Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . 
 Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 . 
 That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever . 
 Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl . 
 She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now . 
 I'm just glad there were no complications . 
 It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well . 
 Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate . 
 That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time . 
 I thought you were going to let it grow out long . 
 You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you . 
 Have you thought about wearing a hat ? 
 Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! 
 Ah ? Really ? That stinks ! 
 Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . 

I want to take Shield on a date but I don't have much money . 
 She likes to golf , dance , and eat foreign food . 
 Well , I really like being with her . 
 Dutch , where's that ? 
 Oh . I wonder if she'll go for that . 
 I like playing chess . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Oh , yes . I like playing basketball . 
 Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . 
 I really like the straight legs . 
 I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . 
 What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? 
 If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! 
 What is a sixties party ? 
 That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? 
 Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? 
 Don't tell me you have a record player ! 
 Mine are wet , too . 
 She wished good luck to you . 
 Yes . 
 What for ? 
 Oh . I've really forgotten it . 
 A silk scarf . I love it . Thank you very much . My lovely son . 

Did you pass the test ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Oh , I see.Thank you . 
 Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . 

Why are those people crying ? 
 Tomb Sweeping Day ? What is it ? 
 What do they do ? 

This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . 

I want to buy a gift for my father . Will you go with me to choose one for him ? 
 Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day . 
 You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ? 

Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ? 
 Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ? 
 How do you celebrate it ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 What a surprise ! This is the best present I've ever received . 
 I love you , too . 
 Actually , I prefer to eat at home , and then we'll have more time to have a chat . 

I want to have Mexican food for dinner . 
 OK , you win . You pick the restaurant this time . 
 No , I don't mind in the least . I want to do something of my own . What about you ? 

I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China . 
 Why are you celebrating this festival ? 
 What do you do on that day ? 
 I see . 
 Sure . 
 It's very exciting . I think . 
 Certainly I do . 
 I'd be happy to do something new . 
 No problem , but you've got to be careful . 
 Here's the key then . 
 Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year . 
 Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year . 
 Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food . 
 Surely , I do . It's hard to come by , isn't it ? 
 Can you get it ? 

Hey , May , how are you doing ? 
 Why is that ? 
 But you ’ re in China . Are you planning on going home for Christmas ? 
 Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier . 
 I've got it . I won ’ t bother you any more . You ’ d better hurry to do it , Christmas is just around the corner . 

I want to leave the motorbike outdoors . 
 Why not ? 

I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike . 
 Well , I wish you good luck ! 
 That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . 
 Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . 
 It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon 

What's wrong , Frank ? 
 Cheer up ! It's not the end of the world . 
 Get a hold of yourself , Bruce . You'll get over her eventually . 
 During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips . 
 Yes , it helps me to relax . 
 I like to paint .  
 Mainly seascapes . 
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . I was in the climbing club all through school . 
 Just taking a smoke break . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 I didn't know you smoked . 
 Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . 
 Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . 
 I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit . 
 No problem . I'll talk to you later . 
 No , I rarely smoke . I don't drink , either . I only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends . 
 My favorite winter sport is skiing . In addition , I am keen on basketball . 
 I like doing aerobics in my spare time . It's good for my health . 
 Yes , I have . I collect stamps , Chinese stamps as well as those from other countries . 
 Happy New Year , Steven . 
 My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting . What about you ? 

Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . 
 Yes , it deserves its name . 
 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 
 It's interesting and I want to buy one home . 
 Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . 
 Yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face . 
 You like it , but it's getting to be a handicap for you . 
 I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too . 
 Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too ? 
 I don't think so . There's too much competition . 
 I have no idea . To be honest , I couldn't care less . 
 Come on , Brenda ! Never say die . 
 I don't know about that . 
 I'm on your side . It needs to be done over . 
 Are you sure ? He doesn't look that old . 

The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . 
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 
 I am so happy for them . 
 Yes , I always cry at weddings . 
 Yes , they are . 
 In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . 
 No , no , for the engagement . 

Good morning , Miss Wu ! Can I ask you something ? 
 Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . We both love spicy Chinese dishes . I am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where I can find some good spicy dishes . 
 How far is it from here ? 
 Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . The same to you . 
 Nothing special . 
 I'd like to . See you then . 
 Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . 
 Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . 

Hello , Anna speaking ! 
 Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? 
 I am fine . What have you been doing ? 
 That's great , congratulations ! 
 That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you . 
 How long have you been working there ? 
 How do you like your new boss ? 
 Much better than the last one , huh ? 
 Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk . 
 8 it is . See you then . 

Happy birthday , Ann . Many happy returns of the day ! Here is a present for you . 
 Ok , who is that girl ? 
 Well , I don't know . 
 Who is afraid ? I am not afraid . 
 You mean with my performance ? 
 I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . 
 I was part of a band in school . 
 Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ? 
 We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? 
 Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . 
 Wow . We don't get to see this in the city ! 
 Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink ! 
 Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! 
 Yeah , what's up ? 

What do you think of this suit ? Do I look good or what ? 
 Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ? 
 In that case , let me make a quick change into my street clothes . 
 Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz ! 

Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? 
 Was it your first time ? 
 I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . 
 It's only like that the first couple of times . 
 You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . 

Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? 
 He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . 
 Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . 
 No , she left him last year . 
 Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? 
 Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . 
 Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story 
 Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . 
 Yes , I know . 
 Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . 
 Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it . 
 Hi Martha . Everything is perfect . 
 It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much . 
 I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends . 
 In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe . 

You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 

Good afternoon , Johnson . 
 Not bad , thanks . 
 No , what ? 
 Oh , no . What kind of trouble ? 

Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here ! 
 How have you been ? 
 Pretty good . What brings you here ? 

Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Not bad . What did you do ? 
 I wasn't feeling too well , so I stayed at home . 
 OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ? 
 Are you well paid ? 
 Not bad . 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . 
 That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . 
 Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . 
 Be a yes-man , you mean ? 
 I hope not . 
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 
 Right . 
 Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . 
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . 

Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! 
 I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 
 I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . 
 Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? 
 About 80 million dollars . 

Are you busy next Saturday ? 
 I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get . Will you come shopping with me ? 
 One of the girls in my office . 
 There is no specie occasion . She just likes to organize parties from time to time . This time it is a country theme . 
 Well where am I going to get that sort of costume ? 
 Oh good . 

Hello , Janet . 
 And what is this ? 
 And when is your son's birthday ? 
 But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . 
 Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . 

So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ? 
 Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? 

I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? 
 Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . 
 Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? 
 I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . 
 Thank you . 
 How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . 
 No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? 

I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . 
 Isn't there anything less expensive ? 

What do you think about violence in movies ? 
 But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? 

I plan to emigrate to Canada . 
 No . But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good . 
 Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job . 
 The balcony is still available . 
 No , I'm afraid that's it . 
 Hi Tina , It's Joe . 
 How's the weather there today ? 
 What's the temperature ? 
 Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? 
 I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . 
 It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . 
 I still have five seats in the mezzanine . 
 No . Nothing . I'm sorry . 
 What brand ? 
 Soda or water ? 
 All right . Please wait for a minute . 
 I like to go to the movies . What do you do in your free time ? 
 Well that's great ! It's nice that we have something in common . 
 I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie . 
 I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater . 
 I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it . 
 Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ... 
 Oh really ... well you must be very popular on the Internet . But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home . 
 Hi Vicky . 
 Yes . 
 That's no problem . I just wanted to tell you I'm inside . 
 On the second floor . 
 Come upstairs . 
 Oh , Can you hear me OK ? I said , come to the second floor . 
 Just looking at some books on how to learn English . 
 No , I'm still full from dinner . 
 I don't know for sure . When you get here we'll talk about it . 
 Bye . 
 I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion . 
 Well , I'll try gin and tonic . 
 Bourbon , please . 
 With iced water , please . 
 Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? 
 That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change . 

When do you usually go to the movies ? 
 The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . 

I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ? 
 You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh . 

Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . 
 What's that ? 
 You mean ... like on a second date ? 
 No way ! That sounds great ! 
 Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . 
 To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 It is very common in the winter in Ottawa . 

The winter in Ottawa is freezing . 
 I think I will be adapted to it . 
 Yes , that's the reason why I remain here . 
 Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ? 
 I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ? 
 OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ? 
 What's your number ? 
 OK , I'll talk to you soon . 

There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . 
 Well , why not use buses or the MET ? 
 Why not ? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . 

What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? 
 I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . 
 Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how it goes . 
 The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . 
 If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me . 

The Canada Day is on the 1st of July . 
 The national anthem of Canada is ' O Canada ' . 
 Yes , I could sing it when I was very young . 
 What do you do ? 

I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . 
 How about the new bar across road ? 
 I agree , I had lunch there last week . 

Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ? 
 That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them . 
 Evening . 
 Stalls . 

Is there anything available for tonight ? 
 Isn't there anything else available ? 

Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? 
 I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper . 
 Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything . 
 Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite . 
 Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever . 

You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? 
 Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . 
 Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . 
 That would be fine . Where are you going ? 
 Great . 
 Ok . I like fishing very much . 
 It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week . 
 Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ? 
 Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ? 

Will we drive to the seaside ? 
 Let me help pay for gas . 
 What other expenses will we have ? 

Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ? 
 I know ! I don't get them at all . But wait , isn't ' Terminator ' a sci-fi movie ? 

Good morning , you look very tired . 
 Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? 
 I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . 
 Do you have much time watching TV ? 
 I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . 

What did you do over the weekend ? 
 Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? 
 Like what ? 
 What else can we do to protect the environment ? 
 How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? 
 What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? 
 I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! 

Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! 
 Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . 
 Me too . 
 Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? 
 He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . 

The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
 On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . 
 I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . 
 It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
 They're related to one another , yes . 
 People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . 
 I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . 
 Hi Angela , it's Dan . 
 Good . 
 Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . 
 Oh , is that next week ? 
 No , of course not . I already bought them a present . 
 Sure . Does she know your friend ? 
 Are we all going to drive together ? 

I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? 
 Certainly , where will you be coming from ? 
 Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . 
 Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . 
 No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . 
 That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . 
 Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? 

Craig , what do you do for work ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 That's a good school . What do you study ? 
 How long have you been studying English ? 
 That's a long time . 
 No wonder your English is so good . 
 I see . Talking with other people is very important . 
 I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come . 

Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? 
 Why ? 
 What for ? 
 That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? 
 Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . 
 Please go ahead , I am listening . 
 Is your back door higher than the ground level ? 
 Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . 
 Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . 
 Cedar is a good choice . 

What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ? 
 I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar . 
 Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! 
 Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . 
 Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move . 
 Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . ) 
 Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends . 
 Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ? 
 OK . Let me help you to hold the drink . 

Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ? 
 Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work . 
 Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good . 
 You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . 
 Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? 
 At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . 

Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? 
 I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . 
 Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? 
 Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . 
 I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' 
 Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level . 
 Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . 
 Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . 
 Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . 
 Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . 
 Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . 
 That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . 
 I am reading . 
 No , not yet . But I like to see what is available . 
 Of course , have a seat . 
 Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . 
 Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . 
 Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . 
 Oh , yes . You ? 
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ? 
 Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan . 
 Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ? 
 Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ? 
 Yes ! 
 Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . 
 Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . 
 His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . 
 No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . 
 Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . 
 My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . 
 I am going to attend an interview . 
 My major is English . Of course I'll apply for an English teacher . 
 Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now . 
 Then what should I do ? 

Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? 
 Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . 
 It was always very busy there . 
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . 
 Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . 
 No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . 
 I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company . 
 Mostly office work - filing and so on . 
 Till the end of the month . 
 Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . 
 Eighteen . 
 She ’ s not quite twenty-five . 
 Yes . 
 No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly . 
 Once a week . 
 Nothing really . 
 What's on these days ? 
 That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that . 
 How about at the subway entrance . 

What type of movies do you like ? 
 That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? 
 Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining . 
 Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that . 
 Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday . 
 The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five . 
 How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards . 

Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 

Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ? 
 Is uncle Bill your brother ? 
 So his two daughters are my cousins ? 
 What are step-sisters ? 
 So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother . Right ? 
 And when are they coming to visit us ? 

Did you see Ally Mabel last night ? 
 Yes , wasn't it funny ? 
 Ha , yes , brilliant ! 
 Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . 
 Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . 
 The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . 
 Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... 
 In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . 
 I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . 
 Yes , we do . I think we have the same musical tastes . 
 I'm not a very good singer , but I'm a really great dancer ! I love hip hop dancing . 

How did you get into hip hop ? 
 Who is your favorite hip hop artist ? 

Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? 
 Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? 

So Beth , what kind of music do you listen to ? 
 I mostly listen to pop music , but I like a lot of different stuff . 

What are the pop groups that you like ? 
 I agree ! I cried for a week when they broke up . 

What about you , Ernie ? How did you get into pop music ? 
 Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good . 

How did you meet your girlfriend ? 
 That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? 

Do you remember John from head office ? 
 Have you heard what happened to him ? 
 He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car . 
 Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . 
 In Taichung , I think . 
 Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car . 
 Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . 
 Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? 
 Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . 
 I'll say . 
 I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ? 
 Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , " Ice Ice Baby , " but I don't know his other songs . 

That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ? 
 OK , I'm going to get iTunes and download some Vanilla Ice songs . 

How did you first meet ? 
 Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? 

When did you and Amanda meet each other ? 
 So you met her right after you got to school ? 

So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ? 
 Did he tell you what she was like first ? 

What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ? 
 That's too bad . What happened ? 

I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . 
 Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . 
 Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . 
 Well , I actually thumbed a lift . 
 Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . 
 Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . 
 Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . 
 Seems like it . 
 I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . 
 That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . 
 Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . 
 In the coming , before going to work . 
 OK . I'll turn it on . 
 Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . 

Do you want to hear a funny joke ? 
 Well , you'll see . 
 OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . 
 So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . 
 Hang on , I haven't finished yet . 
 Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . 
 Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? 

Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 
 Wow ! What a hit ! 
 Is he ok ? 
 I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . 
 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 

Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? 
 What position do you play ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . 
 The Rockets . 
 All right , see you later . 
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 
 O . K . See you . 
 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 
 I like to play the piano for fun . 
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 

Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 

Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . 
 Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
 Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . 
 Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? 
 Well , I'm glad to hear that . Please give my regards to him . 

Who are those guys ? 
 Oh . 
 All right ! 
 Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . 
 Which team do you think will win ? 

Do you have girlfriend ? 
 Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . 
 So I think I may fall in love with her . 
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? 
 That's what I do . 
 Yes . 
 That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . 
 Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . 
 Yeah , falling in love is so good . 
 Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . 
 Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . 
 Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? 
 All right . See you tomorrow night . 
 Not bad . But too hot for me today . 
 Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? 
 Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? 
 No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . 
 Me too . So , do you like the course ? 
 Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . 
 Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . 
 Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! 
 Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . 
 Yup . 
 What ? 
 Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . 
 Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . 
 I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . 
 Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . 
 Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . 

William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? 
 It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? 
 Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . 
 Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . 
 Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? 
 That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? 
 I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? 
 That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . 
 Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Then your salary must be high . 
 Is this time one of them ? 
 Really ? We have only one chance every year . 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 Why ? 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? 
 Why don't you give them a suggestion ? 

It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? 
 Time sure flies , doesn't it ? 
 Me too . I'll talk to you later . 

Are you travelling in America ? 
 What do you do ? 
 I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted . 
 I am a reporter at a TV station . 
 Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . 
 I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . 
 Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . 
 That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . 
 It sure is . 

What are you up to tonight , Steve ? 
 That sounds like fun . Have a good time . 
 How about 6:30 ? 

Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ? 
 How about Legally Blonde . 
 Isn't that a scary movie ? 
 Ok . I'll give it a try . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? 
 Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ? 
 Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them . 
 About two years . And you ? Are you based here ? 

Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ? 
 I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ? 
 That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . 
 I think I will . Thanks for the info . 
 Well , I have the day off from work . 
 Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . 
 Sure . Any time . 
 Oh , yes ? 
 Mmm . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . 

Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ? 
 Yes . What did you think of it ? 
 I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant . 
 Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? 
 Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together . 
 Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . 
 We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . 
 Where would you like to sit ? 
 Certainly . 
 Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? 
 Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? 
 Wow , that's really old . 
 Why don't you get a new one ? 
 Really , what makes you say that ? 
 Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . 
 Three . Two boys and a girl . 
 What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . 
 Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . 
 What were the odds ? 
 Too bad . 
 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 
 I like to play the piano for fun . 
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 

Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? 
 Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . 
 Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! 
 He's not doing too well . 
 About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . 
 Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . 
 That's what my father tells me almost everyday . 
 Thanks . I'll let him know . 
 Oh , how could it be ? 
 OK . Wait a minute . 
 Yes . It's really snowing . 
 But don't you think it's a little too cold ? 
 You are so interesting . 
 Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . 
 I'm going to put on more clothes , too . 
 I don't know . Do you like snowing ? 
 You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . 

Henry , I want to ask you something . 
 You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . 

Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . 
 I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow . 
 It has been a pleasure . Goodbye . 

The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long . 
 Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ? 
 How long does the rainy season last ? 
 I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much . 
 But I prefer warm weather . 
 I hope so . 
 I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . 
 Something like listening to music is a good idea . 
 Classic . Something that could calm your mind . 
 Working out is another good way to relieve anger . 
 Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . 
 So soon . It seems as if you just got here . 
 It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . 
 It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine . 
 Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring . 

What day is today ? 
 What's the date today ? 
 Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? 

Hello , Jane ! 
 Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . 
 Not bad . How about you , John ? 

Life's so boring . 
 What do you think will make you happy ? 
 You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . 
 You'll get bored eventually . 
 That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . 

Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there ! 
 No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ? 
 OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . 

Hi ! Peter . How are you ? 
 Pretty good . 
 Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? 
 Not bad . But she's as busy as before . 
 I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . 
 I don't think I performed well . 
 Can you tell me how to improve myself ? 
 Thank you for your encouragement . 

How old are you , Su ? 
 I see , you have seven candles on the cake . 
 We will have a party here , right ? 

Rachel has decided to quit smoking . 
 You never guess she is going to have a baby . 
 Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby . 

Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? 
 Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? 
 But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . 

Have you got any hobbies ? 
 Which is easier to learn ? 

Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . 
 That would be a definite bonus . 
 How can we do that ? 
 No . 
 That sounds great . Thanks . 
 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Hop in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ? 
 Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . 
 We are on the high way . Find the pound shade .. 
 It's a great feeling . 
 Thanks , Daisy . 
 Perfect . Couldn't be better . 
 Of course you can . ( Lead Carl to his garage . ) 
 My car is simply a daisy . It drives smoothly . 
 I am glad to hear that . I'm really pleased with it . 

How are your wedding plans going ? 
 When will your wedding take place ? 
 It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? 
 You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . 
 Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 
 It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I think you made the right decision . 
 Yes . She believes everything about him . 
 Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . 
 I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . 
 Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . 
 I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? 
 Let's go . 
 Hi , An . How are you ? 
 I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . 
 Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty . 
 I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? 
 Oh , my . What did you do ? 
 Did you call the police ? 

Which university did you graduate from ? 
 When did you graduate ? 

Yesterday was April the first . 
 Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . 
 Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . 
 Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day . 
 What ? Won't you have more drinks ? 
 Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay . 
 Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free . 
 You , too . 
 It's my favorite . 
 The same to you ! 
 I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? 

Happy Valentine's Day ! 
 Could I treat you to dinner tonight ? 

We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival . 
 It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . 
 OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . 
 In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body . 

What is your hobby ? 
 What kind of reading materials do you like best ? 

How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? 
 But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 

Any plans tonight ? 
 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 Just did my best . 
 Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . 
 Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . 
 They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . 
 Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . 
 This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . 
 Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . 
 Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . 
 With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . 

Have you bought another handset 
 This is silver gray , while I remember your handset was black . 
 Can a handset case be changed ? 
 How many cases are accessible ? 
 It's really going to be fresh all the time . 
 I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . 
 I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . 

Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . 
 Can short messages reach them ? 
 Why haven't I thought of this skill ? 
 I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? 

Whose handset sounds so beautiful 
 Are you able to compose music ? 
 Who composed it for your ? 
 Can I get on line to search one , too ? 
 What about my SIEMENS ? 

How do you like this dress ? 
 Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? 
 People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . 
 Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . 
 It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! 
 We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . 

It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . 
 Cool ! What brand 
 What about the quality ? 

I guess I'd better go now . 
 In that case , I'll be seeing you . 

Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ? 
 Well , I think I like it . I appreciate the snow very much . 
 By the way , where can I go ski ? 

Good afternoon , Mrs . Brown . I've come to see Mr . Brown . 
 Is he in ? 
 Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat . 
 No , thank you . Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . 
 That's pretty advanced . 
 Is that where you park ? 
 Thank you . Where is your key ? 
 That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . 
 Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . 
 Here it is , and here we are . 
 I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . 
 We're sorry you have to leave . 
 Certainly . Come back soon . 
 Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . 
 I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . 

Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . 
 Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? 
 No problem . See you ! 

Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . 
 So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . 
 Is it official ? 

Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? 
 How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . 
 ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . 
 Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . 
 Ah . The Royal , I think . 
 Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . 
 Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? 
 Then , there's a 9:30 show . 
 All right . 
 Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf . 
 Of course , I like it very much . Thank you . 
 Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? 
 Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year . 
 What are the children doing ? 
 I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year . 
 Who will get the money ? 

We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . 
 Now let's get things ready . 
 That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . 
 Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . 
 It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . 
 This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . 
 Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! 
 The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? 
 As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . 
 How can I forget my old friend ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Really ? He is so great . 
 Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays . 

What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? 
 When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? 
 There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? 
 There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? 
 You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . 

Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? 
 Where do they go ? 
 They go to the home of the bride ? 
 The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . 
 That's very expensive for the family of the bride . 
 Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? 
 Maybe I'll be the one . 
 Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? 
 Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? 
 Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? 
 One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? 
 But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . 
 I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . 

Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? 
 What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? 
 That's fine . I want 2 tickets . 
 You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . 
 It's once in blue moon . 
 The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . 
 Sure . How do you like your seats ? 
 Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 . 
 That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . 
 No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . 
 Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . 
 You're welcome . 
 No , I don't . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 Oh , do you ? Good . 
 What's Net Love ? 
 Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex ! 
 How could you know ? 
 Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca ! 
 Impossible ! 
 Yes . I found a very good job down here . 
 I am going to miss you , too . 
 OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there . 
 Really ? That's nice . 
 I've been completely out of touch with my old friends . 
 Yes , people just seem to drift apart . 
 I know that . 
 Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... 
 Look , I am playing the piano for you . 
 Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . 
 Ha ! She is too little . 
 I want to tell you that I like you 
 Thx . 
 Yes , I had a bf before . 
 We parted from each other last month . 
 Mmmm , no . How about you ? 
 Haha , so you are my E-bf . 
 Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . 
 Hey ! What is it ? 
 LL 
 I have no champagne right now . How about this ? 
 Is it made of chocolate ? 
 Oh , I will have a sweet dream . 
 A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . 
 Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss . 

Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? 
 There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? 
 Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? 
 Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet 
 Do you have any successful stories to share ? 

How long have you been living in New York ? 
 Where do your parents live ? 
 Do you write or call them very much ? 

Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . 
 She sure knows how to strut her stuff . 
 And look out she's dressed . 
 No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . 
 I think you've lost it . 
 I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . 
 At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . 
 I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . 
 I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . 
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . 
 Yeah , a number of times . 
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . 
 You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . 
 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 
 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
 I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . 
 Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . 
 Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class . 
 What news ? 
 You know what we will get ? 
 What docking station ? 
 Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . 
 I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . 
 I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend . 
 Thanks . That would be really helpful . 

Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day . 
 Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop . 
 I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . 
 Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . 
 You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . 
 Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ? 
 Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . 
 No , not yet . Why ? 
 Oh . I am not his fan . 
 Hi , Bill , this is my new car . 
 You like it , huh ? 
 It is special , isn't it ? 
 Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . 
 Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 I am Chinese by birth . 
 My domicile place is Hebes Province . 
 I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . 
 In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . 
 This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . 
 Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . 
 I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . 
 I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . 
 I live in the southern part of this city . I rent a house . 
 No , I don't . 
 My family is not big , there are only 3 of us-my parents and I . 
 My father supports the family , and he is the sole breadwinner . My mother is a housewife . 
 Yes , we live a happy life together . 
 Do you have to pay to join ? 
 Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ? 
 How was your game today ? 
 Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ? 
 My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps . 

Do you have any siblings ? 
 How do you get along with them ? 

I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . 
 Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... 
 No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . 

Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you . 

Happy New Year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate's having a party . 
 Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . 
 They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . 
 They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . 
 Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . 
 We're going to visit my sister in the city . 
 About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . 
 Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . 
 I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . 
 Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . 
 I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . 
 See you later . 
 I didn't know about it . What did you do ? 
 You were really lucky . 
 I hope I can go to your party . 
 OK , which car do you want me to put them in ? 
 Which one is hers ? 
 What should I take first ? 
 Don't worry , I won't drop it . Wow , it's really heavy . I don't think I can move it by myself . 
 Where are you taking all this stuff ? 
 You're moving now ? I knew you were moving , but I thought you said you were moving next month . 

What's your name ? 
 How are you , Sam ? 
 Where are you from , Sam ? 
 What is your job ? 

Hello , Steven . Congratulations ! 
 How's your married life ? 
 That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . 

I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . 
 A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . 
 Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . 

You are quite busy every day . 
 So you have to work all day . 
 I see you sometimes work on weekends , too . 

Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? 
 Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box . 
 Have a guess . 
 No . 
 Open it now . 
 You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future . 
 I think so . Why did you ask that ? 
 Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? 
 In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . 
 Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . 

Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . 
 I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? 
 I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . 
 I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . 
 Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . 
 I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? 
 I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . 
 I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . 

Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 I am glad you like it . 
 What's the matter ? 
 How could you cheat on your wife ? You have been married for ten years . 
 I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce . But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever ? 

I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . 
 Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too . 
 Yes . I love facing danger and overcoming it . It has become part of my life . 
 Hey , the same to you ! 
 Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! 
 Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? 
 That will be a good one ! Anything else ? 
 Sounds great ! 
 Yeah , I just got back this morning . 
 Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . 
 Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? 
 This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . 
 I know , they look very similar . 
 That was taken at the train station before we left . 
 No , not this time . We went there last time . 
 Yeah , it was a lot of fun . 
 What is it ? 
 A trip to China for summer vacation . Wow ! What a wonderful surprise ! Thank you . This is the best surprise I've ever had . 
 There're many things I can do on weekends . 
 I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ? 
 That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ? 
 I'm fond of dancing . 

Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia . 

Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? 
 Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . 
 I see.Thank you . 
 Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift . 
 Many thanks for your presence . 
 Fine , I'll take a taxi . 
 Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk . 

How did your vacation go ? 
 What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? 
 Did your boat float down the river ? 
 Sounds dangerous . 
 What a thrilling trip ! 
 True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . 
 The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . 

Do you have brothers and sisters ? 
 Oh , I have an elder sister . She is married .. Her husband is a businessman . 
 No , they live alone . 
 Why ? They are fine . 
 Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . 
 Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . 
 What's the second solar system ? 
 Is this good news or bad news ? 
 You mean with people on it ? 

I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses . 
 Will you come with me and help me choose ? 
 Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror ! 

I think it's high time we had lunch . 
 I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery . 
 I suppose the local one . 
 But he has the sex scandal . 
 I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . 
 yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . 
 Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . 
 You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . 

Would you like to play golf with me ? 
 It doesn't matter . I will teach you . 
 Borrow morning . 
 Just take your golf club . I will pick you up Borrow . 
 See you Borrow . 
 Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . 
 Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky . 

Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? 
 Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . 
 No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . 

Hey , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? 
 You know , about David and his new boss . 
 Well , I heard David has been fired . 

Did you hear Peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 

I stayed online chatting with friends all night . It was great fun . 
 It is better I don't know them . So I can say anything I want . 
 Who cares ? It's just online . It's not real . Do you want to join me tonight ? 

Do you consider yourself a good mother ? 
 How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . 
 Does your husband feel the same ? 

Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . 
 Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . 
 Right . 
 Yeah . It is not easy for them to find another job . 
 It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ? 

Two people were robbed last night near the park . 
 I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . 
 I Know . And you should be more careful , too . 
 These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week . 
 Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . 
 Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . 

I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . 
 I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . 
 Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . 
 Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad . 
 Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid . 

Have you heard of the Love Bug ? 
 Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year . 
 Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it . 

There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . 
 Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . 
 But we need the wood . 

How do you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US ? 
 Do you say prayers before dinner ? 
 What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving ? 

Do you like being a doctor ? 
 Can you tell me about it ? 
 What can you do when this happens ? 

Hi . are you new here ? 
 I'm Steven , your neighbour . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then . 

Please come in ! 
 Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home . 
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 
 You bet . 
 Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful . 
 He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage . 

Do you have a park in the city ? 
 That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon . 
 Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . 
 I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . 
 It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . 
 No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . 
 Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? 
 The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? 
 I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . 
 OK . I close my mouth . 
 No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news . 
 Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ? 
 How's your married life ? 
 I have to say you're a well-matched couple . 

I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . 
 It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . 
 Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . 

Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . 
 Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
 You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? 
 Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? 
 Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 

Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . 
 We are all very proud of you . 
 I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement . 

I like to stay here . 
 People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky . 
 Never . 
 Yeah . People down our way hardly speak to each other . 
 Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . 
 No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . 
 No , thanks . I have had enough . 
 Please bring me a cup of coffee . 
 Maybe you can't be so sure . 
 But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth . 

Where did you go yesterday ? 
 Did you go shopping ? 
 Oh , did you get a job ? 
 Fantastic . 
 Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . 
 Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy . 

Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 You work upstair , right ? I think I have seen you before . I'm Karren , Karren Brown . 
 Happy to know you , Tim . 
 Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? 
 It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . 
 Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . 
 Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . 
 Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . 
 It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . 
 Don ’ t think about it ! 
 You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up . 

Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? 
 What do you mean ? 

I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . 
 How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . 
 I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . 
 Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . 
 Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . 
 OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? 
 Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? 
 I'd like some toast and chicken wings . 
 Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . 
 Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . 

May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? 
 Why are they all in glass boxes ? 
 So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? 
 I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? 
 Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . 

I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up . 
 Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 

My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? 
 He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . 
 No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . 

The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? 
 That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . 
 But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? 
 Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? 
 You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . 
 Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze . 
 Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . 
 I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . 
 I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . 
 Thank you . 
 What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? 
 Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . 
 Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . 
 How about some fish ? 
 OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 
 It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . 
 Cheer ! 
 Half past seven in the morning . 
 In the market . 
 Bottoms up . 
 Thank you . This place is nice . 
 But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . 
 But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? 
 But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? 
 Well , you're here . And that's the main thing . 
 Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . 
 Yes , I will . 
 It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
 It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . 
 In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time . 
 See you later . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care and give my best to you parents . 

Are you free tomorrow night ? 
 Shall we have dinner together ? 
 Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . 

What time is it , Tom ? 
 Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now . 
 I must catch the nine-thirty train . 

Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last . 
 Are you OK today ? 
 So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . 

Thank you for coming to see me off . 
 If have time , I'll come again . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . 
 I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . 

Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? 
 What was it about ? 
 If so , we may live there someday . 
 Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . 

Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . 
 Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . 
 The internet's a lot worse . 
 There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . 

Who is your favorite NBA star ? 
 Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . 
 Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? 
 Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? 
 Well then , what are your spoils ? 

Hmm , what should I wear today ? 
 Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? 
 Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . 
 Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . 

How do you like this waltz ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 
 Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I only took up dancing quite recently . 
 I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
 Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 

I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . 
 But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . 
 I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . 

Would you like a cigarette ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? 
 Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . 
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? 
 Who ? Me ? Could't give up smoking ? Nonsense ! Of course I could ! I know I could ! 
 Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! 
 Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . 
 I don't know . 
 I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . 
 I will . Thanks for your advice . 
 We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . 
 Looks like a lucky day for everyone . 
 It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? 
 Do you think they'll become reconciled ? 
 What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . 
 Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director . 
 I have no idea . Tell me . 
 What does he do there ? 

Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? 
 Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name . 
 Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? 
 Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' 
 This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . 
 Hackneyed theme ! 
 Nearly everything . 
 Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . 
 Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . 
 After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . 
 Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . 
 Come on . 
 Any more ? 

Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . 
 Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . 
 It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . 
 Then fans don't see you much in public places . 
 A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' 

It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . 
 He must be all over you the first time he saw you . 
 That means he was head over heels in love with you . 
 But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . 

How did you first meet Jack each other ? 
 And then ? 
 Then he sent you to your home ? 
 It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . 
 He is so humorous . 
 I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . 

I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . 
 Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . 
 Take my word for it . 
 Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' 
 Don't be so shy , Lucy . 
 Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . 
 I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . 
 Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . 
 Why not ? 
 I have met a beautiful girl . 
 Yes . At first sight . 
 At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . 
 She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . 
 Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . 
 Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . 
 I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . 

Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . 
 I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . 
 Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . 
 Good idea . 
 I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map 
 It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . 

Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? 
 No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . 
 Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . 
 That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . 

What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that'll affect the national economy . 
 How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? 

Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 

Then I must go-you have said it yourself . 
 I tell you I must go ! 
 I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now . 
 I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . 
 I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? 
 You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . 
 Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . 
 I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . 
 I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . 
 Of course . I will . 
 It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . 

I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . 
 That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . 
 why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . 
 They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . 
 Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 
 You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . 
 You really can't live without candy . 
 I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . 
 No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . 
 Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . 
 Really ? 
 Which one ? 
 She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . 
 OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . 
 She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl . 
 No , she hasn't . 

You look a bit dull today . What's up ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . 
 Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? 
 That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . 

Do you know his sister ? 
 That's right . 
 Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . 
 Well ... 
 Yes ... quite pretty . 
 What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? 
 No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . 
 True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . 
 I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . 
 In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . 
 I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . 
 I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . 
 I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . 
 Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . 
 Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... 
 No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . 
 No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . 
 Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . 

That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? 
 Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . 

My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . 
 But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? 
 What time is the right moment ? 

Hey , buddy . Are the fish biting today ? 
 Is that so ? Well , what kind of bait are you using ? 
 Lures ? We're using live bait over here . 
 We're using worms . 
 No , we haven't even gotten a nibble today . 
 I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box . 
 I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ? 
 Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ? 
 Do you think that's a good spot ? 
 Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now . 

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? 
 You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . 
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 
 And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 
 It seems to be . How about you today ? 
 OK , I'll find the time to relax soon . 

Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . 
 It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . 
 Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . 
 Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . 
 A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . 
 You are right about that . 
 I'd like reading books best . 
 Literature and economy . 
 That's OK . 
 I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . 
 That's a bad habit . 
 If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged . 
 Middle-aged means in the middle , Ethel , middle of life . People don't live to a hundred and fifty . 
 Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging . 
 I can if you like . 
 You're leaving so soon ? I wish you stayed a little longer . 
 Have you got the ticket ? 
 What time are you going ? 
 I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport . 
 OK , goodbye . 
 Yes , my friends like to get along with me well . 
 Yes , I like to make new friends . 
 We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music . 
 Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on . 
 It depends . Sometimes I am very busy . 
 Oh , that means I can't make sure for my own . 

How many persons are there in your family ? 
 Do you live together ? 
 Do you often go back to see your parents . 

I often go to a place of leisure . 
 I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine . 
 The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there . 
 I may take you there some day . 

Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 What's your name , please ? 
 A minute , please . ... Yes , this way , please . 
 Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? 
 All right . May I have your name ? 
 How do you spell it , sir ? 
 Sure . 
 Do we have enough time ? 
 The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . 
 I can't agree more . 
 In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . 
 We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller . 

Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? 
 It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . 
 Hey , you can dance to rap music ! 

Hello , Friendship Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 Yes , Sir . For how many people , please ? 
 What time ? 
 So sorry , we're fully booked in that room . Would you like to make reservation some other time ? 

Hello , could you arrange a dinner for us ? 
 Eight o'clock tomorrow evening . 
 Ten . 
 Chinese food . 
 No , not too lavish . 
 What is the usual thing here ? 
 Let's say sixty Yuan then . 
 We'd like to have typical Chinese food . 
 No snakes , please . 
 Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer . 
 Right , thanks . 
 See you then . 
 Yes , would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow ? 
 Six o'clock in the afternoon . 
 Six . 
 We don't care about money . We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties . 
 How many courses are there altogether , please ? 
 Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ? 
 Very good . 
 Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . 
 He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . 
 That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . 
 What time do you open this evening ? 
 I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two . 
 I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm . 
 Davis . 
 Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . 
 I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . 
 Thank you . 
 How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . 
 They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? 
 Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . 
 Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . 
 I hope you have a good stereo . 
 Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . 
 A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun . 
 How did you like the movie ? 
 Really ? I can't say I agree . 
 I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . 

Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? 
 How about that European movie ? 
 Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . 
 Okay , see you then . 
 I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . 
 Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years 
 You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . 
 Read it yourself and find out ! 
 I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . 
 Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ? 
 Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance . 

People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . 
 Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . 
 I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . 
 It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . 

How is night life in Beijing ? 
 What do you suggest then ? 
 That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . 
 That's great ! I love to dance to fast music . 
 Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well . 
 Now the band is playing a slow dance . 
 Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance . 

May I invite you for a dance ? 
 You dance well . Do you breakdance ? 
 There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . 
 According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . 
 Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . 
 Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... 
 You are witty . 
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? 
 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 

What's your favorite sport ? 
 Is the entrance charge expensive ? 
 Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? 
 You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . 
 Oh , yes , it is . 
 That's a good idea . 
 It's mild , but it's not always pleasant . 
 I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . 
 You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely . 
 That's correct . We have four seasons of spring . 
 Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . 
 What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? 
 Is it very cold in winter there ? 
 Does it rain a lot in summer there ? 
 There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . 
 That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here . 
 No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . 

I really like the record you lent me the other day . 
 And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
 I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . 
 Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? 
 So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? 
 Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . 
 I'm glad you enjoyed it . 
 Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . 
 Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . 

How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? 
 How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . 
 Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . 

I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . 
 No problem . 
 I will . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . 
 I'm doing business through Internet now . 
 Yes , very good . 
 It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . 
 Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap . 
 To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided . 
 Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website . 

How do you shoot pool ? 
 And ? 
 How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? 
 Can I get the black ball in ? 
 Let's go and try now ! 
 Certainly . What's the matter ? 
 Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . 
 That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . 
 No . it's free . 

Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight . 
 That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . 
 Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . 
 Can you tell me how it is done ? 
 I see . So great . 
 I'll let you break the balls this time . 
 OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ? 

What are you doing for Christmas this year ? 
 That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too . 
 My sister.She is going to her in-law's house this year . 
 I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games . 
 I hope that I get what I asked for . 
 We wake up early and go to church.Then we come back home and open our gifts together . How about you ? 

( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight 
 Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine ! 
 I've already got mine . 
 Here ! Open mine first . 
 Hey ! Why don't I have any presents ! 
 Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ? 
 Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . 
 Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches . 
 Let's switch the lights on . 
 Well , I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas . 
 Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . 
 As long as I don ’ t have to row . 
 Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . 
 I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . 
 I didn't sleep much last night . 
 You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up . 
 I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . 
 Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
 Yes . 
 Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you . 
 I'd love a gin and tonic . 
 Thank you for inviting me . 
 A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . 
 It's nice to be here . 
 Just a club soda for me , please . 
 Whose name did you pick ? 
 Booze ! 

Do you know what the BBS is ? 
 Tell me then . 
 Oh , I see , but what's it used for ? 
 Tell me in details . 
 Oh , that's great . I want to try later . 

I need your help , Bob . 
 I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . 
 A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? 
 Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? 
 Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . 
 Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . 

Did you listen to the weather forecast ? 
 There's a typhoon coming . 
 Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . 
 I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . 
 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? 
 Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? 
 Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? 
 Do you still like playing those games ? 
 Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . 
 No , I prefer to play with people I know . 
 It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . 
 I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! 
 I just stayed at home and watched TV . 
 Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . 
 It ended in a tie . 
 It was three all . 
 If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . 
 Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . 
 How many more games are left this season ? 
 When do the playoffs start ? 
 Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . 
 Sure , that would be great . 

Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? 
 Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . 
 They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . 
 Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? 
 Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? 
 I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . 
 I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . 
 Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! 

What happened ? Why didn't he win ? 
 How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
 What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
 That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
 Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . 
 Let's hope so . 
 What's that ? 
 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . 
 Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . 
 That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . 
 I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . 
 Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 
 Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! 

What date is it today ? 
 Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . 

Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? 
 How about going to a concert ? 

Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? 
 Tell me all about it . 
 Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? 
 You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . 
 I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . 
 Oh , nothing . 
 ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . 
 I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . 
 That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . 
 Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . 
 What note ? 
 You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . 
 Yeah , I want the note . 
 Thanks . I plan on it . 
 Speaking . Who's calling , please ? 
 Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ? 
 Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . 
 Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style . 
 But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke 
 I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? 
 Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . 
 That's good . 
 Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? 
 Do you know anyone in the play ? 
 Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? 
 So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? 
 Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? 
 What did you do ? 
 I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . 
 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 

Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . 
 What should I do then ? 
 I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? 

Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? 
 That's too bad ! 

Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ? 
 Doing anything for lunch ? 

Merry Christmas ! 
 Are you doing anything special ? 
 Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
 Thanks.You too ! 
 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 

Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . 
 It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . 
 Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ? 
 Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ? 

T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ? 

Do you like swimming ? 
 Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . 
 Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? 

How do you like these dishes ? 
 Did you enjoy your dinner ? 
 Would you like some more rice ? 
 Another piece of meat pie ? 
 How about the dessert ? 

Congratulations on the new house ! 
 Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . 

What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? 
 You have to do something romantic . 
 Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! 

What are you doing this Saturday ? 
 Do you want to go see a movie ? 
 What's playing at the Century Fox ? 
 Should we go see it ? 
 How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ 
 Why don't we go to a concert instead ? 

Another glass of beer , will you ? 
 At least one for your trip . 

Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! 
 Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . 

Have you gone bowling before ? 
 There are 10 frames in a bowling game . Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame . 
 ' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms . 
 Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing . 
 I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . 
 Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? 
 Really ? I will try again . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 

I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . 
 Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . 
 Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . 

May I know how old you are ? 
 What is your date of birth ? 

When and where were you born ? 
 You look so young . 

Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . 
 I want to do everything I can . 
 No . Can I rent clubs ? 
 What kinds of clubs ? 
 I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . 

This little wooden stick is called a tee . 
 For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . 
 Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . 
 Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . 
 Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . 

Where is your native place ? 
 So are you a local ? 

I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert . 
 I don't like going to the theatre . 
 Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? 
 I like talking to you , too . 
 That's a good idea . 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 

Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
 Who won ? 
 What was the score ? 
 Wonderful ! 
 Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . 
 I only had time to visit Edinburgh . 
 It's fantastic . 
 I went there on business . 
 Yes , a lot of friends . 
 Yes , and I look many pictures . 
 Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . 
 Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . 

I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? 
 Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? 
 Could you move smoothly ? 
 What happened afterwards ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . 
 No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better . 
 Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . 
 Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? 
 Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . 
 Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . 
 I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . 
 Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . 

It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . 
 How come you think of him that way ? 
 I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . 
 Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . 

Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ? 
 Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 
 Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . 
 Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? 
 What's your favorite dance ? 
 How about rock'n'roll ? 
 And the tango ? 
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? 
 Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then . 
 OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? 
 Are we going to walk or drive ? 
 The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . 
 No , he's still sleeping . 
 Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM . 
 I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there . 
 It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . 
 I went on a trip with my family last week . 
 We went to Europe . 
 London , Paris and a few other cities . 
 No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . 
 That's what I've heard . 
 Thanks . 
 I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . 
 I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . 
 You'd just let sleeping dogs lie . 
 Anything you say or do might make it worse . Just try to ride out the storm for a while . 
 You'd better leave her alone . 
 Just tell her off . 

I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth . 
 I want to apologize . Is there anything can do for you ? 

Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . 
 Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . 
 Well , it's Thursday today . 
 The 5th . 
 Yes , it's much better than yesterday . 
 Oh , let's just hope it stays warm . 
 A quarter past five . 
 See you . 
 Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . 
 That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? 
 Certainly . 
 That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye . 

How are you doing , Christopher ? 
 Are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 Are you available on Sunday ? 
 Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? 
 It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
 We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . 
 Do you like surfing ? 
 We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
 You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . 
 We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! 
 I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . 
 Sure , they do . 
 Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection . 
 That ’ s what I can do . 
 I'm sorry , Steven . 
 I know . But I ’ m not ready for married life yet . 
 Your way does touch my heart . 
 I want to think of it for some time . 
 He's going to turn six next month . 
 My mother-in - law . She retired last year . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 Sounds good , when ? 
 Any time is fine . 
 Please wait for us even if we're a little late . 
 See you then . 

Would you honor us with a visit ? 
 When will you be convenient ? 
 Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
 I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ? 

Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? 
 The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . 
 Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . 
 Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . 
 Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? 
 For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . 
 Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? 
 Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . 

When will our party be held ? 
 Have you sent out invitations by our party ? 
 When ? 
 Could Dr.Cole like to attend the party ? 
 That's fine . 
 Hi , good morning , you are so early today . 
 I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ? 
 Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ? 
 You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle . 

May I have a word with you ? 
 When will you be free ? 
 Shall I say around ten o'clock ? 

Are you free this Saturday evening ? 
 Would you like to go to the concert with me ? 
 At our club . 
 At 7:30 p . m . 
 I'm so pleased that you can go . 
 Yes , do you like it ? 
 Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 It must have been a few years ago now . 
 They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! 
 The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 

You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Is he getting better now ? 

Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China . 
 The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ? 

Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . 
 Do you like him ? 
 Then why are you hesitating ? 
 One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . 

Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? 
 We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? 
 What a pity ! You can't join us . 

Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ? 
 So you have two brothers ? 

Hello ! So you are leaving today . 
 It is my pleasure to see you off . 
 I hope so , too . 
 You're welcome . Have a nice trip ! 
 Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . 
 In some way , she is more modern . 
 If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely . 
 Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . 
 She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . 
 Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . 
 Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . 
 I'm a student . 
 Tsinghua University . 
 You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? 
 Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . 
 OK , they begin to register . 
 Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . 
 No , they live in Shanghai , my hometown . 
 Once a year . 
 Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ? 
 That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . 
 Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am . 
 Sorry , I can't dance . 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 How should I do ? 
 All right . By the way , do you often dance ? 
 It seems a good way . 
 Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory . 
 My boss wants me to finish this project tonight . 
 I have no idea , any suggestions ? 
 It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess . 
 OK , settled then . 
 See you ! 
 No , he isn ’ t . 
 He is afraid of his father-in-law . 
 We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . 
 Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much . 
 Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . 

We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ? 
 Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us . 
 Good ! 
 How about 6:00 ? 

Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ? 
 Do you know why ? 

How's your business ? 
 Things are tough all over . You should never give up ! 
 I think you should make a thorough market investigation now . 
 I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up . 
 Yeah , you can make it . 
 Is he beating Mark ’ s time ? 

Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? 
 But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . 

Are you ready to go the concert ? 
 Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . 
 Is your helmet comfortable ? 
 Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . 
 Is that your new bicycle ? 
 It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! 
 I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . 
 It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . 
 Yes.Do you like it ? 
 Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . 
 Did you always like pop music . 
 I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . 
 Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . 
 It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . 
 Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? 
 Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? 
 Did you go diving while you were there ? 
 Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? 
 Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? 
 No , but I do like snowboarding . 
 I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! 

Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life . 
 What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? 
 When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that . 
 I know that's what I must do . 
 Hi . 
 I'm good . How are you ? 
 A little . Are you American ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 Nice to meet you . 

Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? 
 How does 7:30 sound ? 

How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? 
 I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . 

Excuse me , what's your name ? 
 John . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . It's 5:10 PM . 
 I said it's 5:10 PM . 
 You're welcome . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 That's fine . I'm looking forward to it . 
 Fine , how are you doing ? 
 What do you want to do ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 What kind of Italian food do you like ? 
 No , I don't , but I like pizza . 
 Which song ? 
 No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? 
 No . How about going to karaoke tonight ? 

Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? 
 Let's say about 6:00 ? 

Are you OK ? 
 Because ... I heard John got married yesterday . 
 No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad . 

What day is today ? 
 Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . 
 We'll meet again in a few days . 
 They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . 

It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . 
 I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . 

Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 Avril Lavigen ! 
 Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... 
 Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too . 
 Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . 
 She looked sweeter than her pictures . 
 No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs . 

So you are green with envy at your neighbor ? 
 But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life . 

Some people are easily flimflammed . 
 They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course . 

Charlotte , have you had your supper ? 
 Why ? Don't you feel well ? 
 What's up ? 
 You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . 
 You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . 
 Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . 
 Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time . 
 All right , just a quick one . 
 I'd love to . 
 Any day except Tuesday . 
 Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ? 
 Yes , of course . Thank you very much . 

I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ? 
 Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ? 
 Never ? Really ? I'm surprised . 
 But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here . 

May I have an appointment with you tonight ? 
 OK . where and when ? 
 OK , I am going to the hotel to pick you up . See you tomorrow night . 
 I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable . 

Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? 
 Let's say about 6:00 ? 

Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! 
 Yes , it is . How do you know that ? 
 Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? 
 That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . 
 So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? 

Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? 
 How does 7:30 sound ? 

Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ? 
 Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster . 
 OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late . 
 ( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ? 
 Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story . 
 Ah , you're just too emotional . 

I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ? 
 That's too bad . What does he have ? 
 Let me know if there's anything I can do . 

Do you know Mark ? 
 Can you introduce him to me ? 

Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my schoolmates . 
 Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . 

Hi Mark . 
 What are you planning to do today ? 
 Would you like to have lunch with me ? 
 Is 11:30 AM OK ? 
 I said , 11:30 AM . 
 OK , how about 12:30 PM ? 
 How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? 
 It's on 7th Street . 

I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision . You cannot find a better one . 
 No . But I ’ m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so . 

How's your brother doing ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What's the matter ? 
 I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him . 
 Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me . 
 Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people . 

Where's Tom this evening ? 
 Really ! What's the matter with him ? 
 Tell him I was asking about him . 

What's the temperature today ? 
 What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 Are you used to the climate here ? 
 What is the average temperature of Beijing ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 

How's your father been ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Well , tell him to take it easy and that I hope he feels better . 

Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 I'm a doctor . 
 New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ? 
 What do you teach ? 
 Where ? 
 That's nice . How old are you ? 

I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it . 
 I really feel bad about it . Let me buy you a new one . 

It seems to be clearing up . 
 I really don't think this weather will last . 

Beautiful day , isn't it ? 
 I wish it would stay this way for the weekend . 

How's the weather today ? 
 I really don't think this weather will last . 

I think it's going to be a nice day . 
 But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . 

Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? 
 Is today OK ? 
 How about tomorrow night ? 
 Is 9:00 PM all right ? 
 Is 6:00 PM OK ? 
 The Italian restaurant on 5th street . 
 How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? 

John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? 
 It's ... OH , it's the first of April , April Fools ' Day . 

Is it going to rain today ? 
 I really hate this weather . 

What's the weather today ? 
 What was the weather like yesterday ? 
 What will the weather be like tomorrow ? 

What is today ? 
 So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! 

What day is today ? Tuesday ? 
 I bet it's May 5th . 
 Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven . 
 I think so . I see it by the radio this morning . 
 No , I'm full . 
 Yes , I'd like some coffee . 
 That's OK . I'll have a glass of water . 
 Small please . 
 Thanks . 

Can you tell me the time ? 
 Is your watch right ? 

What time is it by your watch ? 
 It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . 

Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ? 
 At 10 o'clock . 
 No , at night . 
 OK , how about 1:30 PM ? 
 How about 5:00 PM ? 
 OK , see you then . 

Is the clock right ? 
 By how many minutes ? 

Joseph , who is that woman ? 
 What does she do for work ? 
 Is she American ? 
 She's really tall . Do you know her ? 
 Who's that man standing next to her ? 
 That short guy on her right . What's his name ? 
 He's really good looking . 
 Do you know him ? 
 Is he married ? 
 I remember now . I met him before . 
 It says a storm may come tomorrow . 
 Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? 
 What bad luck ! 
 Yeah , maybe you are right ! 
 Did it spill on your clothes ? 
 That's OK . 
 It's no big deal . 
 Don't be silly , forget about it . 
 Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it . 
 Okay , forget about that . S , do you have some practical dreams at present ? 
 You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up . 

John , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you ! 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 I know your feeling . Take it easy and say something to me if you like . 
 Not at all ! 
 It's nothing to get upset about . 
 No . It's out of the question . 
 Well , I like playing the violin . 
 About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . 
 Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . 
 Yes , that is why I never drink it . 
 Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . 
 What good is it for ? 
 That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . 
 Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . 
 Yes . 
 I learned in college . 
 Thank you . 
 3 weeks . 
 Yes , she just got here yesterday . 
 No . I've never been there . 
 Yes . I went there once on a business trip . 
 Yes . 
 I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion . 
 I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . 
 Why are you going there ? 
 I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? 
 Do you have the bank card in Japan ? 
 That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? 
 Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . 

Hey , How's it going ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Was it stolen ? 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 Sure , how much do you need ? 
 That's no problem . 
 That'll be fine . Here you are . 
 I'm going to buy some books and then I'm going to the gas station . 
 OK . I'll wait for you . 
 Which one will you be going to ? 
 Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . 
 OK , can I bring a date with me ? 
 Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . 
 I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? 
 I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . 
 One last question.Is there a dress code there ? 
 Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . 
 Okay . See you then . 
 Yes , I have been working for eight hours . 
 No , really . I'm not in the mood for it . 
 Possibly . 
 Not a bit . 
 I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . 
 According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . 
 Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . 
 It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? 
 Yes , let's do it now . 
 John , I am just not in the mood for this . 
 I lost the table tennis game yesterday . 
 I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . 
 My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . 
 Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure . 

Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? 
 You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . 
 Just take it easy . Come on with me . 

I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 That's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced . 
 I think you're right . An international response to this problem is needed . 
 I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . 
 Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . 
 All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . 
 What , it keeps coming back ? 
 Flares ? 
 It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . 

How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? 
 Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . 
 You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . 

You know , smoking does do harm to your health . 
 Why don't you try to give it up ? 
 Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . 

Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? 
 There were some famous ugly women in history . 
 Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . 
 Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . 
 Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . 
 I think the supermarket is closed now . 
 It closes at 7:00 on Sundays . 
 Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 . 
 Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . 
 She lives in San Francisco . 
 I think she's lived there for about 10 years . 
 San Diego . 
 I stayed up all night writing a report . 

Charles , do you have any children ? 
 How many children do you have ? 
 What are their names ? 
 How old are they ? 
 Are they in school ? 
 What does Stephanie study ? 
 Is she here now ? 

Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek . 
 Step up onto the rail . Hold on . Keep your eyes closed . Trust me ? 
 All right , open your eyes . ( Rose opens her eyes . She stretches her arms , and Jack stands behind her , arms around her . ) 

Do you like tea ? 
 Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on . 
 Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . 
 Sure . 
 I will . 
 I see . And I'll always be devoted to you . 
 I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie . 
 It can't be dry , and can't die . 
 Aha , Aha ... 
 I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . 
 It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . 
 We offer many different sea water treatments . 
 The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three . 
 OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . 
 The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you . 
 But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . 

Hey , Joshua ! Is Anny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I'm just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? 
 I'd totally die if she turned me down . 

Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! 
 I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . 
 That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . 
 Always . 
 How did you know that I love red roses ? 
 ( at the dance ) That band is playing good music . Shall we dance ? 
 Foxtrot . Oh . you're a good dancer . 
 I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely . 
 What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ? 
 Then , what shall we do on Sunday . 
 Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . 

What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! 
 From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? 
 Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . 
 She's chic , isn't she ? 
 It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . 
 Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . 
 The gown is quite expensive , believe me . 
 You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . 
 Thanks . I'm flattered . 

At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! 
 Do you know any secrets to China's success ? 
 So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . 
 For example ? 
 Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! 

Hi , Bill . I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl . 
 Are you sure she is the right girl ? 
 What type of girl is she ? 
 Oh , that's great . You're serious this time . 
 Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . 
 Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . 
 Yes . Will it hurt us ? 
 OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . 
 You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . 
 How do you know ? 

Sarah , what did you do today ? 
 Did you buy anything ? 
 What did you buy ? 
 Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? 
 Was it expensive ? 
 That's cheap . 
 I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . 
 All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ? 
 What kind of music is it ? 
 When is it ? 
 Yeah , I'd like to go . Do you think we should have dinner first ? 
 Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment . 
 Yes , that's right . You have a good memory . 
 Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister . 
 That sounds fine . 
 I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ? 
 I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday ! 
 Well , he's very tall and handsome . 
 He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . 
 Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . 
 He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . 
 He's quite a patient teacher , too . 
 You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy . 
 Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! 
 You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . 
 All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . 
 No , you can't , darling . The grass is wet . 
 No , you can't . The bench is wet , too . 
 Can't you see a notice on the bench ? 
 What does the notice say ? 

Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ? 
 Where do your parents live ? 
 How about your mother ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ? 
 Do you have any family here ? 
 Do you have any brothers or sisters ? 
 Do you see them a lot ? 

I finally went out to dinner with him last night . 
 Yup . 
 True , a sea food restaurant . 
 I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . 

How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh . he's my Romeo ! 
 Oh , Mary . You've surprised me ! 
 Um — I was just thinking aloud . 
 Come off it , Mary . 
 You certainly do like teasing me , Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is , how do I get his attention ? 
 I guess I asked the wrong person . 
 Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . 

I want to say ... 
 That I can't go on any longer without you . 
 Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . 
 Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . 
 I really love you . 
 And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . 

Are you having a good time ? 
 Really ? Come on , I'll introduce them to you . 

How come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? 
 As far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? 
 You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . 
 Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
 You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . 
 Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . 
 Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! 
 Hello , Steven ! 
 Not bad . What about you ? 
 Why ? 
 How is your family ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 OK , see you next time . 

Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 
 Where did you end up going ? 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 
 Sure . What's this one a picture of ? 
 You don't look very happy in that picture . 
 So what did you do ? 
 My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 
 That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
 Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . 
 It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . 
 If you have any question , you can ask me . 
 All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye . 

The man behind your mother must be your elder brother . 
 He looked his age . 
 Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . 
 Yes , my sister loves his personality . 
 Good news ! And congratulations ! 
 Thank you . I'll certainly be there . 
 I go jogging , how about you ? 
 Oh , that's fantastic ! 
 Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart . 
 Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ? 

Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . 
 Were you one of them ? 

Hello , Kevin . 
 Thanks . You too . 
 Pretty good . How's your business going , Kevin ? 

Hi ! My name is Mike . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I'm from Shanghai . And you ? 

What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? 
 Moblogging ? what does that mean ? 
 Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . 
 How can you do that ? 
 What if you want to publish some photos ? 
 I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . 

Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? 
 Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . 
 She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . 
 Not at all . She's actually very athletic . 
 No , but she does wear contact lenses . 
 She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . 
 I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . 
 It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one . 
 Yes , even her mother . 
 She's a lot like me . 

Can you tell Bob from Tom ? 
 Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . 

Charles , have you finished your homework ? 
 I want you to have a walk with me . 

Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . 
 You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases . 

Do you know what E-commerce is ? 
 That's right 
 Sure , but you must have access to the Internet . 
 Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . 
 There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . 
 Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . 
 Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? 
 Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . 
 It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . 
 Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . 
 Yep . 
 Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . 
 No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? 
 I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . 

Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy . 
 This dish tastes terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good . 
 Would you like another beer ? 
 Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers ! 

Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . 
 Where were you ? 

What date is it today ? 
 Look at the girls in the street . They all have a bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? 
 Did you have a fight with Jack ? 
 Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . 
 Is that your phone ? 
 Wow ! Good timing . 
 Come on ! Three's a crowd ! 
 Just go ! It's Valentine's Day ! 
 Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? 
 Sure . Meet me at five . 
 Sure , I'm heading out myself . Enjoy your evening . 
 Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! 
 Oh , yes please ! I'd love a gin and tonic . 
 Oh , just olives please . What music is this ? 
 It's great ! Where did you get the CD ? 
 Yes . I buy a lot of stuff from there . It's a good shop , isn't it ? 
 Why not ? I'd love to ! 
 Because we are partners in our science lab . Why are you so jealous ? 
 My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek . 
 Of course I am . I only love you , Amy . 
 Why do you always accuse me like that ? 
 Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world . 
 Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world ! 

How are you ? 
 I'm okay . What are you doing these days ? 
 That's great . When are you starting ? 

Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages ! 
 Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? 

Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon ? 
 I'm sorry . I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then . 
 No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ? 
 Good idea ! Is two o'clock okay ? 

Terrible . How about people's lives ? 
 That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . 
 That's why many people died in the earthquake . 
 Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . 
 We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . 
 That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . 
 Can you imagine she's over forty ? 
 Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics . 
 I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Yeah , I got home around two . 
 It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . 
 I don't know . 
 Believe me , you really look much better than before . 

Can I use your laptop for a while ? 
 Oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? 
 Oh my , no internet access is killing me . 
 No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . 
 What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . 
 That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . 

I plan to buy a car this year . 
 I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . 

What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
 How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . 

How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? 
 We could find a classical one . 

Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! 
 Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy . 
 Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
 Absolutely . 
 Yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . 
 Yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . 

Are you a blogger ? 
 Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? 
 What do you usually write about ? 
 That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? 
 Got it . Are you still updating your blog ? 
 Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . 
 Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time . 
 Yes , the same as ever , thanks . What about you ? 
 Good bye then , and keep in touch . 

You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? 
 But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . 
 Can't you hang out with them , too ? 
 Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 
 It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . 
 She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . 
 I still think you two should try to patch things up . 

How did you spend the weekend ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? 
 Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? 
 Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . 

Did Roll win the race ? 
 But anyway , he won at last . 

Ben cancelled his trip . 
 Because General , his dog , got sick . 

What do you want for your birthday from your parents ? 
 Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC ? You will soon use it at college . 

What is the matter with him ? 
 I feel he is as cold as charity to me . 

Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here ! 
 Fine . How is Jim ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . 
 How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . 
 That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? 
 You are a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hot pot ? 
 Ok , you are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? 
 Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
 No ... 
 That's it ! That ’ s the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! 

How is your ankle ? 
 Please be careful next time . 

Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang . 
 Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou . 

What does your mother do , may I ask ? 
 Is she busy ? 

I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . 
 Good night . See you tomorrow . 
 Hello , Xu Hua . I'm Paula . I'm American . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello , my name is Paula . Nice to meet you ! 

Well , I've got to go . See you later . 
 Thanks , you too . 
 She's my grandma . 
 92 . 
 Sure it is . Why don't we go to a park ? 

Song , I hate to say goodbye , but I have to . 
 Let's keep in touch . 

ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? 
 We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . 
 Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . 
 There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . 
 All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ? 

They must be your parents , what do they do ? 
 Do they often take you out ? 

This is my uncle , Charles . 
 He's a captain . 
 Exactly ! 
 That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling . 
 Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . 
 He was 20 years old then . 
 He's over sixty . 
 Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . 
 He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . 
 He's a hero in our town . 
 Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . 
 Certainly.Go ahead . 
 No , after you . Ladies first . 

Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ? 
 What a pity ! The party is very interesting . 
 Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety . 

Tomorrow's Carl's birthday ? 
 Good idea ! Let's make ready , then . 
 Yes , my old friend Hanson lives there 
 Yes . He's one of my best friends . Our friendship formed at college . Why did you ask that ? 
 I get it . You want to find a guide , don ’ t you ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I will call Hanson , and ask him to help you . 

Let me hold the door for you , miss . 

Julia , are you free tonight ? 
 I want to invite you to go to the movies . 
 Yes . 
 Where do you want to meet ? 
 What time should we meet ? 
 All right . 
 It's nice of you to see my off at the airport . Thank you very much . 
 Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days . 
 Certainly . I'll be glad to . 
 Yes , we should go . Thank you very much . Goodbye ! 

Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . 
 I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . 
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 
 The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . 
 Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 
 That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . 
 Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 
 I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
 Sure.Where would you suggest ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? 
 Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! 
 Thank you , same to you ! Lee , have you got any plans ? 
 How nice ! Have fun ! 
 Merry Christmas , Lee ! 
 Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it . 
 I was away for my vacation . 
 Good . I wish I could have another vacation . 
 To tell the truth , I feel tired . 
 I had to visit all my relatives . 
 Thank you . Here's a present for you . 

You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . 
 Do you feel ok ? 
 Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . 
 You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . 
 Zach , what's that on your arm ? 
 It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? 
 I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . 
 We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . 

Which season do you like best ? 
 I like autumn , too . Where I'm from , Autumn is the best time of year . 
 Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? 
 Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? 
 His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? 
 Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? 
 What a lucky man . 
 What's that ? 
 The poor thing . It must be difficult being him . 

What's the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Is it hot in summer ? 

Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ? 
 Why ? 

Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . 
 I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . 
 Nothing rang a bell . 
 I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one . 
 Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . 
 You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain . 
 You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . 
 Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky ! 
 I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . 
 I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful . 
 All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . 
 It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 
 It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish . 
 There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . 
 It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 

Please fill out the form . 
 It's August the thirteenth . 
 My immediate family is quite small . It ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? 
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 
 I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . 
 No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . 

Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ? 
 If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? 
 Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 

How is everything going with your girlfriend ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? 
 Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? 
 What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? 
 I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! 
 I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? 
 I know . It ’ s always nice to have some closure , but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend . 
 I have to run to the grocery store . 
 Yes , but I am out of food and milk . 
 The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . 
 I hear they have very nice stuff . 
 Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . 

How was your holiday to Cyprus ? 
 Did you happen to meet someone ? 
 You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ? 
 Was it love at first sight ? 
 And ? 
 That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ? 
 It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ? 

How are you doing , Andrew ? 
 But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? 
 What about me ? I ’ m your friend . 
 I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? 
 I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . 
 What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . 

What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? 
 Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! 
 Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 
 Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 
 That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 
 You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 

What do you think of the coming match ? 
 You are bragging again . 
 I am reading a book about money management . 
 Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . 
 Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . 
 Thank you for your caring . I will . 

You like movies ? 
 What type do you like the best ? 
 I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . 
 True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . 
 I'm totally with you on that . 
 We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . 
 Like what ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 
 Is the house pretty run-down . 
 Was it a very old house ? 
 Is it in a good location ? 

The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ? 
 Why do you say so ? 

Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? 
 It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! 
 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . 
 My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England . 
 Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . 
 No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! 
 No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! 
 So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it . 
 You got it . 
 Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . 

I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting . 
 Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list . 
 Morning , Lee . How are you ? 

Your tie is handsome . 

Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ? 
 How about having dinner with me ? 
 Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything . 
 See you . 
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 
 You bet . 
 Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . 
 I really appreciate you for having invited me . 
 Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ? 
 I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook . 

Hi , Bob . Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ? 
 Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . 
 How long would you like to keep it ? 
 Yes , that'd be all right . 
 You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company . 

How do you arrange this summer vacation ? 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . 
 Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . 

Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ? 
 How about the second of March ? 
 It's Friday . 

Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ? 
 Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard . 

Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ? 
 Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ? 

Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China . 
 We are ready to help you . 
 I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again . 
 Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing ! 

I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! 
 It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . 
 That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth . 
 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . 
 Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . 
 That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
 I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! 
 Basketball , I'm a basketball fan . 
 Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . 
 Table tennis . 
 Not really , but I like watching . 
 Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . 
 Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . 
 A couple of times . 
 Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . 
 No , not so soon . Couldn ’ t I persuade you to stay a couple of days more ? 
 I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting . 
 I will miss you . 
 It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow . 
 Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch . 
 Goodbye and have a good flight . 

What is your favorite pastime ? 
 Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings . 

What are your hobbies ? 
 Like what ? 

Good morning ! 
 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares ! 
 I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . 
 Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . 
 For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 
 Ok , I'll try that . 
 Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . 
 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
 You're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 
 No , but we still stay in touch . 
 We contact through email . 
 Your words sound a bit reasonable . But don ’ t forget the time difference . 

What do you do in your spare time ? 
 What kind of music do you like ? 
 Actually me , too . 
 But many roads are very narrow . 
 Yes , because of fewer people . 
 Yes . 
 Hi . My name is Jessica . 
 Pleased to meet you too . And where are you from , Robin ? 
 I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . 

The city has got a traffic problem . 
 You said it . 

Are you enjoying your trip to New Orleans ? 
 Would you like to do something tonight ? 
 Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ? 
 OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ? 
 So , what do you want to do ? 
 Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . 

Smith is always careless , it is his Achilles ’ s heel . 
 He will burn his fingers . 

What did you do this weekend , Kate ? 
 That sounds nice . Where did you go ? 
 Not really . I just worked on my car all day . 
 But then what would I do every weekend ? 
 Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . 
 Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ? 
 How about some salad to go with your chicken ? 
 Would you like to have rice with your chicken ? 
 Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set . 
 I live in an apartment downtown . 
 Not much . But there is a lot of traffic . I can't stand the noise sometimes ! Where do you live ? 
 Oh , I bet it's really quiet . But is there much to do there ? 
 Hey . Let's trade places one weekend ! 

Did you enjoy the movie ? 
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . 

How about the matter ? 
 It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation . 

There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one . 

My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . 
 But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . 

Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ? 
 How old were you ? 
 So , did you go to college right away ? 
 Wow , your English is really fluent now . 
 Yeah , but I was born here ! ! 
 Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . 
 Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . 
 Well , we went to a dance club . 
 Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! 
 What a miser ! He cycles to school every day . 
 I can't understand him anyway . 
 I'm not feeling too well . I've caught a cold . 
 Hasn't it ! It's been cold and windy recently.Do you like the weather here ? 
 Oh , I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn . What's the weather like in New York ? 
 Is it cold in autumn there ? Should I take any warm clothes with me ? 

Bob is really handsome . 
 I wish I were just as handsome . 

Mary likes mountain climbing . 
 Yes , she's a professional climber . 

My friend George has been to Switzerland twice . 
 Yes , he likes the people and the quietness there . 

He loves that blonde girl . 
 Did she accept it ? 

I'm dreadfully sorry for you . 
 Is there any clue ? 

He has worked five years in that bank . 
 You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank . 

How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! 
 I have reported it to the police . 

I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 

He has to deliver letters every day . 
 Oh , no , he likes the job . 

I have been feeling sick for three days . 
 Not much better.Thank you . 
 Yes , she's been like this for two weeks . 
 So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . 
 I do sympathize with you , I assure you . 
 I hope your grandfather will recover soon . 
 Yeah , I'm very worried about his health . 
 He's working too hard . 
 No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? 
 How much was the ticket ? 

Bob's sister will go to America . 
 I thought you wanted to know more about her . 

Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 No , I listen to background music . 
 The radio has too many comerials . 

I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . 
 Oh , he's a very serious person . 

Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 
 No , I'm not hungry . 

My brother joined the army last year . 
 He's tall and strong . 

Have you heard we'll have a pay rise ? 
 It's a pity , but why ? 

Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking ! 
 Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . 

I like the kid.He ' s so lovely . 
 Twelve.He ' s very sensible for his age . 
 Is it stimulating ? 
 I hope I still have chances . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 

Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
 Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . 

What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? 
 We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed.He ' s strict with himself too . 
 They have moved to Chicago . 
 Mr.Smith has changed his job . 
 Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . 
 Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . 
 Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . 
 In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . 
 Yes , we're making plans for a tour . 
 Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . 
 Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? 
 Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . 
 You can say that again . 
 What kind of movie is it ? 
 Oh , I've no interest in such films . 
 I'm sorry for hero . 
 Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect . 
 Her acting is OK . 
 I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? 
 Oh yeah ? 
 How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 What did you do after graduation ? 
 Sounds like you're happy with your decision . 
 It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . 
 While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . 
 I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . 

How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? 
 You don't like the performance , do you ? 

Whose part do you think is best played ? 
 You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 

Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ? 
 This one . 
 No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button . 

That was a nice funeral . 
 The son gave a nice speech about his father . 
 I think it was about 45 minutes long . 
 I liked it . 
 Do you think anyone will come to my funeral ? 
 I think only the family will be there . 

I have lots of friends . 
 I don't know , maybe one hundred . 
 Of course . I have lots of best friends . 
 I think about twenty-five . 
 I feel sorry for you . 
 You must be lonely . I will share my friends with you . 

What's your email address ? 
 Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ? 
 No . That's incomplete . 
 What's your mailing address ? 
 That's correct . 
 Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code . 

I hate to go outside . 
 Why do you hate to go outside ? 
 I agree . 
 Rude people are everywhere . 
 You can yell at them . 
 Yelling doesn't do any good . 

I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather . 
 Mario Puku . 
 I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . 
 I don't know . I just woke up . 
 Okay . It looks like rain . 
 The sky is gray . 
 No . 
 The street isn't wet . 
 You'd better take an umbrella . 
 Why would I do that ? 
 Some men do , but not me . 
 I'm an open book . Watch me all you want . 
 You won't catch me , because I love you . I'm not a cheater . 
 I don't want any other woman . 
 Honey , please . You're the only woman for me , forever . I swear it . 
 I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music . 

Hi , how are you doing ? 
 I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . 
 I've been great . What about you ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 Do you like it there ? 
 Good luck with school . 

Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? 
 Do you have a ride home ? 
 That's good . Do you live near here ? 
 I live downtown , with my parents . 
 I don't need a car . I walk to work . 

What's your new girlfriend like ? 
 Does she know how to speak Spanish ? 
 Wow ! ! ! 
 That's terrific ! 
 What's that ? 

Where are you from , Laura ? 
 Oh , so you're from South America . 
 Oh , right . My geography isn't very good ! 
 Oh , I'm fine . 
 Maybe ... but I don't think so . 
 I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . 
 Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . 
 It's not even noon yet . 
 I am dying from the heat . 
 It doesn't work . 
 I don't know . 
 Of course . 
 He's busy . He said next week . 
 Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . 
 Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . 
 Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? 
 That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? 

Where do you work , Andrea ? 
 Oh , really ? What do you do there ? 
 That sounds interesting ! 
 I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too . 
 In a fast-food restaurant . 
 Hamburger Heaven . 
 No , I don't like it very much . Do you ? 
 Oh , does he play the piano ? 
 I like rock a lot . 
 The Cranberries . I love their music . How about you ? Do you like them ? 

Hello , Chandler ! How are you ? 
 Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately . 
 Good ? ! For them but not to me . 
 We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . 
 Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? 

Tell me about your brother and sister , Sue . 
 Really ? Does she live here in Seattle ? 
 Wow ! ! And what does your brother do ? 
 What an interesting family ! 
 Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ? 
 That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ? 
 Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 . 

Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? 
 I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . 
 Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . 
 But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . 
 That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . 
 I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . 
 Just as Forrest ? 
 I got it . 
 Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! 
 I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . 
 Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . 
 No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . 
 They sure are . 
 The one that stole a small plane ? 
 Did they catch him ? 
 Did he crash ? 
 Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ? 
 Poor guy . 
 How do you know ? 
 Do they know what the robber looks like ? 
 What race is he ? 
 The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . 
 But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? 
 Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . 
 Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas . 
 In 1978 . I went to college here . 
 Drama . I was an actor for five years after college . 
 Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? 
 Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . 
 No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ? 
 Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn . 

I'm so excited ! We have two weeks off ! What are you going to do ? 
 Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . 
 Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room . 

Hi , Stephanie . I hear you have a new job . 
 So how do you like it ? 
 Not bad . You know I'm an air traffic controller now . 
 Yes , but it's very stressful . 
 Brian ! How have you been ? 
 Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . 
 I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . 

Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ? 
 Great . How long were you away ? 
 That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ? 
 So , what was the best thing about your trip ? 

Mary , it's good to see you ! 
 I am so glad that you decided to stop by ! 
 Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ? 
 How about a little snack then ? 
 Well then , how is your family ? 

Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? 
 I wanted to go to Malibu beach . 
 The water there looks so dirty . 
 I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . 
 It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . 
 If that's okay with you . 

Hi Julie , how are things going ? 
 I'm doing really well . 
 Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? 
 I thought that he was with Malia . 
 I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! 

He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans . 
 Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person . 
 You like to communicate with him ? 
 Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed . 
 Ok , I will . You have said that many times . 
 No , there ’ s no need . Thank you all the same . 
 Thanks , Miss . Wang . 
 Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much . 
 Hi . My name is Dolma . 
 Good to meet you too . 
 How terrible ! 
 I really don't want to go into the world , I feel afraid of it . 
 I know . 
 OK , please . 
 I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants . 
 How old are your children ? 
 I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . 

Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson . 
 Good to meet you , Mr Chettri . 

We should keep Frank at arm's length . 
 He hits below the belt . 

Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . 
 Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible 
 What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . 
 But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! 
 Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . 
 Temple fair ? 
 Sounds interesting ! 
 I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? 
 Great ! Do you know how to get there ? 
 Couldn't be better . 
 Frank has gone out with Lucy again . 
 Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know . 
 You are kidding . 
 Although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates . 
 It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 
 It is the Colorado River . You will go down the river in a boat if you wish . 
 There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . 
 It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 

How is Tom now ? 
 Let's congratulate him on Sunday . 
 He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ? 
 It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . 
 You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer . 

What did you say ? 
 Then he become angry with you ? 

I would back him up to the hilt anyway . 
 He's my brother . 
 Thanks for your belief . 
 Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! 
 I hope it will be of some use . 
 Yeah , she has a lot of homework . 
 Right . So in some way we are happier . 

Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . 
 Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . 
 It's normal . Time will change everything . 
 Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . 
 It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . 
 You mean Lily's boyfriend ? 
 Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . 
 We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him . 
 Of course not . Let's talk to him in a very friendly way . 
 I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . 

If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . 
 Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . 
 Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . 
 OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . 
 Because I like him . 

It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . 
 If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . 

Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ? 
 Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ? 
 Do you hike or fish on your trips ? 
 Did you catch anything ? 
 How about Joining our summer camp next week ? 

Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J 
 But it's unfair for Jane . 
 I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . 
 I am all set . He can come anytime . 
 Not so good . I have a terrible cold . 
 Yeah , you're right . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Ugh ! 
 I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . 
 I see . OK . 
 Yeah . 
 I have found myself a date mate . 
 A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . 
 I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . 
 Because everyone is trying to butter him up . 
 Not very well . He was white about the gills . 
 Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . 
 I don't know the reason . 
 Yeah , it happened a week ago . 
 Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . 
 I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . 
 Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . 
 For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . 
 Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . 

Are you going to the party on Saturday ? 
 Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . 
 It starts at 8 
 Everyone from school . 
 This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . 
 So am I going to see you at the party ? 

Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? 
 We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . 
 We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . 
 We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . 
 Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! 

What are you doing this weekend ? 
 I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . 
 Would you be interested in joining me ? 
 I thought that we could leave around 8 
 That was part of my plan . 

Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? 
 I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . 
 Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . 
 Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . 
 Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . 

Joe , how are you doing ? 
 I am free that night , and a party sounds good . 
 I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ? 
 I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK . 
 Would you like some help with the food ? 

It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 

Welcome , Ron , come on in ! 
 We enjoy it too ! 
 About four years now . 
 Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink . 
 I have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice . 

Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . 
 How long has it been since we last saw each other ? 
 What have you been doing for the past two years ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 You should easily be able to find a job with that major . 

Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So do I . 
 Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . 
 How is everything going on ? 
 You look prettier than before . 

It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 

It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? 
 Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? 
 Yes . 
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
 In London.Where do you live ? 

Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? 
 Not bad thanks . 
 Bye ! 
 I like spring . 
 Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . 

What happened ? 
 Let's stop and have a look . 
 I'm curious about that . 

It's too hot to read . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 How about summer ? 
 Why ? 
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
 It's going to rain . 

John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? 
 It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . 

When were you born may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am afraid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 It was funny . 
 Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight . 
 Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . 
 We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . 
 Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . 
 Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . 
 I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . 
 I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . 
 There is a square in front of us . We can park the car there . 
 I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too . 
 Yeah . I do it once a week . 
 Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . 

I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . 
 No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . 
 Is it just a bus ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . 
 Is it a horror movie ? 
 No way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ? 
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . 
 Yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 The Notebook is this type of movie . 
 Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . 

I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . 
 Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . 

How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? 
 It's very expensive , right ? 
 Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? 
 Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . 
 No problem . I'll tell you . 

There is something wrong with my girlfriend . 
 The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . 
 Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . 

Jane , pleases come with us . 
 Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? 
 But ... OK . 
 He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . 
 But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . 
 Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . 

I told you that she is no fool . 
 She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . 

Has the chief accepted our plan ? 
 Let ’ s have a try . 
 Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? 
 Are you going to have a birthday party ? 

Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 

Who's singing in your home , Jim ? 
 Who's Ellie ? 
 Oh , I see.how old is she ? 
 I suppose they're playing games . 
 Today . 
 Yes . 
 Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? 
 About 6:00 . 

My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . 
 What is it ? 

Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? 
 Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? 
 Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . 

Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? 
 Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ? 

Are you alright , child ? 
 What did the nurse say ? 
 In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . 
 Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 At school . And I'm still learning it now . 
 About three years . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . 
 Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . 
 It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . 
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? 
 Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . 
 Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . 
 Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . 
 Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . 
 Right . What are you going to do tonight ? 
 On a Friday night ? 

Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 Why don't you sit in the back with me ? 
 By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is . 
 R-I-N ? 
 I got it . Mary Lin . 

Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
 Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary . 

If you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well . 
 You want a bet ? 

Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 
 A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . 
 No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . 
 Can you say it again slowly ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll have to sink about it . 
 Oops . I meant , " think " 
 I know . 

Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? 
 Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . 
 A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . 
 Not yet . 
 How was your day ? 
 Anybody I know ? 
 Of course . You didn't have to ask me . 
 Just don't stay out too late . 
 I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom . 
 But I still have to tell her . 
 Tell you what , give me your phone number . 
 Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday . 
 We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . 
 But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
 I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest . 
 Ah , I ’ m going to the pub to watch the football . 
 Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock . 

When ’ re you getting married ? 
 Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? 
 That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? 
 Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . 
 What ? 
 Is it ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . 
 You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . 
 Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . 
 Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . 
 Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . 
 He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . 

They promised us a sea view . 
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 

Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? 
 Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower . 
 What else did you see ? 
 You must have had a great time . 
 Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you . 
 That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 

Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget.Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 

You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? 
 With the job ? 
 A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . 

Hello , Pam . 
 It looks like there are a lot of people inside . 
 Should I take my shoes off ? 
 Where are your parents ? 
 That's great ! 
 No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 
 You mean visit a factory ? 
 Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
 Really ? What do the companies do that for ? 
 Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
 Do we need an appointment beforehand ? 

Don't just stand outside . Come on in . 
 This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . 
 Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team . 
 That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ? 
 Come on . I'll introduce you two . 
 Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 
 Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
 Thanks ! 
 I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . 
 Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ? 
 Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . 
 That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . 
 It seems you two bring out the best of one another . 
 Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . 

Hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 
 It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . 
 Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 What is it ? 
 That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . 
 1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m . 
 Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . 

Hi , Michael , how's it going ? 
 I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? 
 Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? 
 Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . 
 Oh come on , it's not that bad . 
 Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . 
 Good luck . 
 Very romantic ? 
 You married him for that reason ? 

Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . 
 Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 
 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 

Do you feel better ? 
 Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine . 

It is too bad today . 
 My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . 
 It was the police wo helped me to do that . 

Did you get the car you wanted ? 
 What about the car over there ? 

Today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding . 
 Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Shift it a little before you get up . 

Tim ’ s smiles are interesting . 
 You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . 

What's this , I wonder ? 
 A coffee grinder ? 
 Oh , that would be very useful . 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 I heard it might rain . 
 Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead . 
 Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . 

Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 

Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 

Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 

Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . 
 Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . 

Hey , where's Cindy ? 
 You're Mary , right ? 
 Cindy told me about you in our gym class . 
 My house is next door to yours . 
 Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . 
 I think you'd better apologize . 
 Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She is a grow-up . She can make her own decision . 

Well , everything is packed and ready to go . 
 Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - 
 Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . 
 Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . 
 If only we could eat there once more ! 
 Hope the restaurant is still there . 
 Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . 

Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 

Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 
 Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . 
 There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
 That would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
 My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon ! 
 You're welcome . Maybe next time we'll come to see you . 
 I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit . Oh , what's your flight number ? 
 They just announced the boarding call . 
 OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing . 
 Bye . 
 Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . 
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
 Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . 
 Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . 
 It seems you have to take time . 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 Who ? 
 That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . 
 Ok . 
 It's all yours . 
 Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you . 
 You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use . 
 Kind of . It leads to my bedroom . 

Matthew ? Hi ! 
 It's got to be almost a year now . 
 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
 Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
 Mrs . Thou ? 
 Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 

Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? 
 Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . 

What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today . 
 No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ? 

How is Jim recently ? 
 Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet . 
 It ’ s still touch and go . We don ’ t see how she can make it . 

What is wrong with Peter ? He sure looks unhappy . 
 How foolish he is . The girl is inviting . She often makes a pass at boys . 

John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? 
 I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . 
 I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films . 

Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . 
 Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . 

I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . 
 It's sounds like fun . 
 I want to try something exciting . 
 I'll tell you all about it next Monday . 

I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them . 
 You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone . 
 I know , I know . But someone took offence . 
 Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . 
 Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . 
 Ok , I ’ ll try my best . 
 You were showing respect and admiration for them . 

What shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
 That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
 I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . 
 Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? 
 Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? 
 Any other ideas ? 
 It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
 Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here 
 Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . 
 Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . 
 Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . 
 That's because Americans love sitcoms . 
 Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . 
 I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . 
 Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . 
 No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . 
 Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! 
 Yes I have . I went to the table tennis yesterday . 
 Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? 
 Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road . 

What happened to you yesterday ? 
 Oh I see . So that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ? 
 Oh dear , that sounds terrible . 
 Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . 
 Thank you . My husband gave it to me . 
 Yes I am . I got married five years ago . 
 No , we met at university . 
 Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven ’ t slept much at all . 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right ! 
 We were in the same science class last term . 
 I did . 
 It was no big deal . 
 They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend . 

Is Jack still staying idle everyday ? 
 Really ? He is so competent now . 

Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ? 
 At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang . 
 It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . 

Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? 
 Brad Bush ? Good for you ! 
 You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? 
 Until college ? 

I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . 
 Angry ? Why would I be ? 
 Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . 
 Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . 

What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You're right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . 
 One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . 
 The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . 
 And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . 
 Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! 
 Yeah , I guess so . 
 Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . 
 Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . 

Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? 
 I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that . 
 Well how about meeting at my place ? 

So do you think you can get to the office alone ? 
 Do you think the taxi driver will understand you ? 
 Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ? 

What's your favorite book ? 
 Why do you like it best ? 
 Well . I like the Thorn Birds best . 
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 

What's that book you have under your arm ? 
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 
 If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . 
 Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 
 Don ’ t worry . It ’ s only a cold . 
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 

Where are you going this weekend ? 
 Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? 
 I see . What ’ s it like there ? 
 Well , have a great time ! 
 Do you ? 
 Do you watch it or do you still play it ? 

My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . 
 I cannot have the heart to do that . 
 Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . 
 But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . 

I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer . 
 He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too . 
 Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . 
 I washed my car instead . 
 No I didn ’ t . I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband . 
 Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family . 
 We watched lots of television and films . 
 Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine . 

What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? 
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
 How ’ s your son these days ? 
 He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . 
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . 
 It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
 He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 

How long have you been in England ? 
 Almost two years ? Your English is very good . 

Lovely day , isn't it ? 
 You are not English , are you ? 

I don't think we've met . 
 My name is Dick Brown . 
 Mr . Smith often talked about you . 
 I'm honored to know you . 
 Sure . What do you expect to know ? 
 And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum . You can stay there for at least a whole day . 
 The night life there . It's so romantic ! 
 I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . 

What are you doing this weekend ? 
 So you ’ re free on Saturday night ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me ? 
 Perfect . I ’ ll pick you up then . 
 Oh yes , I ’ Ve been to Britain many times . I go there on business . 
 Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year . 
 I ’ m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ’ s always business . 
 Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . 
 Great , let's go . 
 En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it . 
 The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... 
 That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time . 

Are you free this evening , Li ? 
 What a pity . I wanted to go for a drink with you . 
 No , I haven ’ t got any plans . 
 Why not ? Sounds good to me . 
 No , I haven ’ t . This is the first time I have been to China . 
 To be honest , I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t been to the states but I have been to Canada . 
 Oh , I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired . 
 I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired . 
 Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace . 

Hi Amy , you look very happy . 
 Wow . You must be very excited . 
 Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? 
 Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . 

Susan , good evening . Why are you so dressed up ? 
 You look great . Your make-up is perfect . 
 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 
 With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect . 
 Not much , just a house party with some friends . 
 Yeah , most of the people are from our office . 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll have fun no matter where you go . Remember to take your bag . 
 Where else haven't we been to yet ? 
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ? 
 Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense ! 
 Enough ! I can't wait anymore . 
 That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 
 Do you prefer brandy or ports . 
 Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 
 Yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
 Oh , what's that ? 
 Why not ? It sounds great . 
 Thanks . Cheers . 

You look happy . 
 Wow ! Is it a good car ? 
 Was it expensive ? 
 What colour is it ? 

The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? 
 That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? 
 Yeah . I think I can find it . 
 That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . 
 Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . 

What's Beijing like ? 
 What can I see in Beijing ? 
 What ’ s it like ? 

Wei , you look really tired . 
 9:00 ! 
 Why ’ s that ? 

What does your sister look like , Mike ? 
 Is she like you ? 
 Is she as clever as you ? 
 Big head ! 
 I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . 
 Can I bring my camera with me ? 
 I sure will . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . 
 I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . 
 I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . 
 Maybe you are right to some extent . 
 Maybe I could have a try . 
 I've been away on a vacation . 
 Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends 

When is your vacation going to start ? 
 Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ? 
 Where are you going now . 
 Have you made your hotel reservation yet ? 
 You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August 

I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain . 
 I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child 

So you're traveling around the world , aren't you . 
 When did you arrive here ? 
 Did you have a good journey ? 
 Where have you been on this trip ? 
 Really ? How long will your holiday last ? 
 All these countries in two weeks ? 

We're lucky today . 
 Where's Hyde Park ? 
 That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays , isn't it ? 
 Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there . 
 Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating . 
 August 1st . 
 Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . 
 We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . 
 Well , I don't know . 
 So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ? 

Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? 
 I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ? 
 No , once I fill the tub with beer , I'll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . 
 Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne . 
 White , please 
 I don't like Folk music very much . 
 I like classical music . Do you ? 
 I don't believe you . 
 You are funny ! 

Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now . 
 I ’ m so sorry . 

The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . 
 Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . 

How are you tonight , sir ? 
 I know what you mean . What can I get for you ? 
 One screwdriver , coming right up . ( He mixes the drink . ) Here you are , sir . 

Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? 
 Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . 
 Sure . Bring enough films , please . 

Good evening . I've come to see Miss Morrison 
 Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents 
 But you're busy , aren't you ? 
 I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ? 

Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ? 
 So you don't travel a lot now ? 
 It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . 
 I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? 
 Well , every stamp has a story to tell . 
 Good . 
 There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . 
 Ok , good luck . See you 

My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday 
 She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt . 
 We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon 

What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . 
 Oh , that's really tough . 
 I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? 
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 

How have you been ? 
 And how ’ s everyone in your family ? 
 I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . 
 It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? 
 Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? 
 Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . 
 He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . 
 Anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . 
 No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . 
 So do I . 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 You can ask her out for drink after work . 
 Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . 
 You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . 
 That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . 
 Good luck . 
 I am always on the look out for such girls . 
 Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . 
 Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ? 
 I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ? 
 The film will start at 2 
 In my parking lot , at 2pm . 

Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? 
 Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . 
 Is everything ready now ? 
 Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
 It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
 My pleasure . 
 Are you serious ? 
 But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 But I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... 
 I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . 
 Shall we keep pur friendship ? 

Hello ? 
 Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now . 
 Why not ? 
 Thanks . I could eat a cow . 
 Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office . 
 And a company car . 
 Yes , it is . But I ’ Ve got a lot of work too . 

What happened , John ? 
 Why do you look unhappy ? 
 Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . 

You look pale , you must have poor health . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 

Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . 
 Then what shall we do ? 

You look pale recently . 
 Take good care of yourself . 

Hello ? 
 I ’ Ve no idea . Nothing really . 
 Wonderful . 
 I ’ ll be ready . 
 Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . 

Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 
 Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . 

I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . 
 Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . 

Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
 I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . 

It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? 
 What did you do to get his goat ? 

Henry , don ’ t get out of doing housework . 
 You mean that is my business . 
 I ’ m your wife , not a housewife . I have my own work . 

I learned of the railway accident only this morning . 
 Is that true ? 
 Thanks . 
 Because it was her husband who beat her . 
 She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . 
 He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
 So are Copernicus and many others . 
 I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 

You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
 Where did you spend your holiday ? 

What did the boss say to you ? 
 Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 

My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
 John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . 
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . 
 I'll beat him . 

What did he say ? 
 It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . 

You married Joe , didn't you ? 
 I remember you are in love . 
 It's Greek to me . 
 So the reform cannot be carried out well . 
 Easier said than done . 
 He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . 
 He ran four miles and came back dead beat . 

I think that ’ s settled . 
 How dare you speak to me like this . 

Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . 
 It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 

I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 

Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . 
 What ? Beg your pardon . 
 I just cann't believe my ears ! 
 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 
 Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . 
 You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . 
 Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . 
 He deserved it . 
 Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . 
 This situation isn't easy to handle . 
 It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . 

It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . 
 I am not certain about that . 

Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 
 Really ? 

They got a divorce at last . 
 You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . 

Why are you so rude to your wife ? 
 But she means to help you , not to trouble you . 

What will happen to the children if you break up ? 
 Why don't you make up with John . 

A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . 
 He must be regretting about having done the business . 

Hurry up ! Time is money ! 
 But you are too slow to follow them . 

I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . 
 If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . 

Hi , what ’ re you reading ? 
 No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished . 
 Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . 
 It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 He didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 
 Thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . 

You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What is your current occupation ? 
 Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? 
 Do you like your current job ? 

How was the movie last night ? 
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
 She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . 
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
 It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 You're dancing so well . 
 When did you learn to dance ? 
 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 Thank you for the dance . 
 OK . 
 Hey , Isabelle ... 
 Yes , I am the guy . 
 Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! 
 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
 I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . 
 Waiting for someone . 
 You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . 
 Well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . 
 Yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
 I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . 

We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 

What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . 
 Come on , nothing can be that bad . 
 Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? 
 Really ? Is he married ? 
 Then what's your problem ? 
 Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . 
 Office romance is very tricky . 
 Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . 
 I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . 
 Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . 
 He borrowed it from Nick . 
 He was too desperate to find some other way . 
 Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . 
 Ah , it ’ s hard to say . 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 Don't you know they've already broken up ? 
 And he's so handsome . 
 Yes , I watched once . 
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form . 
 Really ? Good for you . 
 You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ? 
 Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . 
 She is expecting . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ? 
 So shall we have lunch together ? I ’ d like to take you this time . 
 How come ? 
 All right . Can we make it another time ? 
 I ’ ll call you later . Bye . 

The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . 
 And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 

What ? You golden watch is lost ? 
 It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . 

Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? 
 But he seems to be very happy with Rose . 

Tom has grown six inches within a year . 
 Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . 

How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! 
 Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . 
 He's after your own heart , it is important . 
 I promise ! 
 Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . 

A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again . 
 A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ? 

Susan has got the cancer of stomach . 
 Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . 
 Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . 
 But he's really kind at heart . 

It seldom rains this summer . 
 Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . 
 It is serious . 
 I suspect it's unavoidable . 
 Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . 
 How do you know that ? 
 Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . 
 That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them . 

All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth . 
 The neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs . 
 Really ? That's a straws in the wind . 
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 

Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? 
 OK . 
 Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? 

Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . 
 Yeah , you have some other ideas ? 
 For example ? 
 Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . 
 Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
 I lived in England when I was a child . 
 Well , I know a little Italian . 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 

What's his job ? 
 But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . 

Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 

How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 

Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s the anniversary of our weeding . 
 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
 But she did and made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 

Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old McDonald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . What ’ s more , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 

Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 

What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . 
 It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ? 

John got a heart attack last night . 
 Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . 

He has a girlfriend already . 
 His new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . 

Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . 
 He is too scared to ask her . 

I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree . 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 

I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 
 I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . 
 Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . 
 No . Please sit down . 
 Are you also going to Beijing ? 
 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 
 Really ? What did you think ? 
 Was it that crowded ? 
 Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 That's fate . 
 Maybe this is God's will . 
 Hi , Nancy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . 
 Yes , I ’ m going to take a holiday tomorrow . 
 That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? 
 Oh . All right I'll read it soon . 
 It's nothing Nancy . 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 

What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 

Is there anything wrong ? 
 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . 
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
 Oh , she can make her own decisions . 
 I really couldn't understand him . 
 We'd better also leave him alone . 
 Yes , she does . She works at home . 
 Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . 

I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . 
 Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . 

I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide . 
 I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . 
 I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . 
 Yes , I did . 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . 
 What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . 

Doesn't she have any friends ? 
 Such friends are even worse than enemies . 

I think modern painting means nothing . 
 Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? 
 Maybe . 
 No , have they had another fight ? 
 You must be joking . Those two ? 
 So when did this all happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 Excuse me , what did you say ? 
 That's incredible . I can't believe it . 
 How amazing ! 
 I suppose I do . 
 You said it . 
 It sure is . 
 Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much . 
 That's for sure . 
 Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . 
 I'm not sure . Medium I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . 
 Black or dark brown . 
 Straight , I think , and about average length 

What do you think of doctor Thompson ? 
 How can you be so sure ? 
 Never believe his words . 
 Yeah , you can count on it . 
 I like him . He's good for her . 

Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam . 
 Congratulations on your success . 

If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? 
 Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . 
 You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
 Oh , how did you deal with it ? 
 Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? 
 Like what ? 
 Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . 
 So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 
 So does my father . I'm already used to it . 
 How dare you say that ? What they do is just for our good . 

Who did the stupid thing ? 
 I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that . 

I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? 
 And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? 
 Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . 
 But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? 

Nice to see you , Patrick . 
 Yeah . All of us tried our best . 
 Thanks . 
 Great . My family came to visit me . 
 My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . 
 I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? 
 Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 Do you get along well with each other ? 
 You are very lucky to have such a nice family . 

Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 

Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 

You ’ re all set now ? 
 Really , it was nothing . 
 I was happy to help . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 

When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does 6,30 suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 Oh , that sounds great ! 
 Yes , that would be perfect . 
 Yes . Thank you for inviting me . 
 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 
 That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . 
 What ’ s it for ? 
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 

Are you doing anything tonight ? 
 Do you like western music ? 
 There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? 

I decided to go for this kind of life . 
 I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 

Hi , how are you doing ? 
 Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ? 
 Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 
 It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . 
 Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too . 
 Oh , that's too short-lived . 
 II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage . 
 In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . 

Hello , Deva , how are you ? 
 Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . 
 You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . 
 We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . 

I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . 
 I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . 
 Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 Why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 What question ? 
 You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . 
 I---I don ’ t feel like saying it 
 To be honest , I wouldn't . 
 Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . 
 My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
 Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . 
 But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . 
 You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . 
 I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . 

We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 

Do you know Sally ? 
 Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . 

I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . 
 Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one . 
 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 
 And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . 
 How ’ s your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? 

You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 How did he make a fortune ? 

I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 

I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 

Why did Tom quit his job ? 
 If he doesn't change his attitude toward work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . 
 My feeling's exactly . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You are absolutely right . 

Whatever we do , we should do it above board . 
 Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels . 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 

The baby is crying again . 
 How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . 

Mary , I have something to tell you . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . But I think I must tell you . 
 John made out with other girls at the party yesterday . 
 You mean you suspect him . 
 I hope I can do something for you . 
 You are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ? 
 Yes . 
 Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . 
 But now you are rich . 
 This is ordinary marriage life . 
 He has been keeping bach after divorce . 
 Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . 
 Yeah . I like it , Dad . 
 Really ? 
 I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures . 

This one looks great ! I love the seashore . 
 And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ? 
 Yeah ... me , too . 
 Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach . 
 Neither do I . Let's stay in a cabin.It ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean . 
 Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . 
 He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . 
 Good morning , John ! 
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? 
 I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? 
 That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . 
 What is wrong with you ? 
 You can talk with him . 
 Nice to meet you , I'am Simon . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . 
 What do you do there ? 
 I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . 
 Yes , That's him over there - the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ? 

I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . 
 I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . 
 No , thank you . 
 It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . 
 When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . 
 I appreciate that , thank you . 
 What is a tornado warning ? 
 Really ? In New Berlin ? 
 I understand . They think a tornado might come . 
 And the second stage is called a tornado warning . 
 It's scary . 
 What do you mean a loud train ? 
 But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 
 Have you seen a lot of them ? 
 Did it hit their house ? 
 What were they doing when you called ? 
 That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? 

Hello . Is this Ann ? 
 Yes , it's me . 
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . 
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . 
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever . 
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . 

Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
 There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
 I think my arm is broken . 
 Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . 
 I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? 
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
 It really hurts . 
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
 To hell with you . 
 Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! 
 I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . 
 Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you . 

I have some good news for you . 
 Jenny is getting married . 
 Tom , that lucky guy . 
 Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . 
 July 4 , the National Holiday . 
 Jenny plans to hold it in church . 
 Guess ! 
 You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running . 
 As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . 
 Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . 
 Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . 
 I'd like both . 
 The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . 
 They usually do . 
 Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? 
 Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ? 
 Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ? 
 Oh , I'll try to catch it . 
 Thank you.But does it really look all right ? 
 Then does it go well with my sweater ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 How beautiful the detached house is ! 
 It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . 
 No wonder it smells fragrant . 
 It's fantastic ! 
 Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ? 
 Would you like tea or coffee ? 
 Here you are . 
 That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ? 
 No . I'm just killing time . 
 Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks.When shall we start ? 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . 
 Yeah , We're buddy-buddy still . 
 Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times . 
 Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people . 
 Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying he's like that all the time . 
 Well , I think you should decide for yourself . 
 Okay , Okay.You can trust him . I was just trying to give you a hard time . 
 Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone . 
 After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? 
 I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . 
 No , why ? 
 She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . 

Do you still see the people we went to school with ? 
 Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . 
 OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . 
 Oh , of course . 
 All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache . 
 No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish . 
 Only since this morning . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Wow , what a lovely cake . 
 Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? 
 Better luck this time . 
 How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages . 
 Pretty busy.So are you back for good ? 
 Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . 
 Same here . 
 Thank you . 
 What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ? 
 Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother . 
 Thank you , Please have a cup of tea . 
 How about some fish ? 
 OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 
 It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . 
 Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight . 
 We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know . 
 Yes , I've always dream of having a big wedding . 
 I don't really enjoy big occasions , but I think I ’ ll come round to the idea in the end , It only happens once in a lifetime . 

Then I'll take them . How much ? 
 Here is $ 150.Keep the change . 
 You too.Bye . 
 It's interesting , I like being an editor . 
 I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . 
 I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . 
 No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? 
 That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 
 Thanks to your help.To our friendship . 
 Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us . 
 I'll surely make introductions for them . 
 Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? 
 No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . 
 What about cab drivers and porters ? 
 You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . 
 Yes . I like it very much . 
 It's excellent . 
 It's delicious . 
 I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? 
 Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . 

My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . 
 My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . 
 My wife will be going back to work soon . 
 Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . 
 Did you enjoy it ? 
 Why ! what happened ? 
 So how long did you stay ? 

It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... 
 Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ... 
 Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown . 
 Would you please be quiet , Ladies and Gentlemen ? 
 Quiet everybody ! 
 It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . 
 I'm sorry . What's your name again ? 
 So Barb ... what do you do ? 
 Really ? Where ? 
 I'm an engineer at IBM . 
 Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . 

Hey , Rose , how are you feeling ? 
 Oh , Look at the baby.It ' s so beautiful.Is it a boy or a girl ? 
 Can I hold it for a moment ? 
 Oh , how adorable ! She's got your eyes . 
 When are you returning home ? 
 You can use some time off.You ' Ve been working too hard anyway . 
 I hope so , too.Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much . 
 But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys . 

Hello . 
 Sure , just a minute.Mark , you're wanted on the phone . 
 Hi ! This is Jill.How come you didn't come in today ? 
 That's too bad.You ' ll have to be more careful nest time . 
 No , nothing special.Oh , yes , you know Bill , The guy with the moustache.His wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today , He said his wife and daughter are doing fine.The baby is their first child . 
 Yes , we have to.Do you think you can make it tomorrow ? 
 You're welcome.Bye . 
 I'm from Canada , originally . 
 Montreal . 
 We moved here when I was fourteen . 
 Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . 
 No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . 
 Let's see ... That was about six years ago . 
 I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? 
 You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? 
 how about I come and see you off ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . 
 Of course . I will . 

Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . 
 That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . 
 How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . 
 Well . I really do have to go . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 America ? Did you get admit to MIT ? 
 Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . 
 Really going to miss you . 
 Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey . 
 Look after yourself . Bye . 

How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . 
 May I know your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes . I remember now.Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? 
 I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft.How are things with you ? 
 May I know what you do ? 
 Sure.That would be great.Good luck . 

Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall . 
 Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ? 
 Where did you go ? 
 What did you think of Tokyo ? 
 Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds ! 
 And how about Kyoto ? 
 How was the weather ? 
 Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! 
 I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . 
 Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . 
 After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . 
 Yeah . I went to California to study . 
 I was there between 88 and 90 . 
 Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . 
 I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came . 
 I love the museums , too . 
 Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy . 
 I can't stand making decisions . You choose ! 

Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? 
 It's been a long time ! What's new ? 
 Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . 
 I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . 
 Ok , I won't keep you then . 
 Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! 
 Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . 
 Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . 
 It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . 
 Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . 
 Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . 
 Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry ! 
 Don't worry , I'll drive you . 
 How are your cases coming along ? 
 Wow , Good for you.It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ? 
 You're welcome.Good luck , bye ! 

Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . 
 Let me show you the way . Please follow me . 
 My pleasure . 
 It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . 
 The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time . 
 That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries . 
 Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting . 
 Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada . 

Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? 
 Well , Rose , 
 Are your free this weekend ? 
 Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? 
 I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . 
 Is 5 PM . a good time for you ? 
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 
 I'll be there on time . 
 Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . 
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
 Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . 
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . 
 I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . 
 I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? 
 Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . 
 You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? 
 You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . 

Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . 
 Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . 
 I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? 
 Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . 
 OK . 
 Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . 
 I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! 
 That's right , I have to work hard . 
 A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? 
 I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . 
 i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday . 
 Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . 
 I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . 
 Nothing really , why , what ' s up ? 
 Sounds great , i ' d very much like having something thanks , when ? 
 Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . 
 Ok , I will see you again . 

I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now . 
 Who do you mean ? 

I hear that Mary got mad . 
 What ’ s wrong with her ? 

It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . 
 What can we do ? 

Hi charles , I want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian . 
 Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? 
 Around seven . 
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 
 Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about six thirty . 

Betty was in hospital . 
 She suffers from cancer . 

Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ? 
 That it easy.They get caught before they come here . 

The country is strong only in appearance . Don ’ t you think so ? 
 You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact . 
 He is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time . 
 Believe me , he is the first-class . 
 You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . 
 But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . 
 They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . 

Hi , Kenji . 
 I'm OK . How are you doing ? 
 Do you mean The Bangkok ? 
 Sure , I'd love to . 
 Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me.Oh ! I'm late ! I have a class . 
 Great . Talk to you then . 
 Speaking . 
 Of course . How're you ? 
 I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . 
 Yeah . I really like Lesley . 
 Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ? 
 That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show . 
 See you at seven fifteen , Saturday . 
 Oh , darling , we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music . I know you can pull yourself together . 
 Cheer up . You have got me at least . 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Mothers like that . 
 What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog . 

We must set 1000 dollars aside each month . 
 We are going to buy our own house . 

You are in love with Mary , right ? 
 I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . 
 Oh , would you please turn off the fire ? My hands are sticky with the dough . 
 Thanks . 
 When ? I saw him well last month . 
 How terrible ! 
 What is the matter ? 
 That is to say , love is blind . 
 I will be hanged if I lying . 
 My car run out of petrol . 
 I have a severe headache now . 
 Would you like to go with me ? I ’ m afraid of the hospital . 
 What ? You have been in love for six years , haven ’ t you ? 
 What a pity . 
 My mother is ill in the hospital . 
 The disease fails to respond to drugs . 
 Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . 

Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . 
 You will ask for it . 

Jenny is going to marry another man next month . 
 But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much . 

Have you met John recently ? 
 Yes , he has been like that since his accident . 

Mary , I heard you moved again . 
 You mean noise ? How could it be ? 

What is up ? 
 Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . 

Mike promised to help us . 
 Why not ? 

Mary is such a cautious girl ! 
 She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others . 

He told the police that Ted was the murderer . 
 Why do you say so ? 

Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? 
 I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . 
 Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ? 
 Don ’ t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him . 
 Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks . 

I want to try my hand at the stocks . 
 Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard . 

What did you say when she told you the news ? 
 But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that . 

He is penny wise and pound-foolish . 
 The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . 

Who broke the glass , Peter ? 
 I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam . 

How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! 
 I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . 
 So ? 
 You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself . 

Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . 
 You know why ? 

Can you believe that Susan got married ? 
 No . That ’ s what is surprising me . 
 He ’ s a postman . 

In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . 
 I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . 
 Yeah . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 I have some problem with my work . 
 I can solve it , thanks . 
 Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . 
 Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . 
 The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . 

She has contributed to a new school . 
 I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments . 
 She said she would name it after her father . 

I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on . 
 I appreciate your kindness . 
 He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . 
 Whatever things get tough , he gives in . 
 Really ? How do you know that ? 
 Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ? 

Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ? 
 I think it ’ s time for the government to take strong action . And people should try to protect environment . 

Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ? 
 By the way , are you going to the concert tomorrow ? 

The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment . 
 Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood . 

I don ’ t dare to look after the children now . 
 The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them . 

I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . 
 But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . 

Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? 
 You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 

What happened to your brother ? 
 Your parents must be worrying about him . 
 Have you talked to him ? 

I ’ m sure you never dare to go against your wife . 
 Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ? 
 Well , it ’ s nice to have a husband like you . 
 Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . 
 Why should we run after the fashion ? 

I heard you are busy with your new house now ? 
 Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house ? 
 But it is far from downtown . Living here is very inconvenient . 

Mary has really gotten under my skin . 
 I think I ’ m crazy about her . 

The government has to face a lot of social problems now . 
 But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . 

I am very proud of John . 
 But he has suffered a lot . 
 Your dream comes true now . 
 You are really confident . 
 Is he ? He ’ s never been healthy . 
 I ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . 
 We all know that . Her husband always make a fuss of her . 

The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends . 
 But you know , things cannot always go as you expect . 

It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . 
 Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . 

Do you know that Jack got divorced last month . 
 Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family . 

I can look anybody in the face because I ’ Ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . 
 You are flattering me . 
 You mean he had been put in prison before . 
 Oh , he had fooled me . 
 That ’ s understandable . Every kid likes new clothes . 

Where are you going ? 
 What ’ s the matter ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How are things now ? 

Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . 
 Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . 
 Maybe he is on the way home now . 
 That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see . 

Have you met John ? 
 Have you noticed how fluently he speaks English ? He has only lived in America for less than three months . 

It is time to butter him up . 
 I don ’ t know . Let me see . 

You had better get a grab instead of getting upset about little things . 
 I think as long as you try your best and don ’ t think of anything too much , everything will be all right . 
 If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course . 
 Yeah . Love me , and love my dog . 
 Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it ! 
 I think Mary must be sad , because she loves her husband very much . 
 How did you know that ? I heart Tom ’ s father didn ’ t agree with that . 
 It ’ s great . Although his father didn ’ t agree with that , Tom went through with it . 

Do you think I should ask Bob to help ? Will he come ? 
 That ’ s right . But I have bothered him several times . 

Do you think people still have faith in the government ? 
 Why is that ? 
 So it is no wonder people cannot keep faith with it . 
 I hear that his father died . 
 He is out of luck . 
 What did he aim at ? 
 How could he have such an ill intention ? I think your father can see that through . 
 Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . 

Where can I get the information , Kate ? 
 Why ? 

What are you worrying about ? 
 Where is he ? Is he in danger ? 

Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . 
 I have a big date tonight . 
 Oh , please . Only once lend your new car to me . 
 Yes . 
 It is really a hard nut to crack . The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace . 
 Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . 

There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . 
 Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . 
 Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . 
 I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . 
 But I think time can change everything . 
 This is the result of women ’ s liberation . 
 I have no idea . 
 Yes ? Anything I can do for you ? 
 Ok . 
 Not because I ’ m keeping an eye on the baby . 
 She is at the supermarket downstairs . She said she would be back in about half an hour . 
 Sorry , Mr . Black . I ’ m trying to make them quiet . 
 Sorry , sir . Believe me , everything will be all right . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . 

Hi , Peter . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t make it to dinner tomorrow night . 
 It ’ s just I ’ m not feeling well . I think I ’ m coming down with a cold or something . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 Yes , we are . 
 In the spring . 
 Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
 Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in . 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 Yes , I packed it myself . 
 It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . 

Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? 
 I'm fine too , thank you . 
 With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? 
 What's on the program ? 

Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 
 I only paid two dollars for mine . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you , John . 

How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 But I ... I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills . 
 They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets . 

It ’ s time for me to go now . 
 I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
 I ’ d rather you typed it . 
 I ’ d rather you told her . 
 Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . 
 Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? 
 Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . 
 I will . Thank you , dad . 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 Is this the sign ? What does it says ? 

How was the movie last night ? 
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
 She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . 
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . 

Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 

Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 

What ’ re you doing now ? 
 You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . 
 And don ’ t ever forget it . 
 Terrible . 
 I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . 
 I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . 
 Yeah , I guess I should . 
 Thank you very much . 

Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 

I am so busy today . 
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
 Or maybe make the beds . 
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 

You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? 
 I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . 
 I don ’ t believe that . 
 I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? 
 That ’ s your opinion not mine . 
 Yes , I watched once . 
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form . 
 Really ? Good for you . 
 Thank you . No . I ’ m late for dinner at my house . I really have to go . 
 I ’ d appreciate that . 
 Thanks . 
 Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? 
 Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . 
 Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I think the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Really ? 
 By air of course . 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 

What do you make of the case ? 
 What do you mean by saying so ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 

Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 

Oh , hi , Lily . When did you get back from Canada ? 
 How was it ? 
 Well , tell me . What are they like ? 

Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ? 
 See you tonight then . 

You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . 
 You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? 
 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 
 Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . 

Do you like chocolates ? 
 Do you like coffee ? 
 And do you like English food ? 

Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget.Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 
 Sure . I didn ’ t know you like mysteries . 

I went to the doctor yesterday . 
 I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
 He said I ' d got the flu . 
 He told me to stay in bed for ten days . 
 Yes , ten days . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . But I think you ought to . 

Well , thank you.Mr.Parry , for all your information.Just one more question . 
 Do you play any sports or games ? 
 And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? 
 And now ? 
 Well , thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . 

How ’ re you today ? 
 What ’ s the main idea in this essay ? 

I like pop music very much . 
 I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 
 It's us . 
 Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember ? 
 Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . 
 Back to live with my parents.That ' s something else I used to do before we were married.Remember ? 
 I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . 
 At the Gate . 
 Round about seven . 
 Peter.Peter Brown , you know.Don ' t forget to bring the letter . 
 I told you not to forget to bring the letter . 

Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . 
 They're all here . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . 
 What are you doing ? Is anything wrong ? 
 Oh , yes , of course . I'm sorry-I wasn't thinking ... 
 Okay.But our baby has fallen sleep . 
 But where's the switch ? 

Come on ! It's time to go ! 
 Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . 
 Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . 
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! 
 Oh , yes , I would ! 
 My father failed in business . 
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . 
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . 
 Thank you . 
 If we hurry , can we get there in time ? 

John got a heart attack last night . 
 Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . 

What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . 
 It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ? 

Don't you think we ' d leave for the concert now ? 
 In about 25 minutes . 

What ? You want to leave early ? 
 Do you really need to ? 
 Is it important ? 
 You really have to ? 
 I guess so . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 

I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ’ ll take actual care of them . I promise you . 
 Oh , that ’ s all right . It ’ s very kind of you . Can I come around now ? 

Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I'm impressed . 

Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Is that so ? 

What would you reckon the taxing increases ? 
 But what do most people think about it ? 

I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . 
 It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . 
 But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money . 
 Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? 
 Why not ? 
 Is that very likely in England ? 

What did you think of the film ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . 
 Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 

There are so many record players here.That is hard to choose . 
 I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . 
 That's right.Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 

How have you been ? 
 And how ’ s everyone in your family ? 
 I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . 
 Really ? Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Be seeing you then . 

Write down your name here in ink . 
 I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . 
 I'm quite out of thoughts recently . 
 I'm worrying about my exam . 

Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . 
 About 7 o'clock . 
 No , not really.Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . 
 Johnson ? I can't place them . 
 They've completely slipped my mind . 
 No , I don't recall a thing about them . 
 Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I ’ m a doctor . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 
 Oh , do you enjoy it ? 

Where do you have to go . 
 When do you have to be there . 
 How long do you have to be there ? 
 When will you be back ? 

Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 

What does she do ? 
 Does she go to night school ? 
 Why ? What does she want to be ? 
 What classes does she take ? 

Hello , Betty , how are you ? 
 Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ? 
 I'm glad to hear that.Bye . 

Hello , Mary . Why are you standing here in the cold wind ? 
 Going for a walk in such a cold weather ? 
 I see . 
 Uh , yes . 
 Yes . I commute five days a week by train . 
 It ’ s really very good . 
 Well , trains are frequent and come on time . 
 I usually take the five thirty home .

How are you ? 
 I haven ’ t seen you for several days . 
 What ’ s he doing ? 
 He must be happy . 
 Fine too . 
 Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ?

Peter , how often do you exercise ? 
 Now , tell me , what do you eat ? 
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 What do you drink ? 
 What do you drink ? 
 No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . 
 I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . 
 I am not surprised , you eat too much . 
 No , I wouldn't think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on the diet ? 
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 

Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 

Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't had much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ?

 A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . 
 My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? 
 Whose house warming party is it ? 
 Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .

 I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . 
 It's super . 
 How about the cinema ? 
 What would you suggest to see ? 

Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
 Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . 
 Oh , we always go to the movies.Can ' t we do something different ? 
 Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .

Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet . 
 How do you do ? 
 What would you like to drink ? 

Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown . 
 My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company . 
 Okay , let ’ s make a toast . 
 Hello , Jack . It ’ s Mary . What are you doing in your office ? 
 Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? 
 What about Saturday ? 
 Will you come round next Tuesday ? 
 What do you say next Wednesday then ? 
 Okay . Bye . 

It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner . 
 This dish is really delicious . 
 You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ? 

Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? 
 Did you ? And what did you study ? 
 Would you mind telling me how old you are ? 
 And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? 
 And what was your salary at the bank ? 

Good evening.Welcome to our program . 
 Would you tell us your name , please ? 
 Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . 
 Where are you from , Ms.Baker ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Thank you for coming , Ms.baker . 
 Good . 
 Do you mean this Saturday ? 
 Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ’ Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ’ t be able to come , I ’ m afraid . 
 Yeah , that ’ s too bad . 

Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ? 
 That ’ s a pity ! Then when would it be a good time for you ? 
 Okay , that ’ s fine . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 Good morning , Miss Bell ! 
 Nice to see you too.It ' s been a long time . 
 Just fine , and you ? 
 Did you drive yourself to the airport ? 
 Did someone meet you at the airport here ? 
 Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? 

What's your favorite book ? 
 Why do you like it best ? 
 Well . I like the Thom Birds best . 
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 

Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 

I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? 
 Who was the conductor ? 
 Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . 
 Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 

Hi , John . What brings you to town ? 
 What do you think of the traffic today ? 
 Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . 

What's that book you have under your arm ? 
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 
 If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . 
 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 

How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? 
 Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . 
 You yourself have a photo studio ? 

Do you know much about computers ? 
 I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now . 
 Yes , but they are used for other things , too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . 
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , I like collecting things . 
 Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on . 
 Yes , stones . 

Hi , Nancy.How are you doing ? 
 Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . 
 You mean used car ? 
 Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problem . 
 It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . 
 Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ? 
 Yes , is that you , Allen ? 
 Not bad . 
 Sure.Thank you very much . 
 Ok , see you . 

Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? 
 Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . 

Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? 
 Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . 

It's a fine day today , isn't it ? 
 How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . 
 Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . 
 Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . 
 The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 

Good afternoon ! 
 I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? 
 Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . 
 What's the weather like in your country ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Here.Near this school . 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 

It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . 
 Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . 
 Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . 
 Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . 
 In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . 
 Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . 
 Well , do you think I have to ? 
 Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
 But I don't think it's so nice . 
 The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . 

Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 
 No , I'm not hungry . 

I think he won't remember White Day . 
 Uh-huh . How about you ? 
 You got a big return for a small gift . 
 No , what's up ? 
 You're joking ! 

Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . 
 Good ! I'm interested in your advice . 
 Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? 
 You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? 
 I agree . I appreciate your helping me . 
 A teacher . 
 I wouldn't like to be a singer , but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing , That dream developed in my mind when I was a child . 
 I'm quite sure . I've always loved working with children . 
 I failed my oral test . 
 I'm not practicing enough . 
 When I talk to Chinese , I always want to speak Chinese . 

You're going to Shanghai tomorrow , are you ? 
 It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year . 
 Not for now , I think , But I believe there'll be rain , so take your raincoat with you . 
 No , thank you . I've given up , you know . 
 Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . 
 Why don't you try and give it up ? 

Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . 
 Good ! I'm interested in your advice . 
 Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? 
 You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? 
 I agree . I appreciate your helping me . 
 Are you married ? 
 Then , you put S in this blank . 
 No , not at all.Go ahead . 
 Yes.Is that so important ? 
 Yes , I have a three-year-old son . 
 I like spring . 
 Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . 

It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 

Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . 
 It's most kind of you . 
 If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . 
 I'm most grateful . 

John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . 
 All right.Are you married ? 
 Then , when do you plan to get married ? 

Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? 
 Do you mean you got a divorce ? 

It's too hot to read . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 How about summer ? 
 Why ? 
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Nothing special . 
 Oh , I'd rather not . 
 You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English . 

Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 

Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ? 
 How about this weekend ? 

I'd like to say good-bye to everyone . 
 My plane leaves at seven twenty-five . 
 Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington . 
 Well , actually , I'm not free today . Do you have anything urgent ? 
 How about tomorrow instead . 
 All right . See you then . 
 When are you off ? 
 Well , good-bye . See you soon . 

I just dropped in to say good-bye . 
 I'm going to try to leave by ten . 
 Good-bye . Hope to see you soon again next year . 

Do you want to go shopping with me ? 
 How about Saturday morning ? 

I'm calling to say good-bye . 
 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
 Goodbye . Thanks again for everything . 
 Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . 
 Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . 
 Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . 
 A new home health monitor . 
 You're kidding ! 
 That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . 
 You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime . 
 Today ? 
 Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you . 
 I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home . 
 Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? 
 You'll recover after a good night's sleep . 
 That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? 
 Don't mention it . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Thank you.Thank you for the trouble you've taken . 

Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? 
 Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . 
 Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it . 

I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor . 
 I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks . 
 I will . It's most thoughtful of you . 
 Was it ? 
 Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . 

Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock . 
 I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that . 
 Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge . 
 I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi ! 
 I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting . 
 Bye . 
 So what ? Are we going anywhere ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ? 
 I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh , I'm glad . 
 No problem . 
 I'm sorry , It's all my fault . 
 Sorry , I had no intention . 
 I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . 
 I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... 
 I can't afford to . 
 Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . 
 Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . 
 It's us . 
 Well , you always say you're busy . 
 And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . 
 Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . 
 Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 Thank you very much . 
 A gold watch ! 
 I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . 
 Oh , thank you so much . 
 I really appreciated it . 
 It was so kind of you . 
 You ’ re a real friend in need . 
 What ’ s it for ? 
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 

Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . 

Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? 
 We can go to that new Chinese restaurant . 
 Come on , let ’ s try it . 

How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 

Look ! It ’ s the start of the Olympic Games . 
 You want to watch , don ’ t you ? 
 Please yourself . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 Good , happy birthday to you ! 
 Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . 

I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening . 
 Helen is nice but she talks a lot . 
 It sure is . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember . 
 I've absolutely certain . 
 I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Quite sure . 
 Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . 
 Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . 
 What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 
 Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? 
 And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . 
 What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . 
 I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
 It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . 
 Sometimes they are too independent . 
 A house warming party ? 
 Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . 
 I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . 
 I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . 
 Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . 
 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
 Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . 
 This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . 
 So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 

I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
 It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . 
 And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 

Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? 
 I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . 
 I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? 
 Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? 
 That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? 
 So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? 

So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 
 That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 
 I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . 
 Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
 My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . 

So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 
 Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . 
 Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . 
 And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . 
 Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . 

Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . 
 Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . 
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 
 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 

Do you have much experience with kids ? 
 To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 
 I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . 
 Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . 

Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? 
 No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? 
 You must have a wonderful time . 
 No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . 

How good are you at sports , Bill ? 
 Wow ! 
 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 

I can ’ t wait to retire . 
 And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! 
 What do you plan on doing after you retire ? 
 I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . 
 Uh ... what game ? 
 Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? 
 Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . 
 Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . 
 Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? 
 It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? 

I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . 
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . 
 It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . 
 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 At least you know what American women generally like in a man . 
 American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . 
 You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . 

Hi , Kate . 
 Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . 
 Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . 

Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! 
 I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . 
 I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . 
 Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! 
 But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? 
 I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . 
 I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . 
 Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . 

Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? 
 Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . 
 You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . 
 But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . 
 It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! 

Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? 
 Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! 
 Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? 
 Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? 
 Feed them ? 
 And then later everyone eats the food ? 
 It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? 
 But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? 

I heard you are going to move . 
 What are you worried about ? 
 You can call a mover . 
 Around 200 RIB for a truck . 
 But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . 
 I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . 
 It ’ s 8357688 8 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? 
 I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . 
 Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? 
 It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . 
 Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . 
 Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . 

Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . 
 It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . 
 Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . 
 I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . 
 What is that ? 
 I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? 
 It ’ me . Susan Taylor 
 On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee . 
 Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done . 
 That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? 

I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . 
 What kind of house is it ? 
 Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . 
 Great , is it a two bedroom house ? 
 That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . 
 Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . 
 Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . 
 Unfortunately , yes . 
 I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . 
 I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . 
 Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . 
 That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ? 
 If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . 
 I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire . 
 I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . 
 So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ? 

So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 
 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
 Yeah , about . 
 Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . 
 I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . 
 I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . 
 Yes , absolutely true . 
 Palmistry ? What is that ? 
 Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . 
 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . 
 What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? 
 What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? 

Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 
 Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . 
 Why can't we ? 
 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
 I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . 
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 

Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! 

What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 

Have you heard about Anlesen David ? 
 No , they got engaged . 
 Well , my dear . I didn't believe either.But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . 
 Next june . 

Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . 
 I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . 
 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 I think you ’ re right ! 
 I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . 
 That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . 
 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
 I suppose I do . 
 You said it . 
 It sure is . 
 Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . 

I'm sorry , but I can't go . 
 I have to see my daughter . 
 I have an appointment at one fifteen . 
 Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . 
 Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 I think so too . It's just pointless . 
 I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . 

Have heard of Paul ? 
 He's got a promotion . 
 No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . 
 Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . 

We scored six goals . 
 And I score three of them . 
 We had extra time of course . 

What do you think of doctor Thomson ? 
 How can you be so sure ? 
 Never believe his words . 
 What did she say ? 
 Really ? I can't believe it . 
 But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl . 
 You can count on it . 
 I like him.He ' s good for her . 

I'm exhausted . My new exercise is so hard . 
 You thing so ? 
 Tomorrow morning.Try it . 
 Are you going to this class this morning ? 
 You're no able to move after this class . 
 You want to bet ? 
 I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
 But Saturday is my birthday . 
 But it won ’ t be on my birthday . 

Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps . 
 But I said thursday.The tickets are for thursday evening . 
 I see.Oh , well some other time perhaps . 

I want to change my job . 
 Well , I want to earn more . 
 Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 

How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 

Morning , Tom . 
 You seem to be in a hurry . 
 Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then . 
 See you later . 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
 Have a nice journey , Lily . 

Nice to see you , Patrick . 
 Yeah . All of us tried our best . 

Are you all right ? 
 Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 

Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time 
 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 
 Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 

Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? 
 You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you , John . 

Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? 
 Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . 

Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 

I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 
 I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . 
 Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . 
 Well . Let ’ s go swimming . 
 Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 
 No , it ’ s my sister . 
 She ’ s 18 . 
 Yes , she is . 
 Well , just a little thin . 
 Oh , what ’ s he like ? 
 Yes . 
 Um , that ’ s good . 

John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . 
 He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . 
 He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . 
 He is in his late thirties . 
 At two thirty . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , she ’ s average . 
 They ’ re dark gray . 
 It ’ s blond . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . 
 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? 
 No , do you want to go and do something ? 
 Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ? 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 Stephany said she would go out with me . 
 That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . 
 We ’ re going fishing . 
 These girls are different , they are not wimpy . 
 When is the last time you talked to you parents ? 
 Are you going to see them soon ? 
 OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ? 

Did you like the party ? 
 Why ? What had you expected ? 

I want take shell on a date , but I don ’ t have much money . 
 She likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . 
 Well , I really like being with her . 
 Dutch , where is that ? 
 Oh , I wonder if she ’ ll go for that . 
 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 I can speak French and German . 
 I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . 
 No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . 
 Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
 I lived in England when I was a child . 
 Well , I know a little Italian . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 But everything has been so easy . 
 Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . 

I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 

Dave , wake up . 
 It's seven-thirty . I want to know who left this note on my desk . 
 It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . 
 It says , Zina , I like how you rhumba . An admirer . 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . 
 At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . 
 Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . 
 Pardon ? 
 Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . 
 Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . 

How do you get paid ? If you don't mind my asking . 
 And in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ? 
 What ? In your cubicle ? 

Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer . 
 I know what you mean . I can't stand computer geeks . 
 Who do you think it is ? 
 Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . 
 Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . 

She is , like , mega-intense , isn't she ? 
 What's it like to work with her ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . 
 I need to be motivated , Vince.Multi - motivated . As in multi-million . 
 Ever hear of WebTracker ? 
 I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich . 

I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . 
 Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . 
 Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... 
 No kidding . Time is running out . 
 Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through . 
 I guess we'll either make it , or we won't . 
 No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ? 
 He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions . 

Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? 
 My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . 
 He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . 

Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . 
 The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina . 
 Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . 
 I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . 
 I was there for almost a year . 
 And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . 
 Almost . 
 Exactly . 
 I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . 
 Hello Todd . 
 Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . 
 The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . 
 I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . 
 Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . 
 What's another Japanese art ? 
 Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . 
 I see . 
 How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? 

OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . 
 What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ? 
 Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot . 
 Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . 
 That's pretty tough ! 
 Hello sir . Good to meet you , too . 
 Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? 
 Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? 
 That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? 
 So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? 
 That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . 
 Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? 
 You miss me , don't you ? 
 OK , I'm in . When do I start ? 

I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... 
 Exactly . 
 How ? 
 But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? 
 Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . 
 Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! 
 Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? 
 Cool ! Teach me ! 
 Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . 

OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! 
 OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? 
 Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? 
 Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? 
 Is that how you feel on the bus ? 
 So , so you're British , do you missing them ? 

This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city . 
 I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . 
 I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that . 
 Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . 

Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . 
 I think he's got too much on his plate . 
 And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... 
 That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . 
 You really should have stayed with us , Dave . 
 Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? 
 What's up with Vince and Elvin ? 
 And they're happy with that ? 

This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . 
 Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . 
 Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . 
 It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? 
 Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? 
 I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 

Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? 
 If I were him , I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money . 

Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . 
 You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . 
 I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act . 
 But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . 
 It was a real red letter day for you . 

Susan is going to get a divorce . 
 She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . 

Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . 
 That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . 
 Who will sing in the show ? 
 Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! 
 Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . 
 But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! 
 You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . 
 Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! 

Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . 
 Yeah , you have some other ideas ? 
 For example ? 
 Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . 
 Really ? That's a straws in the wind . 
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
 At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! 
 It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . 
 Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . 
 No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . 
 Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . 
 For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . 
 That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . 
 That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . 
 That's fate . 
 Maybe this is God's will . 
 We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . 
 But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
 Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . 
 So what do you provide ? 
 How can you get that done ? 
 What else ? 
 Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ? 
 Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . 

Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? 
 Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? 
 well , I can ’ t just imagine it . 
 Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin . 
 It's been 3 years now . 
 How is aunty Shirley ? 
 How has May been ? 

Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . 
 Come on , it's cool outside . 
 Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? 
 What ? Are you crazy ? 
 Ew , Danny , gross ! 
 I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . 

It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 I don't mind at all . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . 
 I don't know . It's still up in the air . 
 We'd better go out for a walk . 
 Spring . 
 I dislike it most . 
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 

What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? 

Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 

Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
 What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 When do you have lunch ? 
 What do you normally eat ? 
 Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . 

Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish . 
 That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . 
 And English is very useful in your job . 
 You will be a very promising one . 

Have you got your invitation yet ? 
 The house warming party . 
 Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . 
 It's out in the suburbs . 
 Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . 
 Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . 
 They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . 
 Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . 

Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? 

Does she make any sense to you ? 
 She's speaking French , not Greek . 
 Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . 

I hear you and James are engaged at last . 
 When are you getting married ? 
 Oh , lovely . Where's the wedding going to be ? 
 Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ? 
 Where are you going to live after you're married ? 
 Are you going to give up your job ? 

Are you a newcomer ? 
 You speak good English , though . 
 But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? 

Can you speak Japanese ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 How long have you been learning it ? 
 Can you speak any other languages ? 

Where are you from ? 
 So you speak German , don't you ? 
 Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? 
 Good . 
 To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . 
 Yes , my first marriage was a failure . 
 Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty . We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? 
 Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? 
 Yes . 
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
 In London.Where do you live ? 

Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 

Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? 
 How much was the ticket ? 

Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . 
 No , I'm not hungry . 

Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? 
 I'm fine too , thank you . 
 With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? 
 What's on the program ? 

Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
 Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? 
 See you . 
 Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby 
 I like taking photos out of door . 
 Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . 
 Yes , simple as it is . t does work . 
 It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . 
 Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . 
 Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Well , do you think I have to ? 
 Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
 But I don't think it's so nice . 
 The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . 

Is there a city where it's always warm ? 
 Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? 
 But why do so many people live there ? 
 Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? 
 Tell us about some cold cities . 
 Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? 

It's a fine day today , isn't it ? 
 How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . 
 Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . 
 Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . 
 The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . 
 Really ? When did that happen ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 

Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? 
 Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . 
 A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . 
 Not yet . 
 We planned our wedding for next May . 
 Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . 
 Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . 

When is your birthday ? 
 Do you usually have a birthday party ? 
 What would you do at the party ? 
 Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? 
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called " Good Morning to you " . But later someone added the words " Happy Birthday " to their tune . 
 Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
 Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? 
 Are you going to have a birthday party ? 

Do you often do exercise ? 
 OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ? 
 You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . 
 Says who ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 I'm a real man , and I like football . 
 I like Renaldo the most . 
 It's Ellie and her friends . 
 She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " . 
 She's ten . 
 Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? 
 Today ? 
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 
 Very much.What time ? 
 I'll be at your house at about five thirty.Happy birthday . 
 Mom , it's orange ? 
 Mom , that's a stupid question . 
 I am not a child at all . I know more . 
 Sure . Mom , I can take care of you . 
 I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman . 
 I hope I can fly to any place like superman . So I can touch the sky . 

Mom , I've got something to tell you . 
 Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs . 
 It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine . 
 Nothing of that sort ! 
 Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus . 
 Let me see.Yes . I will buy a plane for you . There is no traffic up there . 
 Yes . 
 Sure , come on in . 
 My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? 
 What is a back-packer ? 
 Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . 
 So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . 
 I'll try my best . 
 Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . 
 I surely am . But still there is one single problem . 
 I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . 
 I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? 
 Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? 
 I can so that . 
 How did it go ? 

Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . 
 Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . 
 It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? 
 That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . 
 Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . 
 Please change your clothes first ! 
 Sorry , but no jeans here . 

Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! 
 Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . 
 So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . 
 This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? 
 Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? 
 Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . 
 He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . 
 Who knows ! 
 Come on , just a little piece . 
 I have no idea . 
 That's amazing . 
 Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . 
 OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . 
 May , just let him go . 
 I know . 
 He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . 
 He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . 
 Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . 
 I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . 

Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ? 
 May , I really regret watching it with you last night . 
 Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring . 
 Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary . 
 That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies ! 
 Don't call me kid . I am a grownup . 
 Of course ! I can watch them without you ! 

Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? 
 Why are so many extra gifts left here ? 
 How about giving them to that old man ? 
 By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? 
 I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . 
 That's true . 
 Okay . How tiring the job is ! 
 Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . 
 Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . 
 Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . 
 No , but tell me some . I am interested . 
 Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ? 
 But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . 
 Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? 

I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . 
 Thank you for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will over come them one by one . 
 How did he make a fortune ? 

I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 

Whatever we do , we should do it above board . 
 Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . 
 Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
 Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . 
 He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . 

Do you think you'll get the project ? 
 I see.After all , he's boss's son . 

What's his job ? 
 But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . 

He has a girlfriend already . 
 Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . 

John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . 
 What is your idea ? 

Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . 
 He is too scared to ask her . 

I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . 
 I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 

Doesn't she have any friends ? 
 Such friends are even worse than enemies . 

Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . 
 He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . 

Have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ? 
 I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . 

Does your wife work ? 
 Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? 
 You are really a hen-pecked husband . 
 Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . 
 Then you will be in line for a doom . 
 I'm very sorry I can't . 
 I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . 
 Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? 
 I think I'm getting a heart stroke . 
 Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . 
 Beauty costs , honey . 
 Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . 
 Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . 

What's so special today ? 
 Didn't you notice all the roses ? 
 Oh , God . I just forget it . 
 No . But now he will be in bigger trouble ! What's a boyfriend for ? Forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 Oh , it's Clive . 
 Excuse me for a while.Clive asked me out to a movie ! Do you want to join us ? 
 So what ? 

Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . 
 Yes , definitely . 
 Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . 
 This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . 
 Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . 
 Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . 
 It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! 
 He is everybody's type . 
 Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! 
 Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . 
 That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! 
 You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . 
 You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . 

Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . 
 Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . 
 I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . 
 Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . 
 Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . 
 A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . 
 Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! 

What are you reading ? 
 Aha , Fitness Consultant . Very good , Don't you know about the rules in this office ? 
 Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ? 
 What kind of sports ? 
 Interesting . What were you reading just now ? 
 Really ? That sounds interesting ! 
 No . It's confiscated for now . And I will return it to you after I finish reading it . 
 The same question to you . 
 Deal , Where is Gucci ? 
 Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . 
 Get real . Don't be so pathetic . 
 Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . 
 Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . 
 She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . 

Come on , you are left behind ! 
 You just need more exercise . 
 I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . 
 Why ? 
 But I want to burn up more calories ! 
 Really ? I will slow down then . 
 Oh , my god , are you OK ? 
 Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . 
 I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . 
 Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . 
 I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? 
 Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . 
 I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . 
 I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . 
 Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . 
 Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . 
 Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? 
 Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . 
 Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . 
 I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . 
 Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . 
 What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? 
 That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . 
 That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . 
 I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . 
 Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? 
 Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? 
 Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? 

Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . 
 OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . 
 Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . 
 Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . 
 Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . 
 Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . 
 Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? 

Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? 
 The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . 
 Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . 
 Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . 
 In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . 
 Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . 
 Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . 
 Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? 

Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? 
 Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? 
 Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? 
 Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? 
 Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? 
 You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . 
 That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? 
 Exactly , now , tell me the time . 

Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . 
 Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . 
 As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . 
 Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? 
 Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? 

Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . 
 I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? 
 My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . 
 Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? 
 Really ? 
 He performs very well . He is so funny ! 
 OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? 
 OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! 

Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . 
 Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . 
 Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . 
 Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . 
 By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . 

Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . 
 And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . 
 There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . 
 Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . 
 OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . 

I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . 
 If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane . 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . 
 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . 
 Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . 
 Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . 

Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 
 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 
 I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? 
 Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . 
 You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . 
 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
 News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . 
 Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . 
 Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
 Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . 
 Yes , 50 Yuan per month . 
 This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it . 
 No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars . 
 No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . 
 What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? 

Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? 
 Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? 
 Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? 
 Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . 
 Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? 
 Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . 
 Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . 
 Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . 
 This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . 
 Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . 
 Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . 
 Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances . 
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 
 They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 
 It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life . 
 Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter . 
 Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . 
 That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . 
 I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . 
 Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . 
 I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . 
 Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . 
 Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools . 
 Don't you know that ? It's panda . 
 OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ? 
 That's right . 
 You sound quite knowledgeable . 
 Actually , it likes milk too . 
 Do you know other famous animals in the world ? 
 That's right . OK , let's move on . 
 Is that different from this kind of zoo ? 
 So tell me about it ! 
 Special rules ? 
 Details ? 
 Why not ? 
 That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? 
 I prefer to go there next time . 

I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it . 
 Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? 
 Well , What kind of movies do you like ? 
 In a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies . 
 Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much . 
 So we can relax now . 

How time flies ! 
 I can still remember our first date . 
 Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . 
 You were dull at that time . 
 I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married . 
 Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic . 
 I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . 
 That's my favorite . 
 It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . 
 All in all , it will never lose its appeal . 
 Sure . Now you are talking . 
 Sure . What's playing ? 
 Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . 
 She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting . 
 Who is the director ? 
 Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 . 
 It tells a romantic and humorous love story . 

The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . 
 And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 

Do you believe in UFOs ? 
 But I never saw them . 
 You mean that you can them . 
 They come to the earth ? 
 Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? 
 That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? 
 Wow . Sounds fantastic ! 
 The days are getting longer ! 
 Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot . 
 That's great ! 
 And this kind of weather is rare for the season either . 
 So we must seize this chance to go the beach . 
 He will enjoy himself this weekend . 
 He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . 
 We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth . 
 I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . 

It seldom rains this summer . 
 Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . 
 It is serious . 
 I suspect it's unavoidable . 
 Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . 
 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 

They got a divorce at last . 
 You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . 

What will happen to the children if you break up ? 
 Why don't you make up with John . 

It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . 
 I am not certain about that . 

Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 
 Really ? 

You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 
 But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . 

May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . 
 Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread . 

Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . 
 What ? Beg your pardon . 
 I just cann't believe my ears ! 
 Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . 
 He deserved it . 
 Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . 
 You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . 
 Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 

What did her boss say to you ? 
 Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 

You look pale recently . 
 Take good care of yourself . 

You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 

You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
 Where did you spend your holiday ? 

To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! 
 Galileo is one of them . 

You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? 
 If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . 

The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
 It is incredible . 

Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 
 I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . 
 I guess so . 
 He spoke evil behind his back . 
 Someone told Joe off . 
 Sure . He ’ ll get the bag , I think . 
 Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 
 I'll bet you were a little embarrassed . 
 Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two . 
 I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . 
 Don't worry . We won't be the first . 
 Huh ? 
 It is ? Oh , that's nice . 
 Actually , I'd forgotten about it . 
 Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . 
 It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . 
 Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . 
 Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . 
 Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . 

Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . 
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 
 I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . 
 How much do you make ? 

Which church do you attend ? 
 What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? 
 Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? 
 Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? 
 Why do you really go to church ? 

Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? 
 But he seems to be very happy with Rose . 

I wonder if I can ask you a question . 
 Well ... er ... it is just ... just that I ... 
 I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks . 
 Yeah . But I ... 
 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . 
 She is expecting . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes ? 

Which school is your children in ? 
 Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . 
 But the private school amount to better schools . 
 That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . 
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . 
 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? 
 Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place . 
 What's the cause ? 
 I see why it lags behind other towns . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Yeah . He has no one to count on . 
 Yeah . You said it . 
 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
 I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
 That ’ s why many people look up to him . 
 I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend . 
 But I cannot forget him . 
 He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . 
 He ran four miles and came back dead beat . 

What did he say ? 
 It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . 

It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . 
 The government is making efforts to change situation . 

You married Joe , didn't you ? 
 I remember you are in love . 
 It's Greek to me . 
 Don't you know that he has been carrying a torch for Mary for years ? 
 Of course not . 

I'm exhausted . My new exercise class is so hard , 
 You thing so ? 
 Tomorrow morning . Try it . 
 Are you going to this class this morning ? 
 You're no able to move after this class . 
 You want to bet ? 
 I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
 No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . 
 I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . 
 I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . 
 I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . 
 Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 

An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Thomas Bradley . 
 Sorry , what was your last name again ? 
 Ok , I'm Tom . 
 And what do you do , Ted ? 
 Salesman ? 
 I work for American Airlines . 
 I'm in the Personnel Department . 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 It wasn't always like this , you know . 
 Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . 
 Certainly , perhaps . 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 

Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . 
 Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . 
 What time is your appointment ? 
 What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? 
 It must be about 6 o'clock . 
 You won't be late . It's still early . 
 No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . 
 You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . 
 Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . 
 It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . 
 I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . 
 Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . 
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . 
 What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . 
 Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 
 All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? 
 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 
 And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . 
 How ’ s your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? 

There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . 
 I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . 
 I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . 
 I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . 

What ’ s your working day like ? 
 Do you get paid onetime ? 
 Do you have any breaks ? 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . 

I ’ d love to have my own farm . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
 That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . 
 My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . 

What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? 
 I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . 
 Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 
 In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
 No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? 
 Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . 

What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 
 What else do you suggest ? 

What ’ s your city like ? 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 

Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . 
 I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . 
 I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . 
 You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . 
 Now there we are in agreement ! 
 Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . 
 I thought you were good at the high jump ! 
 Did you ever win any competitions ? 
 I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? 

Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . 
 Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? 
 That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . 
 That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? 
 Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . 
 Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . 
 I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . 
 Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . 
 Can you ride a horse ? 
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 

What are you doing ? 
 There are no countries marked on the map . 
 The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . 
 Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . 
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
 My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . 
 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . 
 The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . 
 There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . 

What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? 
 Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . 
 We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . 
 I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . 
 That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . 
 Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . 

I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . 
 Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . 
 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . 
 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . 
 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . 

Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 
 When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . 
 Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 
 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 
 That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . 
 I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . 
 Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . 
 There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . 

which countries have you been to ? 
 I thought you had been to Australia too . 
 I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 
 well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . 

Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? 
 Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . 
 We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? 
 That sounds very general . 
 One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? 
 We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? 
 Hi , Alex ! 
 I just got back from London . 
 It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . 
 It was 10 hours . 
 Yes , in Paris , France . 
 Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! 
 It was nothing . 
 Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . 
 That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . 
 If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . 
 Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . 
 Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . 

Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . 
 I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . 
 It must have really hurt afterwards . 
 I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . 
 Is there any pain now ? 
 Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? 

How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? 
 I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . 
 How would you do that ? 
 I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . 
 The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . 

Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? 
 Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . 
 Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks . 
 The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? 
 His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . 
 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . 
 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 

What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? 
 Who ’ s your favourite player ? 
 Do they have a good team ? 
 I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . 
 You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? 
 How many more games are there this season ? 

Hello ! How are you . 
 What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? 
 Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . 
 Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . 
 OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . 
 Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . 
 Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? 
 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? 
 It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . 
 Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . 
 Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . 
 I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . 
 Of course ! I bought two copies . 

I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 
 No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . 
 I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . 
 Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 
 There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . 
 Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . 
 How do I do that ? 
 That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . 
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . 
 I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines . 
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 
 You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography . 

Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 
 Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
 So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
 I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! 

Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? 
 How often do you run your anti-virus program ? 
 Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? 
 That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 
 What do you use your computer for ? 
 Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some program and learn how to use them . 
 I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? 
 So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . 
 How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? 
 How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? 

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 

It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . 
 I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . 
 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . 
 People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . 
 I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . 
 Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . 

Do you believe in god ? 
 I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . 
 For example ? 
 Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 
 Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . 
 Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? 
 First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . 
 It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . 
 Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . 
 No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . 
 So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? 
 That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . 
 How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . 

Do you think children watch too much Tv ? 
 Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . 
 They could go out and play with their friends . 
 Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . 

Hi ! What are you watching ? 
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? 
 Why do they go there ? 
 When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . 
 I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . 
 Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . 
 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? 

What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? 
 Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . 
 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 
 Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . 
 Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . 
 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 
 I bet you find the character difficult to write ! 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 
 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
 Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 
 It ’ s about Bob Dylan . 
 He ’ s a famous American musician . 
 It was written by Howard Sounds . 
 It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . 
 Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . 
 There are 15 chapters in total . 
 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . 
 No problem . Bob . 
 What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . 
 I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . 
 He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . 
 Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . 

What are you reading ? 
 It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . 
 Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 
 Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . 
 In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . 
 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 
 I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . 
 I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . 
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 

How many people are in your family ? 
 I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? 
 My parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 
 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . 
 About seven years now . and you ? 
 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 
 If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! 
 Of course not ! 
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 
 I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 
 Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 

I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? 
 I want to have a foot massage and haircut . 
 Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures . 
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? 
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 
 That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet . 

Are you interested in history ? 
 I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . 
 Some people say that history repeats itself . 
 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . 

Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? 
 How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? 
 Do they have any grandchildren ? 
 Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws ? 
 Do they have a large family ? 

When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 
 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . 
 That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? 
 Did you ? How is he these days ? 
 I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? 
 Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . 
 No , not very much . He ’ s too ambitious and dishonest . 
 Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . 
 I think I ’ m polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well , yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I ’ m not as shy as I think . Anyway , you ’ re certainly not shy ! 
 So , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 

How old is Keith ? 
 He ’ s a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . 
 He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning going in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 

How do you think people get their personalities ? 
 Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? 
 So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . 
 You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . 
 Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . 
 Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? 
 So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . 
 1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m . 
 Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . 
 He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . 
 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . 
 Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? 
 Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . 

What do you do for a living ? 
 Really ? Do you like it ? 
 I ’ m a bus driver . 
 No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . 
 She works as a teller in a bank . 
 Yes . She goes three times a week . 
 She wants to be a manager . 
 She takes classes in accounting and business . 
 Uh , yes . 
 Yes . I commute five days a week by train . 
 It ’ s really very good . 
 Well , trains are frequent and come on time . 
 I usually take the 5 thirty home . 
 No , I usually have to stand . 
 Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . 
 Morning , Jenny . Haven't seen you for ages ! 
 You did give me a surprise . How have you been ? 
 Not so well . I've come down with the flu . 
 It's really great to see you again . How about a drink tonight ? 
 How about seven ? 
 I'll pick you up . 

How are you ? 
 I haven ’ t seen you for several days . 
 What ’ s he doing ? 
 He must be happy . 
 Fine too . 
 Thank you . Good evening , Mr.Dean . 
 I'm Helen Baker . 
 Glad to meet you , too . 
 I'm from New Zealand . 
 I'm a teacher . 

Good morning , Mr.Jones ! 
 Nice to see you again . 
 How is everything ? 
 Quite well , thank you . 
 No , I was driven by my husband . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . 
 Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . 
 There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . 
 There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . 

Hi ! How are you going ? 
 Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Did you enjoy yourself ? 
 Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . 
 Goodbye . 
 Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . 
 I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? 
 I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . 
 Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone . Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time ? 
 I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something ! 

Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ? 
 Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . 
 I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! 
 Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . 
 Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . 
 There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . 
 The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? 
 Really ? That ’ s unusual . 
 Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . 
 As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . 
 The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . 
 In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . 
 That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? 
 Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . 

Hey , Ray , what are you doing right now ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do . 
 Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ? 
 Hmm ... I ’ Ve seen that , too . We could go for a walk in the park . 
 I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ? 
 Ok . I guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . What do you want to do ? 
 I would like to , but I injured my wrist last weekend . 
 That sounds interesting , but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking . 
 I don ’ t have a car . 
 No . do you have a car ? 
 Oh , good . Why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ? 
 Not yet . I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here . 
 Huh ? We are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ? 
 Hey ... as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ’ t really care what I do ! 
 Bye ! 
 No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . 
 Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! 
 I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . 
 You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . 
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . 
 Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? 
 ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . 

This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . 
 Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? 
 So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . 
 Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . 
 That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . 
 I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . 
 In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . 
 I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . 

Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 

How many languages can you speak ? 
 How well can you speak them ? 
 Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? 

You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . 
 I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . 
 Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . 
 Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 I suppose I do . 
 They use said it 
 It sure is 
 Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . 
 That's for sure . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 

Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 

What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? 
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
 How ’ s your son these days ? 
 He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . 
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . 
 It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
 No , what ? 
 You're kidding . 
 Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . 
 Well . Good for him . 
 No , have they have another fight ? 
 You must be joking . Those two ? 
 So when did all this happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 Positive 。 
 I'am absolutely sure I'm right . 
 This is right . There is no doubt in my mind . 
 Check and double check . 
 Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? 
 I believe industry is making us wealthier . 
 And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . 
 I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . 

I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . 
 It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . 
 But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money . 
 Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? 
 Why not ? 
 Is that very likely in England ? 

When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot . 
 Certainly . 
 Not always . But they like good meal . 
 How can I go there to have a taste ? 

Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help you in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 There ’ s a possibility . 
 I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . 
 Absolutely . Take my word for it . 
 Terrible . 
 I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . 
 I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . 
 Yeah , I guess I should . 
 Thank you very much . 

Lisa , I ’ Ve been thinking of something . 
 Well . I ’ Ve done a lot of business for my company . And now I feel like going into business for myself . 
 There ’ s a possibility . What do you say ? 

Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . 
 I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . 
 Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . 
 Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? 
 I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places 
 Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . 
 Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . 
 They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . 
 No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . 
 I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . 
 Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . 
 No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . 
 Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . 
 That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . 
 I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . 
 Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ? 

Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? 
 I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . 
 I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . 
 Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . 
 Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . 
 I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 

Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? 
 This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . 
 Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . 
 I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . 

What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? 
 Do you usually shower or take a bath ? 
 Do you shave every morning ? 
 Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ? 
 Your dentist must be proud of you ! 
 My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . 
 Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . 
 I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . 
 She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . 
 I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most . 
 What did you argue about ? 
 Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . 
 Did you lend him a lot of money ? 
 Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? 
 Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? 
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 
 Are you taking anything ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . 
 I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! 

Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 

Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . 
 It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . 
 Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? 

what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . 
 Oh , that's really tough . 
 I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? 
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 

You look upset , is there anything wrong ? 
 What is it ? 
 Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! 

I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . 
 It's sounds like fun . 
 I want to try something exciting . 
 I'll tell you all about it next Monday . 

Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . 
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 
 Not at all . 

You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? 
 You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? 
 On 20th May 1963 . 
 27th day of the fourth month . 
 It will begin at 5 thirty . 
 You can see it tomorrow . 
 See you . 

Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? 
 Really ? What was the matter ? 
 Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? 
 Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 
 how old is she ? 

This is my friend Jenny . 
 It's Snow . 
 They're blue . 
 It's brown . 
 She's 42 . 
 Who ? 
 Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? 
 Oh , she is . 
 Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . 

Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight . 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 

Hi Jane , you look great . 
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . 
 No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . 

Peter , how often do you exercise ? 
 Now , tell me , what do you eat ? 
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 What do you drink ? 

I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 I think we would be able to make it . What time shall we come ? 
 Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? 

It's terrible how things have changed . You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
 No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . 
 Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . 
 Johnson ? I can't place them . 
 They've completely slipped my mind . 
 No , I don't recall a thing about them . 
 Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . 
 It's us . 
 Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ? 
 Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . 
 Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 What did he say ? 
 Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? 
 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? 

Hot in here , isn't it ? 
 Is it Ok if I sit here ? 
 Thanks . My name's Bill Peters , by the way . 
 Nice to meet you . And what do you do , Susan ? 
 Oh , are you ? And what are you studying ? 
 Really ? 
 I'm an engineer , I work for Boeing . Say , would you like a drink ? 

Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget . Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Oh , French dressing . 
 We still prefer French dressing . 
 Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
 Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it ! 
 No , I never do that . 
 I don't want to mark my table , of course . 
 I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't come back so early . 
 Oh , you've got a good memory . 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 It's Gone With the Wind . 
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 

Do you know much about computers ? 
 I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now . 
 Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . 
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 
 That's right . 
 But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . 
 They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . 

Um , which of them is the better typist ? 
 Is there any difference in their short hand ? 
 How about languages ? 
 Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . 
 Oh , what ’ s he like ? 
 Yes . 
 Um , that ’ s good . 

Would you like to come to our party ? 
 what happened ? You look so pale . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . 
 Don't loose heart . Everything will be fine . 

Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 

Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 

Is this your new teacher ? 
 Is she short ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 And how old is she ? 

Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ? 
 There ’ s a good movie called Summer in Beijing . 
 Let ’ s find out what time it starts . 
 Here it is . It starts at 8 o'clock . 

Would you like any toast , dear ? 
 Toast , dear ? 
 Would you like any tea , dear ? 
 Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . 

Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't have much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 

I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 

Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . 
 OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . 
 A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . 
 Oh where was that ? 
 Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
 She will be 86 next month . 

I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand . 
 Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . 
 Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? 
 You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . 
 And also to frighten away evil spirits . 
 And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 

Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . 
 So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . 

Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 
 That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? 
 I'll get my things and meet you there . 

Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good . Let's go now . 

Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian . 
 Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? 
 Around seven . 
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 
 Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . 

Good morning Mike ! 
 I am having an exam at 9 o'clock , It's already 8 thirty . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can fill in . 
 Yes , It's only 8 forty . Thanks so much ! 
 Have a nice day , bye ! 
 I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . 
 Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . 
 There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan . 
 Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option . 
 That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... 
 You mean Armistice Day . 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . 
 Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations ! 
 Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 This is it ? 

So , how'd everyone do ? 
 Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it . 
 It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood ! 

Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . 
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 
 Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! 
 Is that why you missed work today ? 
 Www ! 
 Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . 

Hello , ladies . I'm firing up the grill . We can eat in an hour or so . 
 Yi-jun , we're in the States . Here it's all burgers , steaks , and dogs . 
 You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ... 

How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . 
 Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! 
 I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . 

What do you think of this one ? 
 And this one ? Too flashy ? 
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 
 Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . 
 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
 Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! 
 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
 No , please feel free . 
 Do you work in Shanghai ? 
 No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . 
 Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! 

Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 
 That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! 
 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 

Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . 
 Admit it . You just think of Mussolini . 
 Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . 
 Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . 
 So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . 
 Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . 

Thank you so much . I can't take this . 
 What did she mean just now about raising pigs ? 
 Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . 

Holly , I just heard some terrible news . 
 What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . 
 Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? 

Is that true ? 
 Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! 
 She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy . 

Who's that ? 
 Is that your cousin in the back ? 
 What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? 
 And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . 
 No , not really . 
 Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . 

What are you two doing in here ? 
 I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . 
 All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? 

I just meant that she's got different taste . 
 She's pretty conservative . 
 Yes . 
 About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? 
 I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . 
 Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . 
 Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ? 
 Really ? What kind of prizes ? 
 A new car ! You're kidding ! 
 Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? 
 Gee , I don't think I own any red underwear , but I can buy some ! 
 Hi ! Nicole ! 
 Great . We can't keep up with the demand . 
 How about you ? 
 Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate . 
 Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . 
 I'll miss you too , my friends . 
 We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! 
 He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! 

Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it . 
 Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow ! 
 So find a guy to marry and you can get one ! 
 Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys . 
 I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . 
 Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! 
 Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? 
 Does that mean you're going to take my advice ? 
 I might be able to help ... 
 We'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ... 
 Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ... 
 No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . 
 How's that ? 

Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? 
 Really ? Wow with who ? 
 Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? 
 That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? 
 I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! 
 Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! 
 Not only that ! 
 OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! 

Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ? 
 They're beautiful . Taylor , you're so pale and skinny ! 
 I guess . Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? 

That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . 
 I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . 
 A match made in heaven . 
 He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . 
 When did you start worrying about your weight ? 
 No , Jess , chill out ! 
 What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? 
 Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! 

Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . 
 And after church they come here for lunch ? 
 Yeah , what's up with that ? 

I think I need a new notebook ... 
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 Believe it ! 

Hey , Lily ! You won't believe what happened in class today ! 
 A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class ! 
 Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ? 

Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! 
 It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me . 
 Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once ! 

And lots of " Dear Abby " sob stories ... 
 No wonder you're such a wacko ... 
 Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... 

You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 
 It's not breathing ! 
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . 
 And you'd look so cool ! 
 You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... 
 No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! 
 And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... 
 How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! 
 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . 
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ... 
 Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . 
 Teresa Jones got a boob job . 
 I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... 
 But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM . 
 What other features are listed ? 
 Totally cool colors ! 

And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant ! 
 OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ? 
 So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? 

... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! 
 Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! 
 Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . 

Where are we headed now ? 
 Awesome . Was someone killed there ? 
 Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? 

Are you sure it was him ? 
 You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? 
 Maybe he was just visiting someone . 

The weekend's finally here ! 
 Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . 
 We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . 

Taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! 
 Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . 
 We're just worried about you , Taylor . 

Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! 
 Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? 
 Some of my grappa will cure your shyness . 
 It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! 

Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . 
 Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . 
 Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce . 

Does anyone need a drink ? 
 It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! 
 No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? 

Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend ? 
 You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball . 
 True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now . 
 Hello ? Is the real Taylor in there ? 
 As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . 
 ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . 
 That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! 
 Why ? Are they good ? 
 I'm ready ! Whoa , what a hard throw ! I can't get that ! 
 Ummmph ! 
 You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . 
 You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . 
 Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . 
 I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . 
 They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! 

Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus . 
 Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . 
 I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . 

Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? 
 There's a garage sale around the corner . 
 What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? 

That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . 
 Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . 
 Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . 
 OK , but they better tag lightly ! 
 It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . 
 Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! 
 You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... 
 I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . 
 True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? 

Wanna chill out and watch cable ? 
 It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . 
 BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV . 

Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . 
 They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . 
 Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . 

Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! 
 Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures . 
 Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? 

I've never met anyone like Clyde before . 
 Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . 
 Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! 
 You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... 
 You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . 
 Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . 

Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . 
 Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . 
 My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . 
 Well , thanks for the suggestions . 

I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! 
 An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . 
 GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? 
 Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? 
 No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! 

Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? 
 Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ? 
 Well , I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week . 
 And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday , fingers crossed . 
 I will , Michelle . Speak to you soon . 
 I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . 
 Pick-up lines don ' t work ! 
 What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! 
 That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . 
 Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” 

You want to go to the movies tonight ? 
 The new Twilight movie ! 
 Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . 

I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . 
 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . 
 Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 
 Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . 
 Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . 
 You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . 
 Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . 
 We are such weirdos right ? 
 Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . 
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 

Hey Nick , what are you up to ? 
 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . 
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! 
 Let ’ s do it ! 
 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! 
 No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . 
 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 
 OK ! 
 Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! 
 Your future husband ! 

What are you doing ? 
 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 
 I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . 
 Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . 
 All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! 

Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! 
 That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians ! 
 Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . 
 Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
 Well , there is that , yes . 
 It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . 
 Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . 
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . 
 Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! 
 Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! 
 Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! 
 Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . 
 No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? 
 And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! 
 See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . 

Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 
 What was that ? 
 Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . 
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! 
 Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . 
 Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 
 ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... 
 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . 
 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 
 What happened ? 
 Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 Uh-huh . 

Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . 
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . 
 One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . 

Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! 
 Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! 
 That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . 
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 
 You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . 
 Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . 
 Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 

Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 
 Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . 
 That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! 

Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 
 You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! 
 Fine ! 
 Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! 
 Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! 
 You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . 
 Well , I don ’ t know . 
 Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 
 What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! 
 Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! 
 Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . 
 Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . 
 Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . 
 I hope you are right . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . 
 You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! 
 Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? 
 Are you trying to lose weight ? 
 You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . 
 Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . 
 Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . 
 Don ’ t count on it . 
 Why would that be funny ? 
 Why ? 
 I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . 
 Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . 
 Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! 

It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! 
 Do you have a New Year's resolution ? 
 Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . 
 Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! 

What are you doing , awake ? 
 But it's almost midnight ! 
 Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? 
 Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! 
 Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! 
 Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! 
 You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? 
 Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists . 
 All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks . 
 Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell . 
 Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations ! 
 That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! 
 I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . 

Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! 
 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . 
 Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! 
 They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! 

Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? 
 No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . 
 My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... 
 Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . 
 Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? 
 Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . 
 Yes , me too . 

So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? 
 Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! 
 Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . 
 Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . 
 Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! 

Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 
 Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . 
 Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . 
 OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! 
 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 

This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 For example ? 
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 
 Well , I have no regrets ! 

Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 
 Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . 

You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . 
 Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . 
 You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . 
 At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . 

I ’ m forming a music band . 
 Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . 
 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? 
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 

Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye 
 I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . 
 Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . 
 I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... 
 You are something else you know that ? 
 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 
 Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . 
 I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . 
 You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . 
 Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . 
 Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . 
 You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? 
 So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? 
 Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . 
 Laura ... 

Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? 
 Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! 
 Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . 
 Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! 
 Cinct de mayo ? 
 Do we get a day off from school then ? 
 Www , man ! 
 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
 And then what happened ? 

Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? 
 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 
 My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! 
 If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! 
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! 
 Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . 
 It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
 Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? 
 Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? 

Where to , miss ? 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 
 Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! 
 I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . 
 Uh ... yeah .. of course ! 

Can we talk ? 
 You know what I mean . 
 I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... 
 I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . 
 Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... 
 You do ? 
 Oh , I love you too ! 
 Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . 
 Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! How is going ? 
 Yeah ? How ’ s he doing ? 
 Oh yeah ? 
 Ha ha , really ? 

Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . 
 That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! 
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores 

Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time ! 
 Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! 
 Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . 
 Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . 
 Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
 Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! 
 See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . 
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 
 He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... 
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 
 Yeah ? 

So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . 
 Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat , no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . 
 But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! 
 Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? 
 Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . 
 The Bulls , of course ! 
 Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . 
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! 
 This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! 

Nick ! How ’ s it going ? 
 What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? 
 It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . 
 Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? 
 Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
 Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
 I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . 
 Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . 

I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! 
 Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! 
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! 
 That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? 

This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . 
 Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . 
 Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . 
 What sort of western food do you like best ? 
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . 
 It's still early . 
 Good morning , John ! 
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? 
 I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? 
 That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . 
 What's that ? 
 Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? 
 That's the most important thing . 
 Forget about it . 
 Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . 

Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . 
 There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . 
 What about sunday ? 
 Maybe next week . 
 Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . 

I heard that ben is forming his own band . 
 Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . 
 I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . 
 I love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice . 
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . 
 Yes . My car is having problems . 
 It won't start . 
 No , thank you . I think I can handle it . 
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . 
 I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . 
 OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . 
 Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . 
 No problem . Call me when you get back . 
 That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . 
 Great ! That's settled then . 

Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday ? 
 If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people . 
 Around six pm . 
 No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer . 
 Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer . 
 Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . 
 Is there something any need ? 
 Yes , I have nothing to do . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . 
 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 
 OK . Then I'll be expecting you . 

What kind of music do you like listening to ? 
 Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . 
 Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . 
 Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . 
 You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . 
 That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . 
 Sure , what do you need to do there ? 
 I have to exchange some money . 
 I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . 
 Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . 
 I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . 
 Yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . 
 Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . 
 Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? 
 I had some good financial news yesterday too . 
 No , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . 

Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? 
 People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . 
 There must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . 
 Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . 
 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . 
 Don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . 
 Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . 
 What do you do there ? 
 I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . 
 Yes , That's him over there-the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ? 

How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . 
 May I know your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? 
 I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft . How are things with you ? 
 May I know what you do ? 
 Sure . That would be great . Good luck . 

Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . 
 That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . 
 How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . 
 Well . I really do have to go . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 America ? Did you get admit to MIT ? 
 Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . 
 Really going to miss you . 
 Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey . 
 Look after yourself . Bye . 

I want to say goodbye to everyone . 
 I ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning . 
 You really don ’ t need to . 
 I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . 
 Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . 
 Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . 
 Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . 
 That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think . 
 It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? 
 Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? 
 That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . 
 Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . 
 So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . 
 How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . 

What ’ s the area of your country ? 
 That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? 
 What ’ s the average income ? 
 So your country is fairly rich . 
 Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . 
 Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . 
 It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . 
 Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . 
 Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . 
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . 
 Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? 
 How was it ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . 
 Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! 
 Give me your email , would you ? 

Is there a lot of crime in your city ? 
 It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . 
 Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . 
 That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . 
 I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . 
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 
 I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . 
 If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . 
 The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . 

There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? 
 We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . 
 In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . 
 Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . 

I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . 
 So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . 
 We really have some movable weather sometime . I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . 
 I guess you are right . Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . 

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . 
 What methods do you use to conserve water ? 
 I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
 Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . 
 We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . 
 I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ? 
 Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? 
 I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . 
 In the summer it gets very hot . The temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . When it is hot we often get rains . The winters are drier . 
 What are the temperatures in winter ? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . 
 Yeah , we do . In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . I heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? 
 Yes , they are like I said we have thunderstorms . But each one usually last a few hours . Then the skys are clear again . 
 My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . But my parents and I never see it outside of my city . 
 As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean . But people still go swimming all year around . I prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning . 
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 
 There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . 
 Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . 

That looks like an interesting book . 
 There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . 
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 
 Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . 
 What sports do they play there ? 
 Is that building a perfect cube ? 
 Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . 
 I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? 
 What do you do in winter ? 
 I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . 
 Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? 

How do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ Ve retired ? 
 What do you have for breakfast ? 
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 
 How do you spend your afternoons ? 

Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? 
 It seems that the climate in this country is changing . 
 I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . 
 Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . 
 There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . 
 Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . 
 The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . 
 Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . 
 Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . 
 So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . 
 There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? 
 We have some too . Do you have a lot of coal ? 
 There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small . 
 That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers . 
 It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests . 
 Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? 

Does your country export a lot of natural resources ? 
 Which resources do you have to import ? 
 I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . 
 If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . 

How long will it take us to drive to London ? 
 That ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . 
 So , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? 
 No . let me take a look ... It ’ s longer than my car . 
 Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . 

Which sports are popular in your country ? 
 Do many people like tennis ? 
 In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . 
 I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . 
 There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . 
 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . 
 He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . 
 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . 
 They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . 
 I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! 
 It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . 
 The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . 
 I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . 
 Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . 
 I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . 
 I will , do you want me to bring anything ? 

Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . 
 Can you make it on Tuesday ? 
 Anytime after six will be fine . 

Do you mind if I come over to use your computer ? 
 Does that mean I can't use it tonight ? 

Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? 
 You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . 
 Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . 
 Busy with your work again ? 
 I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! 
 Of course not . I'm afraid of them . 
 I'm afraid I'll feel sick at the sight of it . 
 Really ? 
 I will . Thanks for telling me . 
 Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ? 
 Be seeing you then ! 

Now , David , can I get you a drink ? What will you have ? 
 What about you , Mary ? 

Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? 
 Why ? 

What would you like to do tonight ? 
 What about going to a movie ? 

Mary , today is a great day for you . 
 Oh , here's a little token of my affection . 

Hello , Jack.It ' s good of you to come . 
 Thank you , Jack.To be frank , I'd rather forget my birthday . 

Where do you spend the weekend ? 
 That's nice . 
 That'd be great ! Thank you . 
 What're you going to buy ? 
 OK . 
 But Grandpa will be working . 
 I almost forget . 
 It depends on the weather . 
 That'll be great . 
 Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . 
 I think so , too . 
 You mean you want to stay at home ? 
 I thought maybe you were interested in an outing . 
 What for ? 
 Sorry , I don't feel like playing . I have too much homework . 
 What're the teams ? 
 I bet AC Milan will lose . 
 What should we take ? 
 Good idea ! 
 No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official . 
 What an idea ! 
 Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . 
 Of course not.He drowned . 
 No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? 
 Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . 
 Yes , such as Christmas and Easter . 
 Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . 
 On that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts . 
 They give chocolate in return . 
 Usually we have a month off . 
 I'll stay at home and have a complete rest . 
 Yes . 
 No problem . What should I bring ? 

Do you drink the Robust Milk every day ? 
 It will make you as fit as a fiddle . 

Another weekend is coming ! 
 Yes.What will you do this weekend ? 

I'm feeling wonderful . 
 I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool . 

Have the aerobic classes any effect on you ? 
 Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . 
 I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
 Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? 
 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 

You look pale today . 
 You should do sports to keep young . 

I'm going to see the doctor this weekend . 
 I think I need a thorough check-up . 

There's a concert in Capital Theatre this Sunday . 
 Look , I have two tickets.Will you go with me ? 

Hi , Francis . 
 Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . 
 Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . 
 Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . 
 Me too . Have a great day . 
 What for ? 
 Why , you look pretty all right . 
 You moved to a new place ? 
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? 
 Who else will come ? 
 Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ? 

I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? 
 To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . 
 Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? 

Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? 
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 
 I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
 Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . 
 I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ? 

Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? 
 My name is Paul.Is Mr.Smith in ? 

How nice of you to come ! 
 Just fine , thanks.And you ? 

Good evening , Mr.Brown . 
 It's nice of you to invite us . 
 Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ? 
 Fine.We ' ll be expecting you . 
 Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . 
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . 
 Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . 
 It is such a nice place . 

Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 
 Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . 
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 

How are you making out ? 
 I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift . 

Would you like some coffee , Tom ? 
 Here's some sugar . 

There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . 
 From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . 

Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? 
 Better luck this time ! 
 Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? 

Do you know about All Fools ' Day ? 
 April fool ! 

How about another beer ? 
 Stay around for a while.The party is warming up . 

I had a wonderful evening . 
 I will . 
 Please come in , Mr.Jackson . 

Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ? 
 Titanic . 
 Front , please . 
 Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows ? 
 All right.We ' ll take the second row.By the way , how much is it ? 
 Fairly expensive . 
 Can you stay a little longer ? 

It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . 
 OK . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Good night ! 
 Keep in touch ! 

Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . 
 Thank you , shall I open it now ? 
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . 
 Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . 
 I hope we'll get together again soon . 
 Thank you . 
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 
 Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . 

I'm going to have some people over for dinner Saturday night.Would you like to join us ? 
 Some other time then ? 

Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? 
 That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . 

Would you mind if I make a suggestion ? 
 Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health . 
 You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ? 
 This weekend would be OK with me . 
 Sorry to hear that . 
 Fine , we'll be expecting you then . 
 Yeah , it'll make a hit , I think.When will it be on , do you know ? 

It's hard to get tickets for the movie . 
 Yeah , two at the tenth rows . 
 3.5 dollars each . 
 Yes , Would you like to have the seats in the front or at the back ? 

Shall we go to a movie tonight ? 
 Gone with the Wind . 
 Sorry , I've no idea . 
 But I think it wasn't too bad . 
 It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone . 
 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . 
 I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . 
 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . 

Shakespeare was born in 1867 . 
 Are you sure ? Can you make it more exact ? 

I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? 
 How did that happen ? 
 Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . 
 But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so . 

I think we should accept his plan . 
 Why ? 

I think this one will do . 
 Why ? What's wrong with it ? 

They're very good friends , aren't they ? 
 Oh , it's unbelievable ! 
 You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid . 

Which season do you like best ? 
 I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . 
 Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . 
 I just had a quarrel with him . 
 No , thanks . 
 As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . 

How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ? 
 May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ? 

DO you have any plan for your future ? 
 Many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.It seems to be a trend . 

So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . 
 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 

Good Lord ! Look at that man . 
 He's swimming in the cold sea . He must be very strong . 

How have you been ? 
 And how's everyone in your family ? 
 I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't . 
 I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant . 
 I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste . 
 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . 

Hi , Monica , I got big news . 
 Not really , just take a wild guess . 
 Well , it is not going to happen so soon , I guess . 
 Ok , I lost 5 pounds . 
 Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus . 
 Yeah , it's a block away down the street . 
 Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . 
 You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . 

Have you ever played Making ? 
 Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . 
 It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . 
 I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . 

Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! 

Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . 
 Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . 
 Come on ! It is really a fun game . 
 You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard . 
 You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . 

Which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ? 
 I've got no kite . Do you have one ? 

Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? 
 Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? 
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . 

I wonder if you agree that money is not happiness . 
 Then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ? 

Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . 
 No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . 
 Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? 
 It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . 
 And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . 
 Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . 

Who's your favorite film star ? 
 What films feature him ? 

Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? 
 When did you form this hobby ? 

Have you started your report yet ? 
 It's easy . You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for . 

Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . 
 Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . 

Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . 
 So what ? 
 I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did . 
 When ? 
 And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise . 
 Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . 

I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 

Did you hear peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 

Excuse me . May I use the phone first ? 
 You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago . 

Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 

Do you watch a lot of TV ? 
 Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . 

Who is your favorite music composer ? 
 Then you must despise such modern music as rock ? 

Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? 
 Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . 

Are you sure you heard right ? 
 I don't believe you . 

Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . 
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . 

What kind of movies do you like , Sue ? 
 Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ? 
 Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . 
 This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . 

I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? 
 I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . 

Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? 
 Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags . 
 Wow , you're not kidding . Hold on a second . Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 
 No , I think Harry will get it . 
 OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . 
 I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . 
 It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . 
 Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! 
 Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . 
 No . Of course not . But what for ? 
 I see . But I'm busy now . How about tomorrow ? 
 No kidding ? 
 You can't beat that . 
 You can trust him . He always tells the truth . 
 I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . 
 I'm planing to go balling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? 
 Why not ? 

I love ice cream . 
 I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . 

What do you think of shopping ? 
 What do you think of big department store ? 

You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . 

Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? 
 He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town . 

Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? 
 No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . 
 What's the temperature today anyway ? 

Well , what brings you here ? 
 Does she live nearby ? 

Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? 
 Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? 
 Great , so what happens now ? 

How long have you been in Taiwan ? 
 So , where did you grow up ? 
 I am not sure , where exactly is it ? 
 No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . 
 No , I first came here 1995 . 
 Well , I am from Canada . Actually . 
 That ' ok . That's happens all the time . 
 Well , I like to play the piano . 
 About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . 
 Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 

Hi , Sandra . how was your weekend ? 
 Fantastic ! how was that ? 
 I might . what did you do yesterday ? 

So Janet , do you do any sports ? 
 Yeah , how often do you go ? 
 Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? 

The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . 
 If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . 

I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? 
 I went to France last summer . 

It seems a glorious day today . 
 It's beginning to spot . 

Show us our itineraries , please . 
 How long will the trip take ? 

They must be your parents , what do they do ? 
 Do they often take you out ? 

When do you go to bed usually ? 
 That's helpful for your health . 

Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? 
 What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? 
 And your parents took it badly ? 
 Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? 
 How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? 
 Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . 
 Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . 

What's the name of the series just showed ? 
 What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ? 

Do you like watching TV ? 
 What do you exactly mean by usually ? 

Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? 
 It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . 
 Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . 

What's your favorite TV Program ? 
 I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . 

I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 

Do you take a bus to and from work ? 
 Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . 
 That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . 
 You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! 
 Yeah , absolutely ! 
 You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? 

You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 
 Do you know Chinese better now ? 
 Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . 
 A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . 
 Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . 

Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . 
 Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . 
 Sure . 
 Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . 
 Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . 
 No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! 
 Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . 
 My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . 
 That would be great ! Thanks a lot ! 
 How about Great Canyon ? 
 Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . 
 He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . 
 It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? 
 Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . 
 I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . 
 I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . 
 Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! 
 You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . 
 Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . 
 You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . 

Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? 
 do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? 
 What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? 

Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ? 
 Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? 
 I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? 
 Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . 
 Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast . 
 Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now . 

Can I get you something to drink ? 
 I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? 
 About six years ... 
 I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . 
 That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! 
 Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . 
 Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . 
 Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? 
 So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? 

For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? 
 I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . 
 Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . 
 As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . 
 We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . 
 I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . 
 It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... 
 No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? 
 I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . 
 Now you're talking . 
 Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . 
 It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . 
 I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . 
 Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . 
 Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . 

Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... 
 Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . 
 Alright ... I get your point . 
 If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . 
 It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . 

Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . 
 Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? 
 Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . 
 Why doesn't he just drive to work ? 

So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . 
 Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! 
 What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? 
 Must be one smart guy . 
 Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . 
 Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . 
 They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . 
 Have you ever been to Japan ? 

How can I tell her about this ? 
 There is no need to be so frustrated . 
 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 I should finish it as soon as possible . 
 Why can I learn it ? 
 I feel I really stupid . 
 Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune . 

Is that girl your girlfriend ? 
 She doesn't look like our classmate . 
 Really , she's so pretty . 
 We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . 
 Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . 
 Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . 
 They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . 
 What can you expect ? Not that good . 
 Just let it go . 
 Not bad , just let it go . 
 Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . 
 It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! 
 I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? 

Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . 
 I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . 
 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 I think you ’ re right ! 
 And what ’ s the problem ? 
 And you want to know what to wear ? 
 That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? 
 My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 
 I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . 
 You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . 
 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
 It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . 
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . 
 She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . 
 Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . 
 I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 

Come in , come in ! 
 I thought we were supposed to meet here . 
 I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . 
 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . 

Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . 
 Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . 
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 
 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 

So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 
 Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . 
 Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . 
 And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . 

Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . 
 No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one 
 Thanks for telling me this . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . 

Merry Christmas ! 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 

Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . 
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 
 I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . 
 How much do you make ? 

Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? 
 No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? 
 You must have a wonderful time . 
 No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . 
 What ? 
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Huh ? I can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud . 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 
 I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . 
 That ’ s good . It ’ s good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . 

Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . 
 Gambling ? Where ? 
 If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . 
 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . 
 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
 Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . 
 No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . 
 Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . 
 Actually it will be my first time to meet her . 
 That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . 
 The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . 

Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! 
 Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . 
 In the van . 
 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? 
 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! 
 As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . 
 You have such good ideas ! 
 I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . 
 Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . 
 I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted . 

I can ’ t wait to retire . 
 And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! 
 What do you plan on doing after you retire ? 
 I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . 
 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 
 Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . 
 Palmistry ? What is that ? 
 Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . 
 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . 
 What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? 
 What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? 
 Hey ! 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 
 So what did you do ? 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 

What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . 
 You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 
 What'd he do ? 
 Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? 
 Good . I totally agree with what you did . 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 
 Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! 
 Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 
 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 

Hey , what's new ? 
 Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . 
 Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . 
 But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . 
 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! 
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 That's better . 
 Believe what ? 
 You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . 
 To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . 
 No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . 
 When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . 
 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . 
 It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... 
 Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . 
 Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . 
 I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
 It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . 
 Sometimes they are too independent . 
 And what did the program say ? 
 I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . 
 And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . 
 Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? 
 You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? 
 Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . 
 I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . 
 I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . 
 Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . 
 Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . 
 It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . 
 Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? 
 Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? 
 Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . 
 Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . 
 Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . 
 I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . 
 Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . 

Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? 
 Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . 

Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . 
 They spend hours there , especially on weekends . 
 I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 
 No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . 
 Sure . I love going to the mall . 

Do you hear what happened to Sally ? 
 She had to go to the hospital . 
 She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . 
 Yeah , but that's what she did . 
 Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . 

Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! 
 Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . 
 Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . 
 It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere ! 
 Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . 
 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 At least you know what American women generally like in a man . 
 American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . 
 You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . 

Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . 
 I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . 
 Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . 
 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
 In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . 
 No , not at all . Glad to have you . 
 Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . 
 That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . 
 Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . 
 Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . 
 Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! 
 A house warming party ? 
 Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . 
 I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . 
 I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? 
 If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . 
 I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . 
 I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . 
 Hi , Don . What a surprise ! 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 
 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . 
 Sure . Join my class next week . 
 Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? 
 I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . 
 Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . 
 To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . 
 A lot of people feel the same way . 
 How about the languages . 
 That's more convenient . 
 Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . 
 Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight . 
 I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . 
 It's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway . 
 I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou . 
 By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ? 
 Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel . 
 I prefer boxing to beef . 
 Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . 
 It was very good . I followed it right to the end . 
 I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . 
 OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . 
 I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert . 
 Love Music Woman 
 Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . 
 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
 Stolen ? No , why ? 
 Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless . 
 If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened . 
 Didn ’ t anyone stop them ? 
 Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all . 

Do you have any idea for this vacation ? 
 Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs . 

Have you ever thought of going to Africa ? 
 Would you like to go with me ? 

Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? 
 Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . 

Hey , what's the matter ? 
 Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 

What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ? 
 There was a concert country music last week . 
 I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music . 

I don't think I'm getting better . 
 I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . 
 Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? 
 Fine . 
 150 pounds . 
 I can't bear eating less . 
 Yes . 
 Well , that happens . I hope she is all right . 
 That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . 

It will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends.What kind of movie do you like best ? 
 Shall we go downtown for a movie this Friday evening ? 
 I'm not sure . Let me give a call to find out . 
 Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . 
 He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall.You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . 
 Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 
 Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend . 
 Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 
 Six thirty , tonight . 
 All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye ! 

Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? 
 Japanese teams always play a dark horse . 

What are the most popular sports in your country ? 
 Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ? 
 Is it easy to learn ? 
 Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl . 

Can you tell the result ? 
 Now the score is in our favor . 
 Hard to say.Now the score is in our favor . 
 They're still fighting hard.Let ' s wait and see . 
 The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . 
 It doesn't seem to be so easy . 
 I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things . 

Well , it ’ s really too late . I have to go now . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t.My mother doesn ’ t want me to be late . I really have to go . 
 Thank you for your delicious meal . 
 Pity I haven't . If I can afford it , I'll certainly take a trip abroad . 
 How about going to italy next summer vacation ? 

Anything interesting in this city ? 
 It's worth the time . 

What kind of job have you ever had ? 
 How did you like your job ? 

I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it . 
 Not yet , what's your opinion ? 

Are you getting overtime ? 
 Have you thought about another job ? 

I've booked an air ticket to Venice . 
 I'd like to stay there for a week . 
 Certainly . 
 He's a hero in our town . 
 Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . 
 Oh , no . I don't think I'm in that good form . 
 To where exactly ? 
 That's still too far for me . 
 He was 20 years old then . 
 He's over sixty . 
 That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling . 
 Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . 
 Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . 
 He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . 
 Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . 
 Yes , my sister loves his personality . 
 Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . 
 Me , too . 
 You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green . 
 Marvelous idea ? 
 Are you going to take your children along ? 
 Have a nice holiday ! 
 I learned to drive and I got a driving license . 
 Travel . 
 Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world . 

Where do you plan to go this winter ? 
 Oh , yes , you like skiing . 

Bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ? 
 So let's get registered tomorrow . 

This man is your fiance , Dolly ? 
 He's handsome . 
 He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . 
 Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . 
 How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . 
 But there're some mare's tails . 
 Oh , really , I thought it was a sign of rain . 
 My mother works in a company as an accountant . 
 Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . 
 She's my grandma . 
 92 . 
 Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . 
 I hope so . 
 It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . 
 All right.Let ' s go . 
 He looks strong.What does he do ? 
 He must be very brave . 

Which team has won ? 
 But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 

I think he deserved his gold . 
 Yes , it's perfect ! 

Look ! It's clearing up . 
 I like summer as long as it's bright like this . 

Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman . 
 No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice . 

Is your father in the habit of having naps ? 
 Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? 

I want to go to china for sight-seeing.What do you think of it , Mum ? 
 Will you go with me , too ? 

Charles , have you finished your homework ? 
 I want you to have a walk with me . 

What do you know about Julia Roberts ? 
 I mean her personality . 

Whose part do you think is best played ? 
 You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 

How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? 
 You don't like the performance , do you ? 

Did you enjoy the movie ? 
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . 

A new film is on.Have you ever seen it ? 
 It's a feature film . 

I've had enough of that ! 
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . 

The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . 
 Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect . 
 How do you pay for it ? 
 Tell me if you need help . 
 No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? 
 Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . 
 I'm going to graduate this summer . 
 I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
 Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . 

Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
 Totally agree . What is your solution ? 
 You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . 
 But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . 

Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? 
 Did they mutiny ? 
 It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . 

Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 

I heard through the grapevine that Michael probably become the new sales manager . 
 I am not a rumor monger . 

I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 

Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . 
 Let's go to the new club on West Street . 
 You can wear that pretty red dress . 
 I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . 
 Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . 
 It was a nightmare . 
 Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . 
 Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . 
 I am still waiting for their call . 

The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? 

Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . 
 We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! 
 The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . 
 Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . 

Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? 
 How long is the holiday ? 
 Do you eat any special food for the festival ? 
 That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? 
 Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . 

I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . 
 Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet . 
 Don't be such a chicken ! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie . 
 I think there ’ s a Western on . 
 Well , I really wanted to see the football game . 
 I believe there ’ s a sitcom . 
 Let me look in the TV Guide first . 
 If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show . 
 Let's watch it together . 
 I hope I get an easy question like you did . 
 Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . 
 Oh , please ! I have no idea . 

Great ! I landed on Classic Movies . 
 I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind . 
 Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money . 
 Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings ! 
 Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? 

I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? 
 I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! 
 In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . 

I can't believe it ! I lost . 
 That's not fair , you got all the easy questions . 
 I want a rematch . Let's play again . 

OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? 
 Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! 

All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . 
 Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! 
 Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ... 

What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ? 
 The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... 
 You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? 
 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . 
 I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . 
 You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . 
 I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . 
 Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . 
 Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . 

I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! 
 That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? 
 Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? 

Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ? 
 Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ? 
 I'll go by myself then . 
 Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie . 
 I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . 
 No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured ! 
 Really well , thanks . 
 She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . 
 She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . 
 They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . 
 Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . 
 Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . 
 Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . 
 I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . 
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 
 I'm in between jobs at the moment . 
 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . 
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 
 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . 
 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . 
 yes , but not fluently . 
 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . 
 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . 
 thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! 
 Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ? 
 OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ? 
 Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . 
 Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . 
 If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . 
 Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . 
 My boss . 
 She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . 
 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . 
 She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . 
 She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . 
 That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . 
 I will do . 
 Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . 
 Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! 
 Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! 
 I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 
 Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! 
 I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? 
 Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? 
 Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . 
 I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . 
 Thanks . Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table . 
 Rita . Nice to meet you . 
 Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! 
 Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . 
 Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 . 
 I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! 

Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea . 
 I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs . 
 No . I recorded these from your Cds . 
 I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy ... 
 Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? 
 It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? 

Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . 
 Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . 
 If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . 

I think you're being a little naive . 
 That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned . 
 $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ... 
 Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? 
 Now we're getting to the truth . 
 See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . 
 Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? 
 So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? 
 Let me see it ! It's so small ! 
 How high did the price go ? 
 You didn't watch the end of the auction ? 

What does this have to do with me ? 
 Order tea . Isn't that what you like to drink ? 
 If you want to be macho , order a double shot of espresso . 

I'm more worried about snipers . 
 Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . 
 I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . 

I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? 
 They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . 
 Why not ? 

Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! 
 Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . 
 It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . 

Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back . 
 If they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . 
 Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? 
 I knew you'd come around ... 
 Whoops . That's my pager . I had to get it for work . 
 Well , I know how to turn it off ! 

You're so witty ... 
 This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . 
 It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . 
 Bingo ! 
 Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! 
 OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! 

What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? 
 You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? 
 What's that supposed to mean ? 

Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . 
 What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! 
 Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . 

Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . 
 He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! 
 Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . 

Are you ready for the big competition today , Todd ? The winner gets two tickets to the Sydney Olympics ! 
 We ’ Ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running . 
 You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . 
 I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! 
 I know . I've even worked up a sweat . 

What's the matter with you , Paul ? 
 Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 

Do you have cold medicine ? 
 No , I don't . 
 I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? 
 I will take the Aspirin then . And have you a small first-aid kit ? 
 I'll take it too . 

You look pale , Paul.What ' s wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that.Anything I can do for you ? 

I can't even imagine you snorkeling ! 
 OK , Bond . 
 So you can always keep two times at once ? 
 The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late . 
 I had to look after my son at home . 
 He has a fever . 
 I think so.Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm now working in a company . 
 Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . 
 20/350 . 
 Oh , yes , it is . 
 You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... 
 Let's just say I'll have it easy ... 
 Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards . 
 Does it have questions about foreign language films ? There's hardly any American films worth watching . 

Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame . 
 You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ... 
 I know they're out there . I'll find them . 

Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ? 
 You were born in the year of the monkey ? 
 Not at all ! That explains everything ! 
 All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ... 
 Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ? 
 Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ? 
 Same difference . What's this ? 
 Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ? 
 Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... 
 Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? 

You look very professional in the suit . 
 I appreciate it . It is related to company image . 
 Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . 
 To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . 

Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? 
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 
 I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
 Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . 
 Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! 
 Yes , please do . 
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . 

Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 
 Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . 
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 
 For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 
 That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? 
 It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . 
 Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . 
 No , really ? 
 Who will be there ? 
 That is good . He can leave you alone this time . 
 That ’ s open secret . 
 How did you know that ? 

Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . 
 No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . 
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 
 Make yourself at home . 
 Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . 
 You moved to a new place ? 
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? 
 Who else will come ? 
 Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ? 

Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck . 
 Oh , is that so ? 

I am thinking about resigning from my current job . 
 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . 
 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . 
 Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . 
 Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . 
 That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . 
 That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . 

I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 

I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . 
 I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . 

Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . 
 Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . 
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . 

Is the view going to be ok ? 
 I ’ ll do my best . 

Did you sign up for the picnic party ? 
 This time you can bring your daughter with you . 
 There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . 
 I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . 
 Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . 
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 
 Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . 

Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? 
 What about the environmental factors ? 
 Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . 
 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 How about As long as You Love Me ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! 

Let ’ s call it a day . 
 It ’ s hard to commute a long way . 

How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? 
 In what ? 
 Can you do the vault ? 

Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 
 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 

Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! 
 You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! 
 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! 
 Well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . 
 Since 1996 it has been . And I bet I'd be pretty good at it . I ride my mountain bike to work almost every day . 
 You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . 
 It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . 
 It's okay . 
 Don't be silly . 
 Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors . 
 Definitely . I really like Italian food . 
 Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . 
 It's fashionable . 
 Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . 
 Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . 
 It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' 
 Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . 

Who is it ? 
 You're always so careless . 
 Okay , but I haven't prepare supper . 
 What do you want to eat ? 
 Dumplings . 
 But whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls ! 
 To be honest , I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch ! 

You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? 
 I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . 
 Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . 

Are you ready , honey ? 
 Just dress formal . 
 It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . 
 You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . 
 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 
 How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? 

I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? 
 How did that happen ? 
 Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . 
 Sorry , I have to work overtime . 
 My boss promised to pay me double time . 
 Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . 
 Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . 

So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . 
 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 

You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 
 That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . 
 But if the company asks , what else can we do ? 
 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 
 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . 
 Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . 
 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . 

Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . 
 Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . 
 Come on ! It is really a fun game . 
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 
 Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . 
 Ok , then we can sign up for it together . 
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . 
 Certainly , work always comes first . 
 Well , keep a low profile . 
 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have trying my best to be a good employee . 
 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
 How regular ? 
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . 
 That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 
 Cool ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 

And lots of Dear Abby sob stories ... 
 No wonder you're such a wacko ... 
 Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... 

Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 What research ? 
 But they're just ads . 

How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? 
 You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? 
 Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? 
 How's your current job going ? 

Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . 
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . 
 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
 You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
 It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 
 That's a notebook ? 
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 
 That means they have tapered legs . 
 Mine are , too . 
 Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! 
 Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . 
 So decode this for me , Madame Psycho . 
 I'm waiting ... 

You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What is your current occupation ? 

Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? 
 Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . 

Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . 
 The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? 
 Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? 
 Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . 

Check out these wheels ! 
 No , I borrowed it . 
 You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me . 

I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . 
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? 

That way they look longer . 
 Putting on mascara . 
 I won't . 

I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . 
 Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . 
 With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . 
 Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . 
 Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . 
 Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . 
 Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . 
 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 
 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 
 Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . 
 Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . 

Any plans tonight ? 
 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 Just did my best . 
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 

I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . 
 He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . 
 You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . 

Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . 
 Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? 
 No problem . See you ! 

I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . 
 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . 
 Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 
 Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . 
 You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . 
 You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! 
 Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? 
 Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . 
 Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . 
 You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . 

If only our company prescribe flex time . 
 Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . 

Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . 
 Manchester United . What about you ? 
 I have confidence in them . 
 Yes . 
 No problem . What should I bring ? 

I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . 
 What do you mean ? 

How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 

It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . 
 China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . 
 Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . 
 Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents . 

What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? 
 What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? 
 You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? 

Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . 
 To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . 
 After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . 
 Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . 
 That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . 
 The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... 

Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason . 
 But what ? 

Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . 
 I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . 
 I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . 
 Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . 
 I'm sure management is on top of it . 
 Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... 
 What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? 
 Great ! 
 Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... 
 Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . 
 The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . 
 It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . 
 Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . 
 The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? 

I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . 
 What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? 
 Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 That is a big family . How old is your sister ? 
 What about your brother ? 
 Do you miss your family ? 
 Do you often go home ? 
 How often do you write to them ? 

I really should be on my way . 
 No , thanks all the same . 
 Thank you very much . We really had a good time . 
 So see you . 

Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! 
 Not bad . At least I am still alive . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 
 You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . 

Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . 
 I don't want to make a bad impression . 
 I will . 
 I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? 
 What's the extension number for my phone ? 
 Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? 
 I understand . 

Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? 
 I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? 
 My pleasure . 
 A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . 
 Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . 
 Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . 
 Okay . 
 Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . 
 Bye , Ann ! 
 It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind . 
 I missed today's weather for cast in the radio 
 The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport 

Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? 
 Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . 
 Why don't you take a few days off ? 

How about having a cup of tea with us ? 
 Would you like to go to the cinema with me ? 

Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike . 
 Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
 Thanks . I will ask him . 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , they are fine . They are enjoying their retirement . 
 Say hi to your family for me . 

Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? 
 You know , about David and new boss . 
 Well , I hear David have been fired . 

What is the correct time , please ? 
 When will you lecture begin ? 

Oh my god ! It's 10:00 pm . I have to go . 
 I am afraid not . 
 Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in . 
 Yes , sure . Have a sweet dream ! 
 All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . 
 Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . 
 Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . 
 Not a bad idea . 
 Well , let ’ s see . I ’ d like to go to see the Summer Palace . 

Do you like traveling ? 
 Where did you visit ? 
 How did you like it ? 
 Where did you go there . 
 And do you have friend there ? 
 You must enjoy yourself . 

Could you tell me the right time , please ? 
 You have to go and fix it . 

May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . 

Great party , isn't it ? 
 This is my first , I only met jane last week . she and I teach at the same school . 
 Yeah , history , what about you ? 
 Salesman ?

Good afternoon , would you mind if I sat here ? 
 I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? 
 Do you like this place ? 
 How often ? 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Do you like swimming ? 

I just dropped in to say goodbye . 
 I ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock . 
 Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . 
 Yes , He had just bought a new motorcycle . 
 Yes , I tried it and I quite liked it . 
 Sure . But I still liked it . 
 No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle . 
 Because bicycles are safer . 
 In that case , I won ’ t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime . 
 See you later . 
 Good morning Mr . Li 
 Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed 
 Really . For me too . 
 Not at all . 
 You are welcome at any time . 
 You are most welcome . 
 Call us as soon as you got home . 
 Fine , just fine.Thanks . 
 Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . 
 Oh . Yes . It is 
 That ’ s a good idea 
 It ’ s mild . but it ’ s not always pleasant . 
 I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics 
 Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? 
 What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? 
 Is it very cold in winter there ? 
 Does it rain a lot in summer there ? 
 How about here in Beijing ? 
 I feel it ’ s rather dry here 
 Are you from south ? 
 I see . So this is your hometown ? 
 Oh . it ‘ s a case flowers . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I love flowers you know . Thank you very much . 

How nice it is here 
 I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year 

I ’ d better be going . 
 I wish I could , but It ’ s already late .

Merry Christmas ! 
 Are you doing anything special ? 
 Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
 Ok . Where should we go ? 
 Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . 
 Thanks.You too ! 
 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 

Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . 
 It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 What is very difficult to gather team player together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 

What ’ s the matter , BOB ? 
 What happened ? 
 Can you stand ? 
 what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat . 
 It maybe worse than it seems . 
 Yeah . 
 China . 
 China beat Brazil three to zero . 

Bob ! 
 Fine , just fine.And you ? 
 Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . 
 Better take the subway . It ’ s faster and more convenient . 
 We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway . Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy . 
 Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . 
 Where can I get the subway Madam ? 
 Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ? 

Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . 
 I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie . 
 Certainly.What time will you come back ? 
 How many in your party ? 
 All right.We are waiting for you at seven . 
 Er ... Hum ... Got it . 
 Right ! 
 I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
 I ’ m afraid this seat is taken . 
 You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? 

Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . 
 That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 
 I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . 
 Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . 
 Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . 

Hi , Tim , any news about your job interview ? 
 Oh , what a pity ! 

Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 

Did you hear peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 

What are you doing over the weekend ? 
 I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . 
 Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how to goes . 
 Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . 
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . 
 Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 

Hey , Paul , why the long face ? 
 Try me . 
 Take it easy , maybe tomorrow will be different . 
 Cheer up , I hope you'll feel better soon . 
 Yes , I am.You must be Tom.Nice to meet you . 
 Be careful , Tom.Those are pretty heavy . 

Here , Let me get the door for you . 
 Do you need a hand with that ? 
 Don't worry about it . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 

Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 

What day is today ? 
 Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas . 

I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 

What time is it , Tom ? 
 Is it ? I have no idea if I ’ m so late . I must be off now . 
 I must catch the nine-thirty Train . 

Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 Why not . If I were you , I certainly would . 
 As the saying goes , work value work , play value play . All work and no play make a jucky-dull boy , you know . 

Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ? 
 How about going to a concert ? 

Hello , Elitherbeth How are you ? 
 Are you sure you ’ re alright . You look a bit worry today ? Is anything wrong ? 
 of course if I can . 
 Oh dear . That ’ s terrible . What was in your wallet ? 
 Well , If I were you , I would go to the police station straight away and calling . 
 Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ? 
 I think you should put an advertisement in china daily . Things where you lasted . 
 Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . 
 I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance . 
 You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say pretty woman . 

It ’ s going to a volleyball match between the economic department and foreign language department this afternoon . Are any of you keen on volleyball ? 
 I ’ m afraid not . My favorite is boots-running . I don ’ t care about games . 
 Oh , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve had a date already . 
 May be some other time . 
 How about going to the theatre ? 
 Well , what do you like doing ? 
 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . 
 Do you want to go to an Exhibition ? There ’ s one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow . 

Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? 
 You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . 
 Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . 
 Well , I like to play the piano . 
 About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . 
 Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 

Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? 
 No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . 
 What's the temperature today anyway ? 

How long have you been in Taiwan ? 
 So , where did you grow up ? 
 I am not sure , where exactly is it ? 
 No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . 
 I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . 
 Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . 
 About two years now . 
 Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . 
 About three times a week if I can . 
 Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . 
 I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . 
 I will , do you want me to bring anything ? 

hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? 
 He is cute.What dose he do ? 
 Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? 

I am having a hard time at my job . 
 My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . 
 But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . 
 Tell that to my boss . 
 Yes . 
 He was also assassinated because of his views . 
 Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . 

So , how's your work ? 
 I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . 
 But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . 
 That's why I am going to leave . 
 I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 I wish I could , but I can't . 
 Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . 

Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . 
 Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . 
 No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . 
 I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . 
 Do I ? Oh , no . 
 What about Mr.White ? 
 Thanks a lot , Eve . Goodbye . 
 Yeah , I've been working so much overtime lately . 
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult . 
 I know , but hard work pays off . You know . 
 Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for . 
 No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . 
 Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? 
 That's nice . Where is his villa ? 
 Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . 
 I know , but I am a work maniac . 
 Have a nice weekend . 
 Did she mention anything else ? 
 See you . 
 Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? 
 I thought she'd be happy . 
 I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . 
 It's certainly a tight schedule . 
 At what time ? 
 Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? 
 So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? 
 Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . 
 I am a realist . 
 Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? 
 Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . 
 Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . 
 I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . 
 It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . 
 I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . 

You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . 
 Tim , please . Please be seated . 
 So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years ready for change ? 

You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . 

Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . 
 Can you make it on Tuesday ? 
 Anytime after six will be fine .

 What ’ s the time ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you 
 Good bye ! 
 Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . 
 He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . 
 Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ? 

Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ? 
 Where do you come from ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s right.SO what are you studying ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Yes , certainly.How can I help you ? 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. 
 Certainly not.Here it is . 

Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . 
 Thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ? 
 All right . I only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way . 
 Thanks a lot , bye bye . 

Hello , Green here . 
 Oh , yes . 
 I'll be please to if I can . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I think I can help you . Why not you come around and see me ? Do you know my office ? 
 Good , where are you now ? 
 oh , well , that's just a few minutes walk to my office , come around and see me now . 
 Not at all . 
 Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . 
 I prefer sea food . 
 That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . 
 bye . 
 Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . 
 It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . 
 How about you ? When are you leaving for Berkeley ? 
 So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . 
 Saturday is fine . I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o ’ clock . Is that ok ? 
 Great . I'll pick you up at six thirty . 

Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ? 
 Two years or so . 
 No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . 
 It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . 
 Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . 

Hey , Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I am just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? 
 Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . 
 I ’ d totally die if she turned me down . 
 I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ? 
 Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . 
 No . I've been visiting relatives recently . 
 I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco . 
 No . Why ? 
 Great . Let's talk over coffee . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 So ? 
 You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? 
 That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 
 And you think about her all the time ? 
 And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . 
 Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ’ Ve found your soul mate . 
 Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . 
 While staying in love is even better . 
 We are not seeing each other any more . 
 Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time . 
 I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea ! 

Has Alan shown up yet ? 
 I wonder what happened . 
 Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital . 
 His sister had a car accident last week . 
 She is still in a coma . 

How's your mother doing ? 
 That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon . 

The world changes , the family changes too . 
 People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . 
 I don't like such a family . 
 I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . 
 We can live well , I think . 
 Yeah , it's must for me . 
 I won't , mom . 
 I will . Bye , mom . 

What newspaper are you reading ? 
 Why don't you read the local newspaper ? 
 New York Times is better ? 

Do you like music ? 
 Do you think the music is well-matched ? 
 How about the words of the song ? 
 I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings . 
 Of course , and I also like the rhythms . 
 Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying . 

Did you have any hobbies ? 
 What kind of books do you like to read most ? 
 Are you in love ? 
 People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories . 

Hi , Ben . Here are the top ten of this week's top chart . 
 Which is your favorite in this ten ? 
 You mean Sweet Heart . 
 What do you think about Cold Wind ? 
 So No . 4 is your favorite . Which one don't you like ? 
 Why ? 
 Really ? But it's my favorite . 
 Yes , and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back ? 
 That's 35 yuan each . 
 Tarzan . 
 I am afraid not . Tomorrow is premiere . 
 I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . 
 I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . 
 The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . 
 Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . 
 Why do you think so ? 
 You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . 
 Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . 
 I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . 
 No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . 
 I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? 
 I hope so , too . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 Do you have any English songs ? 
 Let me have a look . Everything I do I do it for you 、 Unchained melody 、 My heart will go on . Oh , and I ’ d like to try Everything I do I do it for you . 
 Is it easy to locate it ? 
 I used to be a better singer . I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time . It's your turn . 
 That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . 
 You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? 
 No way . I'd rather go to another movie house . 
 All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ? 
 Shall we take a chance ? 
 It's moving so slow . 
 I don't think anyone will . 

Merry Christmas , Lily . 
 This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . 
 Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . 
 It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . 
 For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . 
 Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . 
 Photograph . 
 Olympus . 
 No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements . 
 Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . 
 No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 
 How much did you want to spend ? 
 Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . 
 Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now . 
 Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . 

Happy new year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate ’ s having a party . 
 Is she coming ? 
 They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . 
 I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? 
 Name it and I'll do it for you . 
 I've got it . 
 I am just doing what I think I should do . 
 This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business . 

The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . 
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 
 I am so happy for them . 
 Yes , I always cry at weddings . 
 Yes , they are . 
 In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . 
 No , no , for the engagement . 

Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . 
 But what are the sources of water pollution ? 
 Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? 
 But what about the indirect ones ? 
 I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . 

Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . 
 People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . 

I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . 
 How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! 

Are you a happy married man ? 
 You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . 
 You mean she bosses her husband around ? 

I hear Jean married a business tycoon . 
 But I don't think she really loves him . 
 If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . 

The Blacks got divorced . 
 Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side . 
 No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . 
 No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up . 

Hi , Mike . We're having a party tonight , wanna come join us ? You can bring your girlfriend . 
 What happened ? Did you have a fight ? 
 Yeah , she is . She is pretty , caring , getting easy-going and she is a great cook . She is a gem . 
 Oh ? ! Did you talk with her about it ? 
 So , when are you going to tell her ? 
 I know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt ! 

Hi , Is that David ? 
 Hey , what's new ? 
 Sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . 
 Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . 
 Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? 
 But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . 
 The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . 

Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? 
 Aug 8 . 
 Mrs . White . 
 Maybe her uncle will . 
 Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . 
 Yes , Jane says they will go to China . 
 Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You really think so ? 
 I sure hope so . 
 I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . 
 They say you shouldn't mix love and work . 
 You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . 
 That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . 
 You are sounding like we are already married . 
 Well , I don't feel right about it . 
 Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? 
 Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! 
 Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . 
 In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . 

I'd like to meet you again sometime . 
 Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 Bye , Jason . 
 Thank you . 
 She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . 
 Thank you . 
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . 
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . 
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . 
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 
 My poor memory . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . 
 Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . 

Tom , did you see the film last night ? 
 Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
 Well , i don't see the point of arguing this . 
 Oh , hi ! 
 Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? 
 Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? 
 I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? 
 Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . 
 See you around ! 

Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto . 
 A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . 

If you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . It's extremely bad for your health , you know . 
 Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . 

You look run down , Brian . 
 Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . 
 Good idea . 
 It's easy to get loose bowels in summer . 
 You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat . 

Steve , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . 
 Is there anything I can do to help you ? 

Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . 
 Did it hurt ? 
 How long were you in the chair ? 
 Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . 
 Don't you have a dental insurance ? 

Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . 
 Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck . 
 Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . 
 Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . 

What did the doctor say ? 
 Did he give you any advice ? 
 Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . 
 We went to Malaysia and Thailand . 
 Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating . 
 It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . 
 You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? 
 But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? 
 What is crackers then ? 
 So they are two totally different concepts . 
 I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . 
 Thanks a lot . 

What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
 How hard is the climb ? 
 What did you do last week ? 
 Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . 
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! 

Hey , let's eat out tonight . 
 No . Just want to relax a little bit . You don't have to win the lottery to relax , do you ? 
 Come on . It's on me . 
 Don't be silly . I'll take you anywhere you wanna go . 
 Dream on ! 
 I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ? 
 Don't forget the sun block lotion . You don't want a sunburn , do you ? 

Aren ’ t you going to swim ? 
 You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? 
 What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? 
 All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . 
 Yes ? 
 I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? 

Did you go camping last Saturday ? 
 How many members were in your party in all ? 
 Did you get caught in the bad storm ? 

What kind of books do you like ? 
 Really ? Me too . 
 I prefer the novels by Hemingway , such as The Old Man and the Sea . I like the simple words in his novels . 
 Absolutely ! 
 Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . 
 I hope it's not gonna break into three digits 
 Well , I just hope it'll level off . 
 I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . 
 I met him through a computer bulletin board . 
 It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . 
 You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . 
 That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . 
 You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . 
 That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . 
 It sure is . 
 I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . 
 I know . I don't want to get sick , especially during finals week . 
 Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ? 
 It is the best season for a picnic right now . Have you decided the place for your picnic ? 
 What did the whetherman say ? 
 Well , I will think it over . 
 Yes , it's nice and bright . 
 I hope so too . 
 It's usually a bit hotter than today . 
 It's pretty cold and it often snows . 
 Let's hear the weather report later . What's the weather like in your hometown ? 
 That's quite a lovely weather . 
 Have you ever seen a hurricane ? 
 Do they often happen in your country ? 
 Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV . 
 How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card . 
 Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please . 

Did you hear how cold it got last night ? 
 It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . 
 Don't you have a garage ? 
 How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . 
 Does it ever get that cold on here ? 
 Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . 
 It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . 
 And the streets are covered with snow . 
 I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . 
 The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . 

Her dress looks funny . 
 Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . 
 Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . 
 No wonder you never buy me a new dress . 
 You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive . 
 Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? 
 Maybe make-up would be enough ? 
 But what would other people think ? 

They are professors and government officials . 
 Most of them are from America and Europe . 
 They are attending an international conference here . 
 They are staying at the Hilton Hotel . 
 I've never seen anything like it . 
 It ’ s pretty good . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food . 
 We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . 
 Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change ! 

Robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 And later ? 
 It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow . 
 I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house.How I envy you , Robin ! 
 Lizzy who ? 
 Of course I do . 
 You mean Mary ? 
 Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary . 
 Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too . 
 Why do you ask me these questions ? 

What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? 
 Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . 
 It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now . 
 Sorry , Mr . Polly . 
 Have a try . 
 You do ? 
 But I find Japanese ones better . 
 Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . 
 Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . 
 So you are . 
 I feel exactly the same way with you . 
 What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . 
 No . 
 I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . 
 Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? 
 Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club . 
 Well ... What are you interested in ? 
 Joanna , give me a break . 
 Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! 
 Of course I have . I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible . 
 I don't believe you can make it when you meet your Mrs . Right . 
 Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . 
 Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . 
 Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . 
 Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ? 
 I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ? 
 A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ? 
 Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . 
 Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . 
 Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show . 
 Yeah , if you ’ re a girl . 
 That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . 
 O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . 

You look so tan and healthy ! 
 How was it ? 
 Like what ? 
 I ’ m so jealous . 

Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? 
 Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? 
 Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? 
 Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? 

Hello , james . Come in . go through to the living room . 
 I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating . I finally saved enough and did everything at once . 
 Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . 
 Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there . 
 I know . I know . I don ’ t smoke too much , though . 
 About a pack , more if I drink . 
 No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years . 
 Yeah ... you ’ re right . I really should stop smoking . 
 But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . 
 How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . 
 It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 . 
 Mike suggests me to return it . 

Guess what ! 
 I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend . 

We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . 
 Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat . 

Don't you have too much to do with him . 
 His father is a prisoner . 

Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 

How long have you been in China ? 
 How do you think of living here ? 

Do you know how to play go ? 
 But I heard it is very difficult to play . 

Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ’ t like it there . 
 The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time . 
 Yeah , is your club different ? 
 Do they have a lot of equipment ? 
 Sounds nice . What about classes ? 
 Wow , that sounds great . 
 Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work . 
 O . K . , see you . 
 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? 
 Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . 

Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . 
 That's what I'm wondering , too . 

Have you seen Harry ? 
 Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . 

Are you coming or not ? 
 Well , make up your mind . We need to know . 

How are your parents these days ? 
 Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . 

How is your business going ? 
 Really ? Maybe I should work for you . 

Would you mind if I use your tape-recorder ? 
 I'll give it back to you in a couple of days . 

So how long have you known Mary ? 
 Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . 

What musical instrument do you play ? 
 Then we can have one more program at our party ? 

I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . 
 And all of the flowers are in bloom . 

Who do you think will win the championship ? 
 There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? 

Why you are so crazy about Beijing Opera ? It's so boring . 
 Maybe you're right . But I just still can't understand ... 

Hi , Mary . You look pale today . What's the matter with you ? 
 You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest . I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon . 

Would you like to drink some coffee ? 
 Would you like to try some watermelon juice ? It tastes good . 

Has your family lived here for long ? 
 You have a fantastic view . 
 Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . 

I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths . 
 I ’ m so thirsty . 
 No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink . 
 Oh ! Thank you . 
 But , we just finished eating lunch . 
 I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming . 
 Yes , we're all proud of her ! 
 Cheers ! 
 Just so-so . Where did you get it ? 
 I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . 
 Yes . What will you do these two days ? 
 But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . 
 Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature . 
 You bet . You should try it yourself . 
 Me , too . I've heard so much about you . 
 I was looking forward to your arrival . 
 Not great . It's a kind of boring . 
 Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . 
 Yeah . There's nobody in sight . 
 I think you're right . Let's go . 
 Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now . 
 I know one . Let's go . 
 No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow . 
 Yeah . I need to . 
 I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV . 
 Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . 
 Of course we have . It's on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month . 
 It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day . 
 No , not really . 
 Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . 

Mary , do you remember when we met ? 
 And I came up and asked to sit by you ... 

I don't like the merry-go-round . 
 Ok , I guess it's worthy of two yuan . 

Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
 Let's make a bet on who gets it . 

Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ? 
 Haven't you ever seen him working late ? 

Do you do morning exercises ? 
 Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? 

Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S . 
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 

Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ? 
 What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months . 

Would you like to go to the natural history museum with me ? 
 Yes , lots of time . I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have . 

Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone . 
 It's a big jump in science . Maybe more like a leap . 

I can't decide what I should do . 
 Should I date Tom or should I date Harry ? 

Do you like to dance ? 
 What kind of dancing do you like ? 

Do you really have to work today ? 
 But you'll miss out on the football game . 

So did you get in touch with your brother ? 
 Well , it'd be foolish to call the police . He probably just went away overnight . 

How about a game of tennis ? 
 It's a deal . 

Here's 30 yuan for my ticket . 
 No , you can't do that . 

Have you seen any good movies lately ? 
 Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student . 

Good afternoon , would you mind if I sit here ? 
 I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? 
 Do you like this place ? 
 How often ? 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Do you like swimming ? 

Jill , how do you like your new job ? 
 I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . 
 Sure , I think I know the place . 
 That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? 
 Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . 
 Well I wish you luck . 
 Bread . 
 Orange juice . 
 I think mutton is best . 
 I like champagne . 
 Banana of course . 
 I always have meals outside , because I ’ m not good at cooking . 
 Just okay . 
 Good idea . 
 No , I can ’ t accept it . Business is business . 
 I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . 
 It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . 
 I haven ’ t decided yet . But I may go out . 
 I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan . 
 I don ’ t know . How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere . 
 By train or by plane ? 

Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . 
 No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? 

People say that you never have a real winter in the South China , but I don't think so . 
 I did experience a winter with snow in Kunming , the Spring City . 

Well , speak of the devil . 
 I was just thinking about you the other day . 

Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . 
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . 

Do you watch a lot of TV ? 
 Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . 

Are you sure you heard right ? 
 I don't believe you . 

I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? 
 I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . 

Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ? 
 How's he doing ? 
 He did ? That's too bad ! 
 Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him . 

Our team just scored a goal . 
 Tell me about it . 

So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 
 Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . 
 Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . 

I hear you're moving to New York . 
 Well , we'll certainly miss you in Boston . 
 Let's keep in touch . 

Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ? 
 I saw Emily yesterday evening . She was wearing a CD evening gown . She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 ! 

What's your number ? 
 Five . 
 You think it's funny . I'm terrified . 
 But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . 
 I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . 

Do you like ice skating ? 
 Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . 
 Friday then . How about it ? 
 It's settled then . 
 David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . 
 It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . 
 I just think the humor was too gross . There were too many disgusting things in it . I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny . 
 No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick . 
 I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ? 

I'd love to continue this conversation , but I really need to go now . I have to get back to the office . 
 Okay . Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? 
 Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday . I've got to fly to Chicago on business . 
 Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . 
 So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? 
 You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late . Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ? 
 I'm clipping coupons . 
 It's a good way to save money . 
 How much ? Last week I save $ 10 on food . 
 Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . 
 What are your hours ? 

Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . 
 Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ? 
 Is it a used one ? 
 Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . 
 Yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too . 
 Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . 
 Oh , about 10 miles . It takes me about an hour . 
 You ’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation , too . 
 See you . 
 Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college . 
 No , it ’ s last year ’ s model . 
 $ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car . 
 Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ? 
 Come on . 
 I trust you ’ re keeping well ? 
 So we can get down to business . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . 
 Not too good yet . Better than I was though . 
 Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? 
 Just as usual , you know . 
 Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ? 
 I didn ’ t think much of it . Are you ? 
 Sounds like fun . 
 Are you broke again ? Let me treat you . 
 You know , I am a waitress at the student center . Anyway now those final exams are almost over . I ’ d love a night out . 
 Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . 
 Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red . 
 Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool . 
 Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up . 
 Well , give me a call if you can ’ t make it for some reason . 
 Yeah , the air is really fresh . 
 Because it rained last night . 
 It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . 
 Well , it may rain again later today . 
 There may also be a strong wind coming in . 
 Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . 
 We've been planting trees for many years . 
 But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . 
 Spring is warm and short in Beijing . 
 You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . Don't forget to put on more clothes , or you might catch a cold . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . 
 Are you Chinese by birth ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 I want to study Mandarin and public relations . 
 It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . 
 Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . 
 I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . 
 Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . 
 Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . 
 I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . 
 I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . 
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 
 What happened with that guy at the cafe ? 
 But you ’ re crazy about him ? 
 Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? 
 Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail . 
 Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . 
 What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 

Does bullfight interest you much ? 
 So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 

So what kind of music turns you on ? 
 You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? 

Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? 
 I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . 
 My pleasure . 
 I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . 

Julie , is that you ? 
 Yes , it's me . And you're Julie Ashley . How are you ? 
 So do you ! How are you doing ? 
 Okay , let's sit over there . 
 Beg your pardon ? 
 Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is five minutes fast . So it should be three forty 
 Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ? 
 Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call . 
 Go ahead . 
 It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though . 

Who is this on the water buffalo ? 
 Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . 
 That's interesting . Go on ! 
 So he became a self-taught man ? 
 In what field ? 
 Is he still in that that type of work . 
 Would you want to be a senator ? 

He has lots of hobbies . 
 He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . 
 He lets his cousins look after his business . 

I ’ ll sing you a song . 
 Most of my songs are sad , sorry . 
 OK , I ’ ll sing San Francisco then . 
 Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting . 
 Yes . Let ’ s sleep on the sand . That ’ s most exciting ! 
 That's wonderful . Congratulations . 
 I'd love to . What date is it ? 
 What day is that ? 
 Yes , sure . What time will the wedding begin ? 
 Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck ! 

Sheila , what time should we meet tomorrow ? 
 What place ? 
 And what should I wear ? 
 What are you going to wear ? 
 Sheila , how about that fashionable blue dress ? 

Hello , Ellen . 
 Oh , no ! What happened ? 
 How awful ! Was he hurt ? 
 How did it happen ? 
 How horrible ! 
 I hope he ’ ll be all right . 

Hello , Lily . 
 When I come late , there ’ s usually nothing left . 
 I ’ ll have the leg of lamb . 

Is this your umbrella , miss ? 
 You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . 
 May I ask where you live ? 
 That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . 
 It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? 
 How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . 
 Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? 

Are the children all grown up now , Rose ? 
 Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . 
 Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl . 
 Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ? 
 Really ? Where does he live now ? 
 And does Rocky drive a truck , too ? 
 Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ? 

Mom ? 
 Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? 
 Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . 
 Thank God ! 
 Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along . 
 That has nothing to do with it ... 
 I do . 

And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof . 
 See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . 
 Nothing ? 
 You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me . 
 Come on . 
 What ? I thought you liked Patricia . 
 Seventy-six , I think . 
 Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs . 
 I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch . 

I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting . 

I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . 
 This is only your second time skiing . This is definitely a case of the blind leading the blind . 
 I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this . 
 No ! ! ! 
 Don ’ t hold your breath ! 
 One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . 
 Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills . 
 We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . 
 You know on a date , they are going to dinner . 
 Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . 
 That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? 
 I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . 
 I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya . 

We thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal . 
 That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . 
 That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? 
 So will I . Thank you . 
 I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes . 
 See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down . 

What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? 
 Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? 
 Easy . It ’ s on me . 

Like to come over to our fancy dress party ? 
 Well , then join us some other time . 

Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? 
 So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess . 

Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . 
 Out of hand . 
 Where ’ d you meet him ? 
 About what ? 
 Excuse me ? 

Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . 
 Where ? 
 I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? 

How do you do ? I ’ m Parker . 
 Parker . 
 Yes , with a P . 
 Barker ? With a B . Of course . 
 Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ? 

He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . 
 What do you mean ? 

Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? 
 Does she teach Chinese ? 
 And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? 

What ’ s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy . 
 What happened ? 
 Your bag ? Did you get it back ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday . 
 Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow . 
 And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too . 

I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . 

How did you two meet ? 

Hi , Bill . 
 Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks . 
 Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? 

I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss . 

My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . 

If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . 

Thank you for your letter . 
 Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . 
 And I was glad to receive your letter . 
 I will be back again next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . 
 I don't know . It's a rental . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 Is it expensive ? 
 Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ? 
 Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ? 
 Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it . 
 Not anymore . Now I work nine hours a day , and I get a good sleep almost every night . No more burning the candle at both ends . 
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . 
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! 
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! 

Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? 
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 
 Sounds nice . 
 Can I stop by ? 

We have to pick up Conrad before the party . 
 We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 
 Yes . 
 Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? 
 Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . 
 Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in . 
 You sound like you're afraid . 
 You've never been in a gay bar before ? 
 But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic . 
 Listen . If you refuse to go in , Conrad will be offended.You don't hate gay people , do you ? 
 Don't worry about it . There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . 
 I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? 

You're late . 
 My phone ? 
 Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . 
 But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . 
 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 
 Do you have a cell phone ? 
 Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . 
 Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . 
 Yes , let's go . 
 Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . 
 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . 
 You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . 
 Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . 
 That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! 
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 

Honey , do you have a second ? 
 We need to talk . 
 I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . 
 That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for ! 
 Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . 
 I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . 
 Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . 
 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . 
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 
 Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... 
 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? 
 Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . 

That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 
 I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? 
 Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 
 I'll have a cup of tea . 
 Actually , could I have some milk with that ? 
 Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . 
 I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . 
 She's on the M40 , near Reading . 
 I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . 
 Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . 
 I will . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . 
 It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . 
 Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . 
 I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . 
 If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . 
 Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! 

Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 How old is he today ? 
 Well , wish him a happy birthday for me . 
 I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . 
 Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . 
 Sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? 
 Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . 
 Likewise . See you later . 

What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? 
 I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? 
 What other kind of music do you listen to ? 
 To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . 
 I like pop music . Do you ? 
 I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . 
 I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? 
 So , how did you become interested in it ? 
 Do you still play piano ? 

Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . 
 It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . 
 What did the critic say ? 
 The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . 
 I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . 
 I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . 
 right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . 
 that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
 not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo 
 well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? 
 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th 
 I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no 
 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
 I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . 
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 

what did you do over the weekend ? 
 do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? 
 like what ? 
 what else can we do to protect the environment ? 
 how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? 
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? 
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! 

Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? 
 No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . 
 I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . 
 Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . 
 Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . 
 No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! 

how are you doing ? 
 what happened to him ? 
 was it his first offence ? 
 what happened to him then ? 
 did they take his license away ? 
 what do you think will happen to him ? 
 that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? 
 my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . 

Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? 
 How would you solve the problem ? 
 It would probably be very expensive . 
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 
 Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . 
 Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly 
 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 
 That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . 
 I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact 
 Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . 
 There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your 

I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . 
 I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . 
 No-one really believes gossip columnists . 
 I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . 
 I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . 
 Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . 
 Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . 
 Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . 
 I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . 
 Of course ! I bought two copies . 

I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 
 No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin 
 I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . 
 Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . 
 What is it ? 
 Yes . 
 Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ? 
 Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? 
 Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? 
 Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? 
 I'm really looking forward to reading your column . 
 Sure , where would you like to go ? 

I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? 
 I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . 
 I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . 
 You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . 

Are you interested in history ? 
 I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . 
 Some people say that history repeats itself . 
 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . 

London is such a historic city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of 
 Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . 
 She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . 
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . 
 Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! 
 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 
 I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . 
 I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . 
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 

The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . 
 I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 
 I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . 
 I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? 
 I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . 
 Do you have a brand preference for anything ? 
 What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? 
 I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! 

Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? 
 Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? 
 Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 
 To be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . 
 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . 
 Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? 
 It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? 
 That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? 
 Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ? 

So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? 
 That's the Return of the King , right ? 
 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . 
 No . did you ? 
 Yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . 
 Most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . 
 I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . 

Hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? 
 You're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink . 
 Whatever you prefer . 
 Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? 
 I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . 
 One glass of red wine coming up ! 
 There's just going to be 6 of us tonight . 
 Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . 
 I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that . 
 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 
 I bet you find the character difficult to write ! 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 
 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 
 OK ! 
 Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! 
 Your future husband ! 

Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? 
 That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? 
 That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . 

Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? 
 We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . 
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . 

Hey Nick , what are you up to ? 
 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . 
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! 
 Let ’ s do it ! 
 I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! 
 What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
 Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . 
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 
 All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! 
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
 It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! 
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
 I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! 
 That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! 
 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! 
 No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . 
 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . 
 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa 
 This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g 
 Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec 
 Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 
 I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? 
 It ’ s about time ! 
 I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! 
 Banker ? 
 Can I have my $ 200 please ? 

Nice day today , isn't it ? 
 We can't complain about the weather recently . 
 I wonder how long this weather can last . 

What's the weather forecast for today ? 
 Any rain ? 
 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Really ? Good luck for them . 
 They're both very well , thanks . 
 I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me ? 
 It's been nice talking to you . 

Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A 
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 
 And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . 
 What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! 

Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started ! 
 Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! 
 A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! 
 A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! 
 Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 

Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . 
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
 I don't want to do that to you , Karen . 
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
 I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
 I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
 Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 

Hi . What's up ? 
 Not too much . I've been pretty busy . 
 Gotta go . Call me tonight . 

Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . 
 Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . 
 Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . 
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . 

There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . 
 It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . 
 No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " 
 Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . 
 Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . 
 That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . 
 Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . 
 Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . 
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . 
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . 
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . 
 Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . 
 What happened ? 
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? 
 Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . 
 Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . 
 Hehe .. sure 
 Yeah how ’ d you know ? 
 Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . 
 Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . 
 Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! 

I ’ m forming a music band . 
 Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . 
 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? 
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 

This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 For example ? 
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 
 Well , I have no regrets ! 

Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 
 You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! 
 Fine ! 
 Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! 
 Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! 
 You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . 
 Well , I don ’ t know . 
 Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! 

Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? 
 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 
 My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! 
 If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! 
 Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . 
 I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . 
 Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . 

Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! 
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . 
 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 

Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? 
 Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! 
 Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . 
 Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! 
 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 
 Yeah . I know . 
 You know , I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Honey ... 
 Baby , I love you so much . 
 I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Come on . Put the gun down . 

Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . 
 Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . 
 Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! 
 How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . 
 Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . 

Where to , miss ? 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 
 Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! 
 I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . 
 Uh ... yeah .. of course ! 
 Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! 
 Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . 
 Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . 
 That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . 
 Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . 
 Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! 
 Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . 
 Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . 
 Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . 
 Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? 
 I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? 

Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 No , I don't . So I need some help . 
 Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . 
 What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . 
 I'm ready . 
 I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . 
 Alright . Great . 
 Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? 
 I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . 
 What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . 
 Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . 
 Why ? We just got here . 
 12 
 Yes . 
 But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? 
 Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . 
 They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . 
 Yes . 
 I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . 
 That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . 
 You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . 
 It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . 

I'm going over to the gym . I want to do some running . 
 Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? 
 No , it's not . Not at all . I'd probably freeze my lungs . 
 You ? 
 I didn't know you could exercise . 
 Yeah , I know . But you ? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . 
 You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! 
 I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . 
 It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . 
 But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . 
 It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... 
 I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . 
 Nervous ? Why ? 
 Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . 
 Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . 
 Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . 
 Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . 
 There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . 
 No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . 
 That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . 
 It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . 
 Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? 
 Why ? I think the meeting went well . 
 Yes . But what are you worried about ? 
 Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? 
 I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . 
 Yes . 
 You mean because you are a woman ? 
 Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . 
 I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . 
 Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . It's no problem.Are you American ? 
 No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? 
 I don't think so . You are flattering me . 
 Are you flying home ? 
 You were visiting Taiwan ? 
 Really ! You live in Taiwan ! 
 May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? 
 Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? 
 It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan . 
 No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ? 
 Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? 
 Where will it be ? 
 Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? 
 Great . 
 You seem excited about it . 
 Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . 
 The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? 
 Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . 
 Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . 
 Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on ! 
 No , wait , you will be too cold without mittens . 
 Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . 
 Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go . 
 Yes , honey ... 

There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? 
 Why ? 
 Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . 
 Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? 
 The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . 

Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 
 That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! 
 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! 
 You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! 
 Why would that be funny ? 
 Why ? 
 I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . 
 Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . 
 Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! 

Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! 
 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
 I know . I know ! 
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! 

Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 
 Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . 
 Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . 
 OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! 
 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 

Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse ! 

Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? 
 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 

Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 
 Wow ! What a hit ! 
 Is he ok ? 
 I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . 
 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 

Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! 
 I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 
 I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . 
 Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? 
 About 80 million dollars . 

Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 
 What ’ s the score ? 
 So Baltimore is winning ? 
 This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . 
 The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . 
 Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . 
 Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . 
 Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! 
 Here comes Jordan , though . 
 Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . 
 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 
 O . K . See you . 
 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . 
 Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special . 
 Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ? 
 Okay . That ’ ll be 80 bucks . 

Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . 
 Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
 Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . 
 No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . 
 I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it . 
 Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . 
 I ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty . 
 Great , I ’ ll see you then . 

Welcome back , soccer fans . My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my commentating wingman , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds . 
 No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick . 
 This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick . He shoots ! and he ... 
 Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! 
 Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? 
 I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . 
 With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . 
 This one ? 
 Oh , right . This one , right ? 
 Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! 

We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! 
 That is preposterous ! 
 I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! 

Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . 
 That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! 
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . 

I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . 

Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? 

What's bothering that guy ? 

Do you think you will ever work at that company again ? 

That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? 

All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! 

How was your business trip ? 

Did you understand question number three ? 

I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . 
 But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . 
 You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? 
 No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? 
 Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? 
 That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? 

Will you be at the family reunion next year ? 

Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ? 
 See ? I told you . It's very hard . 
 Fifty times ? 
 And how much did it cost to rent it ? 
 Well , that's not too bad then . 
 Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . 
 Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . 
 I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . 
 No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . 
 Sure . What ? 
 But I always wanted to try it . 
 Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? 
 No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there . 
 The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . 
 Right there . 
 Yes , it's Mel Gibson . 
 I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? 
 Why not ? 
 That's okay . I can explain a little . 
 Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . 
 Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? 
 That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . 
 But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . 
 So how much do you want to gamble ? 
 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? 
 That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . 
 You can buy some of these nice butterflies . 
 What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? 
 Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . 
 How much are they ? 
 If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? 
 Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . 
 Let's go ask about it . 
 Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? 
 I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . 
 I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines . 
 So what do you want to play then ? 
 Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! 
 Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too ! 
 Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . 
 But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . 
 Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . 
 You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... 
 do you hear something ? 
 I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . 
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 
 He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... 
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 
 Yeah ? 

I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! 
 Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! 
 No , fireworks are awesome ! 
 I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . 
 Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? 
 Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... 
 Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . 
 The Bulls , of course ! 
 Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . 
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! 
 This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! 

I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . 
 Perfect ! 
 Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... 
 I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . 
 And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? 
 I ’ Ve heard this one before . 
 Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . 

I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! 
 Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! 
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! 
 That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? 

Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out ! 
 Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? 
 I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies . 
 Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ’ clock meeting . 
 Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . 
 What--is tomorrow night something special ? 
 I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . 
 Do you feel like dancing ? 
 Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . 
 No , maybe they're not . But they're close . 
 Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . 
 The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? 
 No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . 
 Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . 
 It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? 
 Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? 

Nick ! How ’ s it going ? 
 What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? 
 It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . 
 Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? 
 Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
 Oh , yes , it was very interesting . 
 Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . 
 Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . 
 That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . 
 Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . 
 So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . 
 As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . 
 That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . 
 I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . 
 No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . 
 Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . 
 I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . 
 Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . 
 Why do you say " have to " ? 
 Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . 
 Do you want me to give you a ride ? 
 Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you . 

The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay . 

Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic . 

Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? 

He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? 

Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . 

I feel I work harder when I am under pressure . 

There has been talk at school about canceling the concert . 
 Just word of mouth . 
 No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
 Great minds think alike . 
 Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . 
 I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . 
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . 
 You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
 It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? 
 Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . 
 You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . 
 Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . 
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s 
 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
 It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . 
 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . 
 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 

Do you believe in UFO's ? 
 I've never thought about it like that before . 
 Do you think that there's life on other planets ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? 
 I suppose you're right . 
 Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? 

I haven't met you at the gym for a long time . 
 why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . 
 then SOHO is your ideal work style . 
 and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . 
 sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? 
 it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit . 

Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? 
 Why ? What was it about ? 
 A lot of young people have to do that . 
 lt sounds like the story of my life . 
 I take sleeping pills sometimes . 
 It sounds a very depressing film . 
 I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . 
 Sounds good . Where are we going ? 
 Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? 
 Whew ! That getup is terrific ! 
 That too . 
 If you're lucky , that might do the trick . 
 Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? 
 I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . 

What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . 
 come on , nothing can be that bad . 
 ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? 
 really ? Is he married ? 
 then what's your problem ? 
 oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . 
 office romance is very tricky . 
 cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . 
 Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . 
 YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . 
 On second thought , I think I'll join you . 
 Wow , they really went to town on this place ! 
 Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . 
 how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ? 
 yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better 
 definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . 

how's it going ? 
 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 sure , but how ? 
 but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 easier said than done . 
 but I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 

Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? 
 good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . 
 is everything ready now ? 
 have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
 it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
 my pleasure . 
 to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! 
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
 yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . 
 that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 
 what should I bring with me ? 
 I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . 
 I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? 
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 
 ok , where and when should I meet you ? 

have you ever been to Disneyworld ? 
 the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . 
 well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . 
 some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . 
 thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? 
 for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . 
 even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? 
 thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . 

Jack and Mary broke up . 
 Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . 
 how so ? 
 poor Mary ! She really liked him . 
 do you think they ’ ll get back together ? 
 I hope she ’ ll recover soon . 

how do you usually get to school ? 
 I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . 
 I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . 
 do you have a car ? 
 maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . 
 that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . 
 I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! 
 sounds good ! Let's go ! 
 are you serious ? 
 but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 but I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... 
 I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . 
 shall we keep Our friendship ? 

hello , Deva , how are you ? 
 not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . 
 you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . 
 we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . 

what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? 
 I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? 
 what other kind of music do you listen to ? 
 to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . 
 I like pop music . Do you ? 
 I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . 
 I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? 
 so , how did you become interested in it ? 
 do you still play piano ? 

do you have any plans for Friday night ? 
 well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ? 
 the more , the merrier ! 
 I sure hope so . We've each invited about 10 people . 
 I'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school . 
 don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself . 
 most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm . 
 we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . 
 that'd be great . I'll see you then ! 
 sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . 
 should I take my shoes off ? 
 this is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? 
 sure , what do you have ? 
 I'll have a glass of red wine please . 
 so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? 
 oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? 
 that's too bad.They ' re such good company . 
 excuse me while I go and get that . 
 sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . 
 I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . 
 it's his 50th birthday . 
 sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? 
 well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . 
 sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . 
 sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . 
 say hello to your friends for me . 
 Bye ! 
 I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . 
 I see how that can get a bit annoying . 
 so what are you going to do about it ? 
 what do you think would make you happier ? 
 relationships can be confusing sometimes . 
 I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! 
 I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? 
 camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! 
 no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go . 
 do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? 
 that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? 
 so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . 
 actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University . 
 yes , I was planning on going . Are you ? 
 that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ? 
 sounds great . see you then . 
 well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . 
 let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . 
 I went sky-diving ! 
 It was scary , but it felt great , too . 
 of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . 
 I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . 
 are you scared of anything ? 
 what do you think is going to happen ? 
 it sounds like you just need to be more careful . 
 I love just about anything by Prince . 
 well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? 
 do you have a favorite band ? 
 do you often go to concerts ? 
 I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? 
 I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . 
 let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . 
 sure , what's on ? 
 that sounds dreadful ! 
 no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway . 
 well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit . 
 that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ? 
 I'm in the middle seat . 
 thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . 
 no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ? 
 I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours . 
 that would be great . thanks . 
 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 
 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
 I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . 
 Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . 
 Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . 
 no . It's all yours . 
 Carson . It's nice to mee you , too . 
 it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming . 
 so sure . Are you from around here ? 
 where are you from ? 
 I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . 
 I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? 
 Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? 
 no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? 
 well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you . 

Hi , Mike , what gives ? 
 Hey , great set of wheels . 
 Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . 
 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 
 I can imagine . 
 I'd love to . 

Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 
 Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? 
 Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . 
 Wow , this's sinking a hole . 
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 
 Wow , this car can really burn rubber . 
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 

Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . 
 Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? 
 A little , I wish I could do that . 
 Look at him , he's buff . 
 How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? 
 That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . 

Hi Paul . How are you , friend . 
 How so ? 
 Have you talk to him about it ? 
 Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight . 
 Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ? 
 Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ? 
 No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . 
 I'll get you for that comments , George . 
 ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . 
 All right . But so help me it's a better work . 
 Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired . 
 Well , that's not for me . 
 It wasn't as good as you think . 

You look like a basket case . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Yeah , and ? 
 Why ? 
 I guess you think twice next time he comes . 
 So how long has he here for ? 
 Well , I know you do the right thing . 
 good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? 
 that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . 
 what's that ? 
 that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . 
 just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 is there anything else bothering you ? 
 do you have any other plans this weekend ? 
 try not to take on more than you can handle . 

wow ! You're going to Tibet ? 
 that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . 
 nothing particular . 
 oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune . 
 ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? 
 then make sure that you book me a room , too . 
 and check whether they accept credit cards . 

how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? 
 as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? 
 you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . 
 taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
 you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . 
 besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . 
 good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! 
 to be honest , I was just dumped . 
 no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . 
 I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . 
 where is that ? 
 what's there to see ? 
 oh , sounds nice . 
 ok . Then I can make up my mind . 
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . 
 we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec 
 tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? 
 no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . 
 great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . 
 Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . 
 yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 
 hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . 
 yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! 
 are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? 
 yeah , I think so . 
 wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . 
 not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
 well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a 
 there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 

We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? 
 what about a factory tour ? 
 yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 exactly . 
 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
 oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . 
 it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . 
 take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . 
 you ’ re welcome . 
 without traffic , it takes about an hour . 
 yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 
 my pleasure , and have a good time ! 
 yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 
 yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
 thanks ! 
 it was wonderful , but I was so tired . 
 yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . 
 art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . 
 yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . 
 on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . 
 you'll have to try for yourself some day . 
 is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 
 yeah , that's nice . 
 a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? 
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 
 I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? 
 that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? 
 you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? 
 congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! 
 ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! 
 ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . 
 that's thoughtful of you . 
 that's right ! I almost forgot about that . 
 we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! 
 yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? 
 if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . 
 the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . 
 I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . 
 not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . 
 do you have an iPod ? 
 why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? 

what are you looking for ? 
 do you know what camcorder options are available ? 
 would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? 
 ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? 
 it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . 
 yes , that is an option . 
 yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . 
 It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . 
 there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . 

what's up ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 Are you using dial-up or broadband ? 
 In that case , you need to turn on your airport . 
 do you like ever chat online ? 
 Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . 
 well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . 
 it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . 
 don't mention it . 
 what's that ? 
 have you read it yet ? 
 go on , read it out loud . 
 when did you send her a letter ? 
 I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . 
 that's fine with me . 
 well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . 
 are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? 
 oh , I guess I missed that . 

Is that your phone ? 
 it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 
 no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
 does it have a camera ? 
 I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . 
 have you checked your voicemail recently ? 
 I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . 
 do you want to listen to your messages first ? 
 I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . 
 it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . 
 it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! 

do you like playing games ? 
 how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? 
 if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . 
 I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! 
 hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . 
 do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? 
 I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! 
 if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . 
 ok . 
 pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . 
 if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . 
 whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . 
 my boss . 
 she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . 
 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . 
 she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . 
 she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . 
 that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . 
 I will do . 
 sure . 
 well , you are a very hard-worker . 
 there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? 
 that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . 
 that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . 
 of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . 
 you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . 
 no , of course not . Go ahead . 
 yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . 
 What did you do after high school ? 
 I took a year off to go travelling . 
 I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? 
 Oh , did you study a foreign language ? 
 that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? 
 so you can speak Chinese ? 
 I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . 
 I'm off to Barcelona for a week . 
 yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? 
 that's good advice . 
 are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? 
 ok . I'll take that one then . 
 I like to travel light so I just have this one . 
 yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 

I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . 
 don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? 
 I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a 
 oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . 
 oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . 
 they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower . 
 we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . 
 that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 
 I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . 
 I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? 
 would you recommend going there for a few days ? 
 you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? 
 I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . 
 I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . 
 thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later . 
 Wow , what a great burd ! 
 She's a real turn-on our rights . 
 Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . 
 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . 
 Well , that's my opinion . 
 Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . 

welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 
 where did you end up going ? 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 
 sure . What's this one a picture of ? 
 you don't look very happy in that picture . 
 so what did you do ? 
 my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 
 that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
 everything's great . And you ? 
 no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . 
 yeah . I found it is so close to our life . 
 you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . 
 I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . 
 that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . 
 definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . 
 I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . 
 I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . 
 I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . 
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . 
 Yeah , a number of times . 
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . 
 You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . 
 that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . 
 I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . 
 well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? 
 or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . 
 you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . 
 they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , 
 that ' for sure but very few . 
 why ? Did tom pop the question ? 
 let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? 
 I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . 
 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . 
 simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . 
 he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . 
 yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . 
 not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . 
 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? 
 okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . 
 well , we can ask people to make small contributions . 
 BYOB ? What's that ? 
 so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . 
 oh , that sounds like fun ! 
 hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? 
 that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? 
 that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . 
 that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . 
 well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . 

hi , Natasha , how's life ? 
 oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . 
 yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . 
 the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da 
 yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . 
 thank you . 
 you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! 
 well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? 
 yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! 
 I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . 
 okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . 
 why ? 
 okay , here I go ! 

do you have internet in your room ? 
 really ? What do you usually do online ? 
 I never chatted online before . What's it like . 
 really ? Who do you chat with ? 
 that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . 
 don't worry . 
 just after 2 am . 
 nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . 
 I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? 
 I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c 
 me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there ! 
 talk to you later . 
 well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . 
 oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? 
 art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . 
 sure . I enjoy both of them very much . 
 once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . 
 it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . 
 yes , you can find almost all new releases there . 
 why not ? 
 is it a horror movie ? 
 no way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? 
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . 
 yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 the Notebook is this type of movie . 
 well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . 

Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 
 you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . 
 you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you 
 then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . 

our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . 
 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 
 no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . 
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . 
 no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t 

The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 you dance beautifully too . 
 in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 how about tango ? 
 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . 
 my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 

I really admire you , Diana . 
 you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . 
 isn't there anything else ? 
 you must have a high IQ score . 
 go ahead . 
 seriously ? But you are such a genius . 
 well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . 
 oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? 

hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . 
 nice to meet you too . 
 thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 
 oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . 
 there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
 that would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
 to be honest , I wouldn't . 
 not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . 
 my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
 yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . 
 but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . 
 you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . 
 I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . 

have you ever thought about your ideal home ? 
 what would it be like ? 
 how many rooms would it have ? 
 how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? 
 how would you decorate your house ? 
 how many TVs would your dream home have ? 

what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! 
 all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . 
 no problem . 
 do you know how to set the timer ? 
 OK , let's have a try . 
 did it come out ? 
 never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . 

finally we're on board ! 
 are they window seats or aisle seats ? 
 ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . 
 thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 
 good idea . 
 ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . 
 and no hijackers . 

is this seat taken ? 
 thanks . 
 yes , on a business trip . How about you ? 
 yes , I went there once last summer . 
 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
 yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . 
 that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 

Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ? 
 Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ? 

Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . 
 Where were you ? 

Matthew ? Hi ! 
 it's got to be almost a year now . 
 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
 not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
 Mrs . Thou ? 
 great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 

what's your apartment like ? 
 what is it like living in on-campus housing ? 
 did you have to pay a deposit ? 
 do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? 
 how long is your contract for ? 
 have you started looking again yet ? 
 Good luck ! 
 no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . 
 we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . 
 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
 I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
 you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . 
 I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . 
 I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . 
 my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
 well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . 
 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . 
 my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t 
 we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
 not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 he didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 
 thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . 

you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . 
 how did you meet each other ? 
 is this your first date ? 
 sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . 
 absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! 
 a guy I met on the internet three month ago . 
 please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . 

I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . 
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
 how dare you ! 
 why did you lie to me in the email ? 
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . 

hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 
 you mean the boy you met on MSN ? 
 you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! 
 I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . 
 did you tell him ? 
 you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . 
 I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . 
 many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try 
 my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 do you have any other symptoms ? 
 just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
 how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 
 how did you get that burn again ? 
 you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? 
 when's the last time you took your tablets ? 
 I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 
 sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? 
 soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . 
 I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . 
 not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . 
 could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? 
 ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . 
 I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . 
 just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . 
 shouldn't we make an appointment first ? 
 whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! 
 sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
 that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 
 if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? 
 you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . 
 the Taj it is then . 
 they'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
 don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . 
 no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . 

hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . 
 it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans 
 if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . 
 thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . 
 how about at 6 pm ? 

are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 
 yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . 
 that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . 
 I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . 
 do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . 
 when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . 
 nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 

does your family have a record of your ancestors ? 
 do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . 
 that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? 
 are you very close to your first-cousins ? 
 I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? 
 that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? 
 that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . 
 Actually , i popped in them last night . 
 Well , they're really beautiful people . 
 Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . 
 He is a professional football player . 
 Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful . 
 I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . 
 Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine . 
 no . what's it like ? 
 would you want to live there ? 
 what's your dreamhole like then ? 
 would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? 
 it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? 
 I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? 

Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? 
 I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? 
 Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? 
 You shall go easy on her . she is new here . 
 You shall just take it in surprise . 
 Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? 
 Well . if you think I can help , let me know . 

How many people are there in your family ? 
 What did you say ? How many ? 
 Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ? 
 But you don't live at home anymore . 
 My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . 
 Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent ! 
 You are so lucky ! 
 That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . 
 800 books ? I'm impressed ! 

hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? 
 your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? 
 a virtual office ? 
 what kind of services do they offer ? 
 sounds fun.what else ? 
 oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . 

How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? 
 In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? 
 Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? 
 My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting 
 To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . 
 But four boys ! 
 You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . 
 That's a great idea ! 
 That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . 
 No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . 
 No , it's not far . It's near our old house . 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Neither have I . 
 Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ? 
 I've been learning Japanese every evening . 
 I hope to visit Japan next year . 
 Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . 

Did you watch television last night , Charles ? 
 It was a good game , wasn't it ? 
 What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . 
 It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? 
 Did your wife enjoy it ? 

I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . 
 I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . 
 See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . 

Good morning , Sue . 
 I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? 
 I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ? 
 See you later , alligator . 

Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . 
 I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? 
 Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? 
 OK , next time you ’ re here . 
 I heard that you moved to Florida . 
 Tell me more . 
 Sounds great ! 
 I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . 
 I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida . 
 That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . 
 I sure will . 
 Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . 
 Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . 
 I will . Good-bye . 

can I use your laptop for a while ? 
 oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? 
 oh my , no internet access is killing me . 
 no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . 
 what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . 
 that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . 

are you a blogger ? 
 oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? 
 what do you usually write about ? 
 that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? 
 got it . Are you still updating your blog ? 
 good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . 
 can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . 
 actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . 
 yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? 
 do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? 
 do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? 
 now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information . 
 No , they have a big new fancy house . 
 Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . 
 Afraid so . The more the better . 
 Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . 
 No . They want children but no luck yet . 
 Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money . 
 Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . 
 I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . 
 She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . 
 She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . 
 why ? 
 Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . 
 no , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . 
 oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . 
 he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? 
 so what ? 

What did you think of the movie ? 
 I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . 
 I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Thanks for the sweet words . 

Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . 
 Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . 
 He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . 
 No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . 
 Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . 
 Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . 
 If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . 

I'm glad we live in a small town . 
 Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . 
 Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? 
 When can you come ? 

Did you play football yesterday ? 
 What did you do after you'd played football ? 
 Are you going swimming again this afternoon ? 
 Are you helping him all afternoon ? 
 You're , going to be very busy . 

If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . 
 What would you do ? 
 One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . 
 As I said , I'd go round the world . 
 Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . 
 Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? 
 And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . 
 What'll you have ? 
 I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . 

What are you going to do after you return from Washington ? 
 What will you do all day ? 
 Have you ever worked ? 
 I'm going to camp . I've gone to camp for four summers . 
 We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . 
 It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ? 
 Well , so long , Mary . Have fun . 

Are you going to leave school at the end of the term ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 What does a clerk do ? 
 I want to be a vet . 
 A vet-a veterinary surgeon . 
 A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor . 

who is your favorite NBA star ? 
 Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . 
 Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? 
 Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? 
 well then , what are your spoils ? 

Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ? 
 I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . 
 Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? 

Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? 
 He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish 
 School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . 
 No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . 
 My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . 
 Hi , Andy . 
 I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . 
 I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . 
 My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . 
 I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . 
 Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . 

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? 
 you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . 
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 
 and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 
 I don't know . Who ? 
 the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? 
 so you're a big fan , eh ? 
 and she was in a movie once again , right ? 
 what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? 
 did you take a photo with her ? 
 crazy ! 
 Good evening , Mary . 
 I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ? 
 I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? 
 I'll call you . 
 Have a great day , take care , bye . 
 nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . 
 okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . 
 alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . 
 it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . 
 yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . 
 cool . 
 yeah , almost . But there is one thing . 
 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... 
 some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
 yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
 i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . 
 just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 
 Oh , I'm shocked . 
 not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . 
 I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! 
 well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 
 I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . 
 yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . 

have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? 
 as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? 
 but you look quite proficient in using them now . 
 yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i 
 maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . 

I heard that ben is forming his own band . 
 can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . 
 I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . 
 I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice . 
 that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . 
 yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . 
 actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . 
 I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . 
 I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . 

what kind of music do you like listening to ? 
 yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . 
 classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . 
 yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . 
 you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . 
 that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . 
 so do i . I don ’ t like cats . 
 I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . 
 I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . 
 I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! 

are you good at making decisions ? 
 what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? 
 your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak 
 I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea . 
 you see ? You ’ re becoming more decisive already ! 
 let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . 
 you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . 
 we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . 
 that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . 
 the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . 
 I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently . 
 I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing . 
 I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . 
 Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . 

I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well . 
 now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . 
 you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? 
 they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . 
 he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . 
 really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? 
 It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? 
 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . 
 He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi 
 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . 
 They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . 
 I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! 
 It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . 
 well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . 
 I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . 
 I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 
 I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time 
 Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . 
 Is that type of plant found in this country ? 
 So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? 
 That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . 
 I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . 
 That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 
 Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . 
 More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . 
 Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . 
 A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . 

Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? 
 It seems that the climate in this country is changing . 
 I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . 
 Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . 
 There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . 
 Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . 
 The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . 
 Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . 
 Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u 
 So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . 
 Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . 
 I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon . 
 If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either . 
 The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . 
 It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
 Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . 

What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? 
 Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . 
 We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . 
 I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . 
 That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . 
 Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . 

What are the seasons like in your city ? 
 Does it ever rain in summer ? 
 What are spring and autumn like ? 
 Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine 
 No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . 

There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? 
 We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries 
 In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e 
 Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . 

What do you do in summer ? 
 I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . 
 Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . 
 Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! 
 Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! 
 I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . 
 Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . 
 Can you ride a horse ? 
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 

What's the weather like in your city ? 
 The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . 
 In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . 
 We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? 
 Have you ever had snow in your city ? 
 The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . 

Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? 
 Is it really completely flat ? 
 Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . 
 We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . 
 There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . 
 That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for 
 I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . 

Which countries have you been to ? 
 I thought you had been to Australia too . 
 I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 
 Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . 

When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . 
 Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different . 
 Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often . 
 I know . You hate the rain , don't you ? 
 And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Not always . But they like a good meal . Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food , you know . 
 I don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money . 
 To the cinema . What about coming with me ? 
 What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . 
 Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly 
 No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . 
 I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . 
 Yes , but I want to go to the country . 
 Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? 
 Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? 

Let's play chess . 
 That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . 
 You're a very good player 
 So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . 

What was the party like last night , Jean ? 
 Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . 
 I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . 
 Three every night . 
 Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . 
 The doctor said I had to be careful . 
 So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . 
 Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity . 
 That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . 
 There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . 
 If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too . 
 Thanks , how about the green and black one ? 

When was America discovered , Tony ? 
 America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 . 
 All right . Ask me a question now . 
 That's easy . It was invented by Edison . 
 I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . 
 All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ? 

It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? 
 Do you now the temperature today ? 
 How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . 
 What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . 
 That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . 
 To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks . 
 By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea . 
 Why ? Did you feel frightened ? 
 What did the pilot do ? 
 Did you land safely ? 

We've got a new manager in our department . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too 
 Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! 
 Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . 
 A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? 
 You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? 
 Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? 
 Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? 
 Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! 

I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . 

do you believe in UFO's ? 
 I've never thought about it like that before . 
 do you think that there's life on other planets ? 
 why is that ? 
 do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? 
 I suppose you're right . 
 do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? 

You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . 

I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? 
 Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! 
 Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . 

what did you do over the weekend ? 
 do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? 
 like what ? 
 what else can we do to protect the environment ? 
 how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? 
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? 
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! 

Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? 
 Would you take $ 12 ? 
 13.50 ? 

I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me . 
 You try to put on a brave face . 
 Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . 
 Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ? 
 Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . 
 Thank you all the same . 
 You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . 
 It ’ s all my faults . I forget where I put it . 
 No , but those guys like to hit on me . 
 You got me on that one . 
 Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ? 
 What a beautiful ship ! Who ’ s this ? 
 Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia . 
 Who ’ s this ? 
 It ’ s not you , is it ? 
 Why did you shave it off ? 

Hello , Ken . 
 Have you just been to the cinema ? 
 What ’ s on ? 
 Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good . 
 Yes , I have . I was there in April . 
 It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time . 

Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . 

Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? 
 I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? 
 Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? 
 Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! 
 I ’ m sure she is . 
 That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? 

Do you like this dress , madam ? 
 What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ? 
 I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop . 
 I come from England . 
 It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South . 
 I like spring and summer . The days are long and the nights are short . The sun rises early and sets late . I don't like autumn and winter . The days are short and the nights are long . The sun rises late 
 Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . 
 I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . 
 Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . 
 Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring 
 That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . 
 Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . 
 We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . 
 Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . 
 Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . 
 I come from Greece . 
 It's very pleasant . 
 It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes . 
 It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day . 
 It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes . 
 It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes . 
 I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ? 
 When did you bring it to us ? 
 Ah yes , I remember now . 
 No , they're still working on it . Let's go into the garage and have a look at it.Isn ' t that your car ? 
 Didn't you have a crash ? 
 Well , they're trying to repair it , sir . But to tell you the truth , you need a new car . 
 We may go abroad . I ’ m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ’ d like to go there , too . We can ’ t make up our minds . 
 We may travel by sea . 
 It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time . 
 Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t 
 Can you describe it , sir ? 
 Is this case yours ? 
 What about this one ? This one's got a label . 
 What's you name and address ? 
 That's right . D.N.Hall . 83.Bridge Street . Three pound and fifty pence please . 
 Thank you . 
 What ’ s the matter ? 

Has Mien sold his house yet ? 
 Has he moved to his new house yet ? 
 When ? Tomorrow morning ? 
 He's a very nice person . We will all miss him . 
 I think that they will move in the day after tomorrow . 
 Yes , I will . 
 No , he didn't want to leave , but his wife did ! 
 That's a good idea , Charlotte . 
 Just a little please . 
 No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me . That was very nice . 
 Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ? 
 I'm afraid it's empty . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 That's very good advice ! 
 Not yet , I must water the garden first . 
 I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry . 
 Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . 
 Yes , Look out of the window . 
 That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve nearly finished , June . I ’ m sure we will win something this week . 
 If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat . 
 All right . If we win a lot of money , we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels . Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country . We will have a beautiful 
 If we spend all the money , we will try and win the football pools again . 

I think my car can run much faster than yours . 
 That's true . 
 Though he's not the one who can get the highest score , yet , on the whole , he is comparable to the best . 
 I mean he's a student developing all round . 
 In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful . 
 Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . 
 Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing . 

Leo ! I wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work on the budget . We ’ re having a get-together after work tonight at Carl ’ s Karaoke Club to celebrate having finished it . We ’ d love to see 
 Oh , right . You ’ re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ? 
 Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ’ t be there . Maybe some other time ? 

Mary ! I haven ’ t seen you since our dinner with Mr . Lee last week . Where have you been hiding yourself lately ? 
 Really , nothing big . I just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and I wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department . 
 Actually , I was hoping to mix business with pleasure . Would you be interested in joining me for dinner some time this week ? I thought we might try out the new Italian restaurant everyone ’ s been 
 Is this evening too soon ? 

What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ? 
 Well , I'm afraid not . I think the hero has much more to be believed in . 
 I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . 
 Of course not.Sometimes a poor man can be extremely miserable . 
 I'm not very sure.but I know ruby is less valuable than diamond . 
 I got it from an encyclopedia . 
 In the market . Any problem ? 

Do you two know each other ? 

How you celebrate your Valentine ’ s Day with your wife ? 

May , I saw a beautiful cotton down coat in the shopping mail . 

Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon . 

Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ? 

How are you making out these days ? 

How do we spend our holiday ? Do you have any good ideas ? 

Could you please stop flipping the channels ? 

May , could you tell me how to solve this problem ? 
 Don ’ t give me your attitude . Please tell me . 
 Enough is enough . I know . 
 It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . 
 I ’ m so sorry that I have got to go . I have a business appointment right now . 
 OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will . 

When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow ! 

Darling , the airplane is going to take off . I have to go . 

This is a precious opportunity for us and our company . 

Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . 

Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ? 

May , my grandpa is ill . I will go to look after him . Catch you later ! 

Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth . 

It seems that many boys are fighting there . 

My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee . 

What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ? 

I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill . 

I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . 

I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now ! 

Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information . 

Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday . 

Although you spare no effort to complete the project . I think you have missed the boat . 

I ’ m deeply grateful for all you ’ Ve done . 

Don't worry , your baby is in my home . 

Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? 

I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time . 

I will take part in the finals soon . 

I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me . 

Thank for your help . I owe you . 

Thank you . You do me a big favor . 

I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money . 

Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it . 

You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts . 

Look over there . That is what I am looking for . Let's go ! 
 Don ’ t chicken out ! Come on ! 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 
 Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie . 
 Fair to middling . A little hard to appreciate . 
 You know , next week , we ’ ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it 
 Not bad . Everything goes well . 
 Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ? 
 It ’ s hard to say.Just so-so . 
 Yeah , I cherish it . Because I have been working like a dog for two months to buy it . 
 Just so so.There are no exciting things for me . 
 No.Why ? 
 No way ! 

We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year . 
 I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . 
 Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . 
 No , what ? 
 Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! 

Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it . 

Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight . 
 That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . 
 Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . 
 As long as I don ’ t have to row . 
 It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . 
 Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend . 

What time is our connecting flight ? 
 Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ? 
 Oh , great ! That ’ s at the other end of the terminal ! 
 I ’ m be right behind ya ! 
 I ’ m a firefighter . 
 I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . 
 I work downtown at station 24.It can get a little crazy sometimes but that ’ s what makes it challenging . 
 Yes , we do . They are all in this book . 
 No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! 

What was the biggest turing point in your life ? 
 Really ? Why is that ? 
 What would you say was the lowest point in your life ? 
 What went wrong ? 
 How long were you married ? 
 Have you remarried since then ? 
 Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ? 
 I ’ m sure you will . 
 My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . How about you ? 
 I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? 
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 
 I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . 
 No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . 

Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ? 
 you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! 
 Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off ! 
 They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . 
 It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . 
 He was actually quite handsome . What a shame . 
 It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask . 
 I was born in London , but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong . 
 I had a pretty strict up-bring , and my parents and I were always fighting about it . 
 Oh , sure . Once they reached middle age , they became a lot less uptight . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong , but I decided to go back to England , I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature . 
 I ’ m a freelance writer . i write magazine articles and fiction books 
 No , I didn ’ t . I was an english teacher for about five years , but by the time I was thirty , I decided I want a fresh challenge . 
 I started writing margin articles for fun , and eventually was asked to write a book , so I was pretty lucky . 
 Yes , it ’ s about a group of friends living in a foreign country , and all the strange experiences they have 

Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? 
 Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? 
 If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? 
 Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 

I don't know about you , but I'm famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? 
 I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan Hotpot . 
 Sure . If I could , I would eat hotpot every day ! 
 Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner ! 
 Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? 
 Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? 
 You really have a bid head , don't you ! 
 That depends . What does she look like ? 
 How tall is she ? 
 Is she chubby ? 
 It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? 
 How's her skin ? 
 Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? 
 What's the tattoo on her foot like ? 
 Even her mom ? 
 What's her personality like ? 
 So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! 
 It ’ s true . You should be happy about that . 
 That's great . What's on tonight ? 
 Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . 
 On the contrary , very exciting . 
 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . 
 It's instructive and inspiring . 
 No , it's a semimonthly . 
 Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . 

Hey , Mark , long time no see . 
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 
 They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . 
 Not much . I've go enough city life in Beijing . 
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 

Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 Great . I ’ ll have a shot . 
 Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers . 
 I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . 
 Thank you . See you . 
 Don ’ t sweat it . We will land safely . 
 Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . 
 Thank you , Lisa . 
 Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . 
 Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . 
 Please yourself . 
 Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . 
 Really ? OK , I will try my best to be relaxed . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . 
 So do I . 
 You ? You are full of hot air . 
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . 
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . 

I ’ m so hungry . Let me have a look at the menu . 

Why are you so angry , darling ? 

Cheers ! Let ’ s tie one on . 

Merry Christmas ! Let ’ s paint the town red . 

Daniel . Mind your eye ! 

You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ? 

I just have to come up for air . I ’ Ve been here for too long a time . 

Mom , I didn ’ t have breast . I could eat a horse . 

Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom ! 
 Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . 

Did you order the cake ? 
 Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . 
 Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” 

What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? 
 You have to do something romantic . 
 Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! 

what are you doing ? 
 you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? 
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! 
 well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . 
 my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . 
 not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? 
 some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? 
 how about mah-jong ? 
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! 

so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ? 
 I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ? 
 that makes sense . 
 my absolute favorite is ice hockey . 
 sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch . 
 it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . 
 not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you . 
 let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 I just stayed at home and watched TV . 
 yes , it was a very evenly matched game . 
 it ended in a tie . 
 it was three all . 
 if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . 
 their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . 
 how many more games are left this season ? 
 when do the playoffs start ? 
 of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . 
 sure , that would be great . 

Congratulations on the new house ! 
 Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . 

do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? 
 I was at home with my parents in New York City . 
 I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . 
 no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . 
 yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . 
 unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . 
 it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . 

have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? 
 apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . 
 I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . 
 you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . 
 yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . 
 I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . 
 what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . 
 no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . 
 they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . 
 I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . 
 I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . 
 yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . 
 people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
 that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . 
 being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . 
 exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
 as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . 
 what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
 I see , so it's similar to global warming ? 
 I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
 people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 

what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? 
 homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? 
 that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? 
 it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . 
 it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . 
 there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . 
 something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . 
 I can only hope that one day they will change . 
 didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
 if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . 
 he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
 they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
 I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
 I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . 

what are you watching on the telly ? 
 which one is that ? 
 I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version . 
 what are you watching now ? 
 I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . 
 have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? 
 do you watch a lot of TV then ? 
 I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ? 
 why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! 
 well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? 
 do you know anyone in the play ? 
 really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? 
 so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? 
 sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? 
 what did you do ? 
 I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . 
 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 

have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? 
 no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . 
 I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . 
 most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . 
 actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . 
 no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! 

did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? 
 well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . 
 no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . 
 religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . 
 I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . 
 I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . 
 that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . 

Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! 
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! 
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . 
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . 
 We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . 
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth . 
 Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . 
 while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . 
 the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! 
 I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . 
 all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . 
 I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . 
 you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . 
 I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . 
 who's the director ? 
 yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ? 
 that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? 
 how much does the magadize cost ? 
 that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? 
 I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! 
 what is it ? 
 yes . 
 really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ? 
 wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? 
 are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? 
 do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? 
 I'm really looking forward to reading your column . 
 sure , where would you like to go ? 

how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? 
 do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? 
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
 it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . 
 it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . 
 do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . 
 I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . 
 if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . 
 hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! 

do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? 
 sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? 
 yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 
 to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . 
 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . 
 yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? 
 It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? 
 that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? 
 great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? 

so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? 
 that's the Return of the King , right ? 
 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . 
 no . did you ? 
 yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . 
 most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . 
 I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . 

are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 it wasn't cold out this morning . 
 well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . 
 it does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 if I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 

Do you have any more questions ? 
 Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . 

Hi , Jack ! How are you doing ? 
 Same old thing.What about a drink ? 

Who's better at chess , Bill or Fred ? 
 You said it . 
 I've been away in Paris for the last two month.Glad to see you again.How are you doing ? 
 Yes , I had a wonderful time . 
 Happy to see you-too-Mike.How ' s your family ? 

Who's calling , please ? 
 What is it , John ? 

May I know who's calling ? 
 Glad to hear your voice , David . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , yes . I remember . 
 Why ? 
 I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . 
 That girl was my cousin . 
 I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . 
 I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow . 

Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina . 
 Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway . 
 Why is that ? 
 I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . 
 But they are closed today . 
 Have you already forgotten ? What's the date today ? 
 You forgot all about it , didn't you ? 
 What's that ? 
 Better not forget that , so kill you if you don't get her something . 
 Ten to nine . 
 Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ? 
 I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ? 
 You only care about your work . 
 Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ? 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah , I ’ m going to be running the Walker Avenue Branch . 
 Thanks . I appreciate it . 
 Well , Mr.Li has very good taste in wine , and Galp is one of the biggest clients . I suggest you take them to a decent French restaurant . Make sure you make a very good impression . 
 Or Lapis . They are both listed this year glory magazine for have most of frantic Fetch cuisine in town . But I heard Lapis has a better wine selection . 
 Sure . 
 I'd like to reserve a table for two , my wife and I . 
 I'm not sure . Perhaps around 8 PM . 
 Juliet , Juliet Berman . 
 Non-smoking will be fine , please . But it is more important that you get a table by the window . It's our anniversary , and I'd like to be very special . 
 Thank you , goodbye . 

How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! 

What ? What ’ s up ? 
 Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! 
 What ? What ’ s the good news ? 
 That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him ! 
 Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ? 
 That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best ! 
 Yes , Mr . Emory . Thank you . 
 We ’ re planning a June wedding , but we haven ’ t picked a date yet . 
 It ’ s going pretty well , but I ’ m really tired ! 
 It ’ s all right . I don ’ t mind being busy ! 
 Hi , could I speak to Nancy please ? 
 Yeah , it ’ s me . Can you give me a lift after work ? 
 Don ’ t tell me ! I ’ m sure it ’ s someplace warm and sunny with great beaches ! 
 You are so lucky ! Send me a postcard ! 
 Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! 
 I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 
 Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . 
 Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! 
 Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Six Soap presentation , and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I guess I ’ ll be here until ten again tonight ! 
 When did you finish ? 
 Well , I ’ m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee ! 
 No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while . 
 We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ? 
 Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ? 
 She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . 
 I think it ’ s 26th September . I ’ ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night . 
 He certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ? 
 Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? 
 Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . 
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress . 
 The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . 
 Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious . 
 The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job . 
 Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . 

How many people are in your family ? 
 I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? 
 My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 
 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . 
 About seven years now . and you ? 
 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 
 If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! 
 Of course not ! 
 Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . 
 He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . 
 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . 
 Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? 
 Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . 

Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? 
 How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? 
 Do they have any grandchildren ? 
 Does their daughter get along well with her in-laws ? 
 Do they have a large family ? 

How old is Keith ? 
 He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . 
 He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 

What's the life expectancy in your country ? 
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
 How's your son these days ? 
 He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? 
 Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . 
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour 
 It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
 what did you argue about ? 
 well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . 
 did you lend him a lot of money ? 
 well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r 
 of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? 
 I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . 
 I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . 
 if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . 
 sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . 
 maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends . 
 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 
 That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . 
 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . 
 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . 
 Of course . What do you want to move first ? 

Do you like Barry ? 
 I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . 
 What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You're right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 
 Are you taking anything ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . 
 I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! 

that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . 
 I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? 
 I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . 
 yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . 
 I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . 
 that ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks and I prepared ? 
 that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? 

so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ? 
 so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? 
 what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . 
 are the rooms nice and bright ? 
 do you have a balcony ? 
 you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? 

so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . 
 that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 
 so , what did you get them ? 
 what ’ s wrong with is ? 
 household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . 

Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
 No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . 
 So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . 
 Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting . 
 Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine . 
 yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . 
 we ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? 
 about 7:30 . 
 my name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7:30 on Friday . 
 oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good . 
 My name is Jeff . 
 I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ? 
 I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ? 
 Would you like to go out some time ? 
 Anywhere with you . 

Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
 We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . 
 That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
 So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? 
 We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . 
 Hi , Alex ! 
 I just got back from London . 
 It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . 
 It was 10 hours . 
 Yes , in paris , France . 
 Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate ? one for me and one for you ! 
 It was nothing . 
 I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? 
 Do you have a lot of homework ? 
 Of course I do ! 
 I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . 
 Yes . Are you ? 
 Do you want to study together ? 
 Do you want to go to an empty classroom ? 
 OK . Let ’ s go ! 
 Sure . Where shall I begin ? 
 I went to the university of Ohio , in America . 
 I got a bachelor ’ s degree . 
 I majored in English and minored in Chinese .

 That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ? 
 But Anne ... 
 You did spend too much , and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary . 
 No , you don't have to spend every penny you make , you could save some every month , like a lot of other people do . 
 You should save in case of an emergency , you need to have more self-control , what things did you spend money on ? 
 Let's bygones be bygones , start saving right now .

 Much better , thanks . I have been resting all day . Only with television as my companion.In fact , in the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV . 
 I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly . 
 At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials . 
 I want to watch it , but I was already tired by the time it came on . I had a rest instead , then I watched the news at Channel 11 . 
 A bank was robbed this afternoon . A reporter on the scene covered the event , the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live . 
 I learned my lesson from the last experience . I didn't arrive early enough . So I ended up with a terrible seat , All the way up in the front row . It was one of my worst movie experiences ever . 
 By the way , it was really thoughtful if you to get me the ticket . I really appreciate it , I'll buy some popcorn , and drinks for us . 
 I'll be back as soon as possible . Oh , I almost forgot I'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in .

 I'd love to . Do you often come here to dance ? 
 You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner . 
 Ok , that would be great . Do you like modern dance ? I don't care for it .

 Masha and Hero are getting divorced . 
 Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . 
 Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . 
 Early in the New Year I guess .

 Which man ? 
 Oh , he's the coach of the football team . 
 Yes . I'd like to . 

Excuse me , would you tell me who that girl is ? 
 Would you love to introduce me to her ? 

Could you introduce to me the man over there ? 
 You're so kind . 
 Well , well , Mike.Fancy meeting you here . 
 Yes , I haven't seen you for four years.How time flies ! 
 Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris . 
 Good to see you too ! 
 Haven't seen you for ages.Where have you been ? 
 In Thailand . I taught English there . 
 Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .

Excuse me , are you Jane ? 
 Oh , are you in Class Four ? 

How do you do ? 
 My name is Jane Greenwood.Glad to meet you . 

Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ? 
 Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . 
 But they're hard to be disposed of . 

George speaks Japanese better than Frank . 
 Therefore , I hope they could help each other and learn from each other . 
 Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings . 
 You can bet on that . 
 Yeah . I met him yesterday.He ' s no longer the same young man as he was eight years ago . 

You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ? 
 I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey . 

Do you like travelling ? 
 Do you usually travel by bus ? 

Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ? 
 You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen . 

Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book ! 
 I do agree with you . 
 Yeah.It ' s a must for me . 
 I won't , mum . 
 I can't . I've got to attend a meeting in London . 
 I will . 
 Take care , sonny ! 
 Bye ! 
 No , thanks . I've really got to go now . 
 You , too . 
 Good night , mum . 

Thank you very much for your invitation . 
 I'd like to say goodbye to you . 

Oh , it's ten o'clock . I'd better go now . 
 No , thanks . I'll have to meet my friend at the airport . 
 Yeah.But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's . 
 We cannot judge a man totally by that . 
 Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne . 

Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday ? 
 Really ? I got mine from her this morning . 
 You're probably right , do you intend on going to the party ? 
 I know , it does sound pretty awesome . 
 It's supposed to start at about eight . 
 I really don't know , but I don't think she gave out that many yet . 

Thanks for coming to see me today . 
 I missed you too . 
 I've been really busy . 
 Working . 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Well regardless , I'm very happy that you came to see me . 

Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up ? 
 Is that right ? I already got my invitation from her earlier . 
 Are you even going to go ? 
 Exactly , it seems like it's going to be loads of fun . 
 The invitation says it starts at 8 
 I have no idea , she hasn't given out many though . 

I'm really happy that you came to visit me . 
 I've been missing you like crazy . 
 Lately , I've been quite busy . 
 I've really been working a lot lately . 
 So what have you been up to ? 
 Whatever the reason may be , I'm glad you visited me .

 That would be me ! 
 I hope that what they had to say was mostly good !

 I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe .

 Is that all ? 
 What's an ID card ? 
 Can I board the plane now ? 
 Thank you . Now I know how to travel by air . 
 Not at all . What would you like to see first ? 
 Let's walk around the lake first , shall we ? 
 Have you been here before ? 
 I will take you to Li River after walking around here . 
 Yes , you'll be in a different world there .

 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . 
 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . 
 Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . 
 Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . 
 Yeah , many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China , I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them . 
 I heard about it , but I don't have any clothes made from silk . 
 Oh , I'm eager to have a try . 
 We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park . 
 It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing . 
 Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . 
 According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . 
 Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park . 
 What's that ? 
 Really ? It's unbelievable . 
 Do you have Ginkgo trees here ? 
 What are these trees opposite to the pine trees ? 
 I think I know that . 
 How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? 
 How ignorant I am ! 
 I know that tea . It smells fragrant . 
 Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is ! 
 At 10:30 . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Single or return ? 
 10 pounds . 
 It's platform 5 . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes . I want to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China . 
 Feynman Black . I want to leave on October 15th . 
 Well , I need an economy ticket . 
 Single . How much ? 
 OK . Here you are . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 I'd like to have Chinese food . 
 Right here , please . 
 Oh , thank you . So nice you are . 
 I want a cup of bean milk . Do you have any ? 
 Thanks a lot . Oh , excuse me . Can I take two value meals ? And I want some chili paste . 
 Oh , sorry to bother you . I want to know what kind of meat it is . 
 That's OK . Thanks very much . 
 OK . 
 Hello , I would like to make a reservation for four nights next week , from Tuesday to Friday . 
 Single room with a bath room , please . I would like a room with a view of the whole city . 
 What's the rate , please ?

 OK , that's fine . Could you hold it for me ? 

It was nice talking to you . 
 I really have to go . 
 I have things to do . 
 Don't be nosey . 
 Well , it's really none of your business . 
 I'm sorry , but I have to go . 

Oriental China Airlines . Good morning , may I help you ? 
 Lady , let me check . Do you want the morning or the afternoon flight ? 
 2:30 
 First class or economy ? 
 Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ? 
 You may take it up at the ticket office . That is located on International Street 150 . 
 OK . 
 I don't know . Maybe it's broken . 
 I'll see if I can adjust it . 
 Why not tell the clerk and ask them to repair it . 

You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend ? 
 I'm not quite sure yet . 
 What movie are you and your friend planning on watching ? 
 No good movies come to mind . 
 No , thanks . Maybe another time . 

I've enjoyed conversing with you . 
 I've got to go . 
 I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . 
 I really don't think it's any of your business . 
 I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now . 

Do you know what you're going to do this weekend ? 
 I don't know . 
 Do you know what movie you're going to watch ? 
 None that I can think of . 
 Thank you for inviting me , but I think I'll pass . 

Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd . 
 Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday . 
 I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday . 
 A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along . 
 Nine would be good , don't you think ? 

Linda , this is Todd calling . 
 Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night . 
 I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday . 
 Linda , that would be a perfect addition . 
 I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike . 

Well , it was nice talking to you . 
 We should really hang out again . 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 That sounds good . 
 I'll call you later . 
 See you later . 

I'll talk to you later . 
 I have to get off the phone now . 
 There are other things I need to take care of . 
 Please don't be nosey . 
 You don't need to worry about that . 
 I am very sorry , but I must go . 

I enjoyed talking to you . 
 We should hang out some time . 
 Is there anything you would like to do next time ? 
 I'd like that . 
 I'm going to call you soon . 
 See you soon . 

Hi Linda , this is Todd . 
 I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week . 
 I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday . 
 Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion . 
 I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad . 

John , I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year . 
 What are you talking about ? 
 You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! 
 With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . 

Joe , how are you doing ? 
 I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe . 
 I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper . 
 What were you planning on seeing ? 
 How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ? 

Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John . 
 Are you kidding me ? 
 We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . 
 Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! 

Do you enjoy going on dates ? 
 What's so fun about them ? 
 So you always have fun on dates ? 
 Why not ? 
 So then why would you ask them out in the first place ? 
 Sounds like a huge waste of time to me . 

John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . 
 You can't be serious ! 
 After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . 
 You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! 

Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? 
 Things are going well for me , Joe . 
 My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . 
 What movie did you want to see ? 
 I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” 

Hi Kara , it's Mike here . 
 I'm doing well , and you ? 
 Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ? 
 Well , we could just go out as friends . 

Hello , this is Mike , Kara . 
 Everything is fine , and how are you ? 
 Kara , I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday . 
 Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something . 

Hey Joe , how have you been ? 
 I am doing OK , Joe . 
 I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her . 
 Did you have a certain movie in mind ? 
 I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” 

What's up ? 
 I'm having a party this Friday . 
 I wanted to see if you wanted to come . 
 Doing what ? 
 I really wanted you to come , but I understand . 
 I'll hold you to that . 

What's going on ? 
 I'm throwing a party next Saturday . 
 Yeah , are you going to come ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , why don't you ? 
 Well , that's okay . 

What's going on ? 
 A lot , like the party I'm having on Friday . 
 Will you be able to make it ? 
 What do you have to do ? 
 Maybe you can come next time . 
 I'll look for you at my next party . 

Hey , what's good with you ? 
 I'm throwing a party on Friday . 
 Do you think you can come ? 
 What are you going to be doing ? 
 I was hoping you would come . 
 I'd better see you there . 

I had fun talking to you . 
 I think we should really do something sometime . 
 What do you want to do next time ? 
 Yeah , let's do that . 
 I'll call you so we can set that up . 
 All right , see you . 

What's going on with you ? 
 I'm having a party this Friday . 
 Is that right ? 
 Can you go ? 
 It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 I hope that I'll see you there . 

What's up ? 
 Next Saturday , I'm going to have a party . 
 You are coming ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Why not ? 
 I understand , I guess . 

What kind of music do you enjoy listening to ? 
 What kind ? 
 Why do you like that type of music ? 
 I think that's an excellent reason to like something . 

What type of music do you like to listen to ? 
 Like what , for instance ? 
 Why is that ? 
 That's a good reason to like something . 

What is your favorite kind of music ? 
 What genres ? 
 What interests you in that type of music ? 
 That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music . 

What's your favorite movie ? 
 Oh , why is that ? 
 That's true . It is a very funny movie . 
 Yes , I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters . 
 Me too . That movie brought tears to my eyes . 
 I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it . 

Which movie is your favorite to watch ? 
 Is that right ? Why ? 
 You're right . That movie is hilarious . 
 I went to see it the day it came out . 
 I couldn't help laughing , either . 
 I bought the movie . Would you like to come to my house and watch it ? 

Out of every movie that you've seen , which one is your favorite ? 
 You think so , how come ? 
 You're not lying , I found that movie absolutely hilarious . 
 I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out . 
 I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards . 
 I got the movie when it came out on DVD , do you want to come over ? 

What kinds of things do you like to do ? 
 I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint . 
 How long have you known how to do that ? 
 Did you take some sort of art class or something ? 
 You have got to be talented . 
 If only I was talented . 

Are there any hobbies you do ? 
 Oh , you actually do that ? 
 Did you always know how to draw and paint ? 
 You had an art class ? 
 Well , it's good that you're so talented . 
 Talent is a great thing , I wish I had one . 

Tell me , what do you enjoy doing in your spare time ? 
 You know how to draw and paint ? 
 When did you learn how to do that ? 
 Oh , so you took an art class ? 
 I see that you're pretty talented . 
 I wish I had a talent like that . 

I really want to go to the beach this weekend . 
 I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend . 
 I believe so . 
 I know . I really want to go to the beach . 
 You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold . 
 I do too . That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time . 

I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . 
 The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . 
 It sounds like it will be . 
 That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . 
 That is true . The weather is constantly changing . 
 That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . 

How's it going ? 
 Never better , thanks . 
 I've actually been pretty good . You ? 
 Which school do you attend ? 
 Are you enjoying it there ? 
 Good luck with that . 

Why weren't you at school yesterday ? 
 What was wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel better now ? 
 Do you want anything to make you feel better ? 
 I hope you feel better . 

Hi , how are you doing ? 
 I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . 
 I've been great . What about you ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 Do you like it there ? 
 Good luck with school . 

To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 707 to New York City ? 
 Show me the fastest way to get there . 
 Do you think the plane will leave without me ? 
 Thank you so much , I would really appreciate that . 

How are you doing today ? 
 I'm absolutely lovely , thank you . 
 I haven't been better . How about yourself ? 
 Where are you going to school ? 
 How do you like it so far ? 
 I wish you luck . 

What reason do you have for missing school ? 
 How were you sick ? 
 Did it get any better ? 
 Would you like anything for your stomach ? 
 Get better . 

It's my first time to come to Bangkok . Could you recommend some places for me ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Sounds persuasive . How much will you charge for it ? 
 That's reasonable . Will you take care of meals for the day ? 
 I see . May I know the schedule ? 

Hi , Helen . Where are you going on this summer vacation ? 
 That sounds like fun ! 
 There are many famous resorts in Egypt . You can have a good time here . 
 I'm afraid two days isn't enough for you to see all the places of interest . 
 If I were you , the pyramid would be my first choice . It's so magnificent . 
 You needn't worry about it . There are many stores at the scenic spots . I'm sure you can get what you want . 

Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . I am sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Hong Kong the next day . 
 A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon . 
 At 10:20 
 All right , sir . Please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 noon two days before the flight ; otherwise , your reservation will automatically be canceled . 
 It's 500 dollars , not including ground transportation fares between the airport and downtown . 
 Right , sir . And please do not forget to bring a valid travel document with you when you buy the tickets . 

Good evening . Welcome to Mansion Hotel . 
 Last name , Rodgers ? 
 Very well . Welcome , Mr . Rodgers . Would you please fill out the registration card ? How are you doing today ? 
 Mr . Rodgers , how would you handle your account ? 
 I will check to see if there any messages for you ? Well , here is one message for you . 
 Certainly , I can take care of that for you . What time would you like the wake-up call ? 
 Mr . Rodgers , this is George . He will take care of your luggage and show you to your room . If there is anything I can do for you , please let me know . 
 Have a pleasant stay . 
 Good . 
 That's excellent , thanks for all your help . 
 For 3 days $ 300 , for 7 days $ 600 . 
 Okay . I'll write up the paperwork . 
 No , I couldn't make it . 
 Oh , really ? Who won ? 
 Too bad I was busy . I really wanted to go . 
 So what was the score ? 
 Man , that was a really close game . 
 I'll make sure and make it to the next one . 
 I was unable to make it . 
 Is that right . Who ended up winning ? 
 I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go . 
 What was the score at the end of the game ? 
 Sounds like it was a close game . 
 The next game , I will definitely be there . 
 I wanted to go , but I couldn't . 
 It's too bad that I couldn't make it . Who won ? 
 I really wish I went to the game . 
 So tell me the final score . 
 It must've been a close game . 
 Hopefully , I'll make it to the next one . 
 What's the weather going to be like ? I may want to go too . 
 Will it be good beach weather ? 
 It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend . 
 This California weather is so uncertain , it's impossible to know what'll happen . 
 I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable . 
 I know . Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like . 
 I know . I think it may rain . 
 That would be weird . 
 I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . 
 I really wish it wasn't so hot every day . 
 I like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold . 
 Me too . 
 This is she . How's it going ? 
 Sorry about that . I was cleaning up . 
 So what were you calling me about ? 
 Sure , what did you want to do ? 
 That sounds like fun . Let's do it . 
 See you then . Goodbye . 
 Speaking . What's up ? 
 My bad , I had chores to do . 
 What was the reason for your call ? 
 Sounds good . What did you have in mind ? 
 Okay , let's go see a movie . 
 Talk to you later . 
 You're talking to her . 
 I was busy doing something . I apologize . 
 Did you need something ? 
 Is there somewhere special you wanted to go ? 
 A movie sounds good . 
 I will see you tomorrow . 
 You're right . I think it's going to rain later . 
 That wouldn't seem right . 
 Exactly , it wouldn't be nice if it started raining . It's too hot . 
 I wish it would cool off one day . 
 I enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes . 
 That's exactly how I feel . 
 I attended school today . Did you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ? 
 It's no trouble at all . 
 Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better . 
 That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . 
 It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . 
 Any rain right now would be pointless . 
 I want it to cool down some . 
 Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . 
 I feel the same way . 
 That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . 
 It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . 
 Any rain right now would be pointless . 
 I want it to cool down some . 
 Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . 
 I feel the same way . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Did you really ? 
 Well , congratulations . 
 I'm so happy for you . 
 Yes . You really deserved this . 
 Yes . Good for you . 
 I haven't heard anything . 
 Are you serious ? 
 That's great . Congratulations . 
 You have no idea how happy I am for you . 
 I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do . 
 I went to school today . Did you go to school ? 
 That's horrible . I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class . 
 Don't mention it . 
 That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow . 
 You haven't told me anything yet . 
 Is that right ? 
 Congratulations on your promotion . 
 I am really excited for you . 
 I'm serious . You deserved this promotion . 
 Yes , I do . 
 What happened ? 
 She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ? 
 No , I had no idea . 
 Oh my God , that's great ! 
 I think that I might . 
 Thanks for telling me . 
 I haven't heard anything . 
 Nobody told me . 
 I really wasn't told anything . 
 Wow , how exciting . 
 Of course I will . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Heard what ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 I honestly didn't know . 
 That's good to hear . 
 Of course I will . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it . 
 I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me . 
 That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish . 
 Yes , do you like it ? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables . 
 Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal . 
 My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ? 
 It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . 
 How are your vegetables ? 
 Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . 
 I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food . 
 It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ? 
 I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . 
 Are your vegetables OK ? 
 So are mine . I think they left them cooking too long . 
 I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something . 
 Thank you . I am glad that everything turned out so well . 
 I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute . 
 Isn't that great ? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice . 
 Yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . 
 I appreciate you bringing the wine . It goes well with the chicken . 
 Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . 
 I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . 
 I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . 
 Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . 
 I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken . 
 No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
 The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? 
 Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . 
 How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
 I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . 
 $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . 
 No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? 
 Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? 
 Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . 
 How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? 
 I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . 
 I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . 
 The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ? 
 It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . 
 Are your vegetables a little mushy ? 
 Mine aren't so good , either . 
 I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem . 
 Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day . 
 I got it from Macy's . 
 Thanks again . You look nice today , too . 
 Really ? What kind of shoes are they ? 
 I really like those . How much did they cost ? 
 I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair . 
 No . Have you ? 
 What does she look like ? 
 How tall would you say that she is ? 
 What about her facial features ? 
 I think I know who you're talking about . 
 I think that I have . 
 No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . 
 I think that is our waitress is over by the bar . Boy , the service has not been good this evening . 
 Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together . 
 What do you think would be the right amount to tip ? 
 I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . 
 I think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Describe her to me . 
 Well , how tall is she ? 
 What does she look like , though ? 
 I may know which girl you're talking about . 
 Yes , I have . 
 You do ? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago . 
 I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall . 
 Thanks . I think you look nice today , too . 
 Those are nice . What are they ? 
 Those are great . How much were they ? 
 I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks . 
 Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit . 
 I went to Macy's and picked it out . 
 Well , I think you look nice today too . 
 I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ? 
 Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ? 
 I'm going to go get a pair for myself . 
 I haven't seen her yet . 
 Tell me how she looks . 
 What height is she ? 
 That's nice , but tell me what she looks like . 
 I think I might've bumped into her before . 
 I believe so . 
 Of course . Did you ? 
 That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ? 
 I'm serious , have you ? 
 I really want to go to the movies this weekend . 
 I really don't want to go by myself . 
 No , I think I'm going to go to the movies . 
 I always do . Did you go to school today ? 
 You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? 
 Maybe it was , but answer the question . 
 I want to go to see a movie this weekend . 
 I don't want to go alone . 
 No , I want to go to the movies instead . 
 Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . 
 Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . 
 I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun . 
 What time does the party start ? 
 Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? 
 Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today . 
 Yeah , I went . Did you go ? 
 That's nice , have you been to the movies lately ? 
 It may have been random , but have you ? 
 I would love to catch a movie this weekend . 
 I don't want to see a movie by myself . 
 I think I might just go to the movies . 
 Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? 
 Sure . Meet me at five . 
 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . 
 Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . 
 Sure , I ’ m heading out myself . Enjoy your evening . 
 Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! 
 No , I haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ? 
 You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did . 
 I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here . 
 Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? 
 Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager . 
 No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . 
 No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
 This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? 
 OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . 
 Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? 
 Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . 
 I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . 
 No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . 
 I have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional . 
 Let's take a look at our bill . The total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 . 
 I know that 15 % is a normal tip , but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . What do you think about tipping her 20 % ? 
 So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 . 
 It absolutely was a great meal . We'll have to return here for lunch sometime . 
 Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ? 
 I ’ m free all afternoon . Why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ? 
 I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ? 
 Yeah , why not ? I ’ Ve got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 
 Hi . John , it ’ s Emily . How ’ s everything ? 
 Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ? 
 No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? 
 The service here has been really great , don't you think ? 
 So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . 
 Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . 
 OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . 
 We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon . 
 Thanks . You know , I just noticed that these eggs are fried , and I ordered scrambled . 
 Not a problem . I can just trade my plate with his . 
 Pancakes ? I don't like pancakes . I ordered waffles . 
 I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles . 
 That would take care of it , thank you . 
 Hi , could you help me ? I need to make a dinner reservation . 
 Tuesday night is when we need the reservation for . 
 7 
 We need a reservation for four . 
 My last name is Foster . Thank you for the reservation . 
 We will be there ! Thanks for the help ! 
 We have a dinner reservation for four at 7:00 under the name of Foster . 
 Thank you . Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting ? 
 I would really prefer an outside table . Would that be possible ? 
 Sure , that would be great ! Thank you ! 
 Yes , I would like a vodka gimlet , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thanks so much . Miss , I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled , and these are fried . 
 Oh yeah . Here , I will just trade with him . 
 But I ordered waffles ! 
 That's OK . I will eat my eggs and bacon , and you can take my pancakes back . 
 Thank you so much ! 
 Yes , I have . 
 No problem . I can do that for you . 
 I know . What time do they go ? 
 Okay , I won't forget . 
 Oh , good ! You know , I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs , not fried . 
 I can just trade with him , thank you . 
 I am sorry , but I think I ordered waffles . 
 Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles . While I am waiting , I will eat my bacon and eggs . 
 I would appreciate that . 
 Hi , I would like to make a dinner reservation . 
 We will need the reservation for Tuesday night . 
 We would prefer 7 
 There will be 4 of us . 
 Thank you . The last name is Foster . 
 Thank you so much . I appreciate your help . 
 Hello , I need to make a dinner reservation . 
 We will be coming to your restaurant on Tuesday night . 
 Our first choice would be 7 
 Four of us will be coming . 
 Great ! Our last name is Foster . 
 I look forward to having dinner at your restaurant . Thank you for your help . 
 I fed them earlier today . 
 Okay , I'll do that later . 
 I know . What time is their appointment ? 
 I got it . I will remember . 
 I am Mr . Foster , and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people . 
 We are going to have a drink while we are waiting . Please let the hostess know that she can find us there . 
 Those patio tables are new , aren't they ? Would it be possible to be seated out there ? 
 We would love to sit outside . Thanks for your help ! 
 Yes , could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order ? 
 We'll be ready to order by the time you get back ! 
 Our reservation is under the name of Foster at 7:00 for four people . 
 We would like to begin with a cocktail while we are waiting . Would you tell the hostess to please come and let us know when our table is ready ? 
 The patio tables look really nice . Could we be seated there , please ? 
 Thanks ! We'll sit out there then . We will just order our drinks out there . 
 Yes , why don't you bring us a bottle of the house Chablis with four glasses to start with ? 
 We appreciate your help . 
 Of course . I fed them today . 
 Sure , I'll give them a bath . 
 I remember . What time do they need to be there ? 
 All right . I'll make sure and remember . 
 I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Yeah , I got home around two . 
 I am not sure . I don't know that many restaurants around here . 
 Good . Let's take a look ! 
 I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best . 
 Oh yes , I've heard of that one . Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great ! 
 I think that that would be a really good choice ! Let's call and make a reservation . 
 I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . 
 I was in New York for a wedding . 
 Thanks . Try not to work too hard while I ’ m away ! 
 Okay-bye ! Have a nice Christmas . 
 I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant . 
 OK , we could look at that . 
 I really like Japanese or Thai food . 
 Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it ! 
 That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ? 
 It ’ s hard to believer you ’ re really retiring . What are you going to do with yourself ? 
 Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are . 
 Hi , Susan . How are you feeling today ? 
 Glad to hear it . 
 I didn't really like it all that much . 
 Well , they are pretty new . I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet . 
 The food wasn't all that exciting . 
 Yes , the service certainly didn't add to the experience . 
 Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down . 
 I really liked it ! 
 What did you enjoy the most ? 
 The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert . 
 I really felt that the service was exceptionally good . 
 I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant . 
 Actually , it could have been better . 
 It is a new restaurant . I don't think they have their act together yet . 
 I felt that the food was pretty mediocre . 
 I agree . The service was not good . 
 No , I think that I've had enough of this restaurant . 
 Let me try . It has to be somewhere amazing , and far away ... Egypt ? 
 Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store . 
 I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours . 
 We'll get to go fishing at the river . I hate fish . 
 You want to make sure it's good solid habit before anything else takes its place , like work ? 
 And where are we going to go ? 
 Are we going all out or just starting with a mini family vacation ? 
 Well , I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all . Take a look at this ! 
 Yes , I would like to make a reservation for May 3rd . 
 Only one .

 What is the temperature today , do you know ?

 That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ? 
 Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ? 
 I see . OK . 
 In cash , please . Here you are . 
 By the way , please forward my mail to this address . 

Hi , I'm here to check in . 
 Thank you ... Excuse me , sir . You forgot to fill in your visa number . 

Hurry up , guys ! The train is about to leave . 

I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much . 
 I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ? 
 ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . 
 What do you think of the leading actors ? 
 You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . 
 It ’ s quiet and clean . I love the color scheme . 
 I really like it here . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to book a single room with a bath from the afternoon of October 4th to the morning of October 10th . 
 Yes , it is Smith . 
 Yeah . You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes . 
 I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable . 
 You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ? 
 I guess it is . The restaurant is on the second floor . Please enjoy your dinner , sir ! 
 My pleasure . How do you want me to do it ? 
 Ready ? Say cheese . 
 Do you have any postcards ? 
 Can I have one each ? 
 Is there anywhere I can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery ? 
 Are their cards free , too ? 

Hello , who is speaking , please ? 
 Oh , good . Let me get a pencil and take down the information . Well , go ahead , please . 
 What time does it leave ? 
 That is good . 
 That's right . 
 Those are in the non-smoking section , aren't they ? 
 Fine , thank you very much . 
 Sure . They are my kids , Alex and Kathy Stern . 
 Thanks . 
 For color prints ? 
 About three days . 
 Here's your receipt . 
 Is she coming ? 
 They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . 
 I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? 
 Name it and I'll do it for you . 
 I've got it . 
 I am just doing what I think I should do . 
 This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business 

Good morning , sir ! Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . We have many trains going to Beijing , fast train , through train , express train and tourist train . Which train do you prefer ? 
 Then you'll have two choices . Train No . 14 leaves at 6:00 p . m , and train No . 22 leaves at 8: 00 p . m . 
 They will arrive the next morning , at 8: 00 a . m . and 10:00 a m . respectively . 
 Right . Trains No . 13 and No . 14 are the best trains on the line between Beijing and Shanghai . Which seats do you prefer , cushioned seats , ordinary seats , cushioned berth , or ordinary berth ? 

I'd like to check out . 
 No . I'd like to do that now . 

May I show you to your room ? 
 Here , let me help you with your bags . 

Let's go over this plan again . 
 And that is mostly flat , right ? 
 And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? 
 It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . 

I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? 
 You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? 
 Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . 
 How many people are on the waiting list right now ? 

Where can I park my car ? 
 Okay . Here you are . 

How many people are traveling with you today , miss ? 
 And how many bags do you have ? 
 You must be going to some island to relax in the sun where all you need is a swim suit and a toothbrush . 
 Well , you have fun . 

OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people . 
 That's true . And this trip has been a very productive one for us . 
 Believe me , Mr . Wang . I'll do my best to promote the transaction . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . 
 I think we will have opportunities to meet each other in the future . 
 Fine . Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 

Can I help you ? 
 I am sorry . We are full up for tomorrow . 
 Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them . 

I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow . 
 Well , how about the 4th ? 
 Yes . Please help me reserve it . 
 Sure . Just a minute . Let me take my camera out . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I hope not ! Oh , I see . 
 The batteries are worn down . I need replace them . 
 All photography shops carry them . 

Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ? 
 I'd like a suite . What's the rate ? 

Excuse me , do you have a vacancy ? 
 Well , I would like to book a single room . 
 5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 . 
 Yes , what kind of room do you want ? 
 Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . 

Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ? 
 Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . 
 Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . 
 I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . 
 Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir . 
 Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . 
 Could be . 
 ( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh , excuse me , where is the Lost and Found ? 
 Thank you , thank you , thanks again . 
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 
 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? 
 How much again ? 
 That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . 
 DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml . 
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? 
 OK , I'll take one . 
 I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . 
 No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . 
 Oh , yeah , the brand name . 
 Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . 
 Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . 
 Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible .

 Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible . 
 Where else haven't I been to yet ? 
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ? 
 Private collectors ! Oh , they must have excellent collections . I'll go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , David , don't keep me in suspense ! 
 Enough , David ! I can't wait anymore . Let's go right now ! 
 Very interesting . That's really a place I must go and see . And then ? 
 Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say . 
 Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . 
 Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . 
 Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . 
 Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . 
 I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . 
 No , this is the second time . 
 Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . 
 What should I do about it ? 
 OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . 
 Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . 
 I am not used to wearing that . Thanks . 
 Thank you so much . 

Where do you want to go this weekend ? 
 Do you want to take the jet ski ? 
 Oh , that's right . Renting is good ! 
 Okay , you call them . 

Excuse me , is this the Guyon Travel Agency ? 
 I want to travel to the ancient town in the south of China . Would you please tell me something about it ? 
 Wonderful . That's just what I expect , where is my first place if I go there ? 
 How long does the tour take ? 
 what's the cost ? 
 I know . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . 

What a wonderful sight ! 
 We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place . 
 So would I . Look , it might be going to rain . 
 It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Yes . Steven Smith , room 609 . 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 Here you are . 
 OK . Is it possible to leave my luggage here until I'm ready to leave this afternoon ? I'd like to say goodbye to some of my friends . 
 Just three . I'll be back at 3:00 p . m . 
 Thank you . See you later . 
 Sorry , sir , in order to protect these paintings , taking photos are strictly forbidden here . 
 I am really sorry for that . 
 Is This where I pay the airport tax ? 
 I'm sorry , but I've never done this before . How many what ? 
 My wife and me . The two of us . 
 Oh , OK . Here's 200 yuan . 
 Thanks . What shall I do then ? 
 Oh , I guess I'm a little confused . 
 Thanks a lot .

 Why not travel by ourselves ? 
 I want to have a two-day trip around the city . 
 It's interesting . I think I will take the bus tour . By the way , what about the lodging ? 

Steward ! 
 May I have a magazine or something ? 
 One in English , please . 

What would you like for dessert , sir ? We have a choice of cake or ice cream . 
 oh , well , perhaps you'd like a cup of coffee or tea instead . 

Dutton Hotels . How may I help you today ? 
 Certainly , I can help you with that . Will that be the downtown or waterfront location ? 
 What date do you plan to check in ? 
 Okay , let me see what we have . For how many ?

 I'm going to New York . 
 In Chicago .

Is the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 OK . Is the plane on schedule ? 
 Two . 
 It's about twelve hours .

 And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time . 
 Yes , here is your reservation . You have a standard room reserved for two nights . Is that right ? 
 Oh , my mistake . The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed . I'm sorry for the error .

 Well , the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key . 
 Yes . I locked myself out . May I borrow a duplicate key for Room 201 ? 
 I'm right outside my room . 

I just called Mr . Smith in Room 201 , but there was no reply . Would you find out if he's still staying there ?

 Yes , it is . 

Excuse me , may I help you ? 
 Sure , Please wait a moment . 
 No problem . 
 What a beautiful view we have here . 
 Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ? 

Hi , I'm Josephine Chen , the tour guide for the Jade Agency . We have a reservation of twenty rooms for tonight . 
 No , our check-out time will still be 8: 30 tomorrow . 
 That's alright . 
 Thank you . 

Excuse me , how many sightseeing spots are there in the park ? 
 Do I have to buy extra ticket if I want to visit the main spots ? 
 Well , do you have through tickets ? 

Excuse me . Where is the way out ? 
 It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? 
 It should be the way out .

 The museum doesn't open today . 
 Where shall we go now ? 

Here is your ticket . Let's get in the museum .

 Well , there does have one . Walk along the road and turn left when you come to a bystreet . It will lead you to the back gate of the park . 
 I don't think so . 
 I have just got lost with my friends . Would you please help me find them ? 
 Shone . And one of my friends ' name is Jessie . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . We promised that . 
 Really ? I am sorry , sir . We will look into this matter . Would you please wait a moment here ? 
 Yes . I have my wallet stolen . 
 I don't know the exact time . Maybe I lost it last night when I was traveling on the bus . 
 It's a black leather one.There are my credit card and ID and some money . 
 It's really spectacular . 
 I think we can climb to the top , can't we ? 

Where are we going to visit today ? 
 Really ? I have heard there are many famous national park in the US , which one exactly ? 
 That's wonderful . I will see the Old Faithful for myself . 
 I'd be glad to have your help . Could you make the air-conditioner cooler ? 
 Good idea .

 Orange juice , please .

The May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? 
 Where are you planning on going ? 
 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . 
 Personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . 
 It ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 
 Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . 
 Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number .

 Poor boy ! But don't worry . Here are two pills made in Germany . It's really effective . He will be just fine . 
 Take some with you next time , just in case . 
 You mean the boy who felt carsick just now ? 
 Oh , sorry , maybe I gave you the wrong medicine . 
 It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good . But don't worry . It has no undesirable side-effects . 

Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? 
 That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? 
 How many days is the tour ? 
 That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . 
 I'm sorry , but everything is taken . 
 Yes , I can give you a reservation on that . 
 Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor . 
 People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough . 
 Yes , I'm calling from Mexico . I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability . 
 Yes , July ninth . I will be there for seven nights . 
 What's the difference ? 
 OK , I would like to reserve the superior suite . Is breakfast included ? 
 Sure , my credit card number is ... 
 You can be sure of that , sir .

Good afternoon , passport and arrival card please . 
 Where are you coming from ? 
 Is this your country of birth or residence . 
 What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ? 
 How long do you plan to stay in the United States ? 
 Sir , you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying . 
 You must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time . 
 Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here ? 
 Very good . Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Very well sir , welcome to the United States , enjoy your visit . 
 I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife . 
 I think something in the countryside would be nice . 
 Sounds good ! What is the hotel that we will be staying at like ? 
 Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? 
 I ’ m sold ! I want to book this trip . I don ’ t care what it costs ! Money is no object ! 
 Yes , it's $ 167 . 

Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
 Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly . The water doesn ’ t run in the shower . 
 That ’ s not bad . Thanks for your help . 

Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities . 
 Do they have a swimming pool ? 
 What ’ s the service like ? 
 It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? 
 I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . 
 Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? 
 One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . 

This is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . 
 It ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about ten kilometers . 
 Right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . 
 We can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . 
 Yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . 
 That ’ s right . 
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . 
 Yes , there are . They tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk . 
 Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . 
 The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . 
 I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . 
 I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . 
 That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . 
 Good morning . I ’ d like to book a room for Friday night and Saturday night . 
 A single room please . I hope you ’ re not fully booked . 
 Jones . According to your website , the nightly rate is $ 50 , including breakfast . 
 Thank you very much . I look forward to seeing you on Friday . 
 That ’ s fine . My credit card number is ... 
 Yes , here you go . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . 
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! 
 Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . 
 That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
 It ’ s a difficult choice . The train is a litter faster , but much more expensive . 
 Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . 
 Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
 I prefer going by train , ever though it costs more . 
 The train aren ’ t usually full . We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles . 

So , are we all ready to go ? 
 Did you get the camera ? 
 Yup , it ’ s all set . 
 I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . 
 Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ? 
 I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . 
 That would be nice . How are you getting there ? 
 Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... 
 Which is more expensive ? 
 Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? 
 Here you are . 
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself . 
 Well , then , how much do I owe you ? 

Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please . 
 What for ? 
 Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right . 
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . 
 Thank you . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ? 
 NO.You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . 

Good morning . 
 Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished.You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say.It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . 
 It's very considerate of you to do so.Do you have any laundry today ? 
 Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . 
 Yes.When is the next train to New York City ? 
 Aren't there any trains before ten thirty ? 
 Then one to New York at ten thirty . 
 One way . 
 How much is a soft ? 
 Then one hard seat , please . 

Good evening . 
 Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one . 
 This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room . 
 It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you ? 
 Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ? 
 Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon . 
 Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us . 
 ten fifteen a . m . 
 Sorry.You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . 

Have you anything to declare ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Do you travel a lot ? 
 Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? 
 I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ? 
 Yes , I'd like to see the receipt.Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . 
 Yes , I'm afraid you will.Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds . 
 Yes , that's fine . I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston ? 

Passport , please , madam . 
 Thank you.Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form . 
 No , only the articles listed on the Declaration . 
 Here you are . 
 Ok.But is there anything wrong ? 
 I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . 
 Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ? 
 I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation . 
 Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks . 
 Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare . 
 All right . 
 Yes , it does . 
 I think it leaves at two thirty . 
 Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . 
 Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . 
 Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . 
 Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . 
 Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . 
 Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . 
 Exactly . Here is the Nine-dragon Screen . 
 Sure , this will be a really good picture . 
 George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . 
 Where will we sleep , then ? 
 What about other expenses ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? 
 Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . 
 Let ’ s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! 
 Sure , here you are . And here are my application forms as well . 
 Nice to meet you Mr . Jones . 
 Well , my first order of business will be attending a conference in Seattle , but after that I intend to spend two weeks visiting my friends . I assumed a business visa would be required . 
 So I can attend conferences and do business on that visa ? 
 Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time . 
 Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ? 
 Airport security.Could you empty your pockets over here , please ? 
 Ah , a set of keys . 
 That's all right.Enjoy your flight . 

May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ? 
 Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? 
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight.You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . 
 That comes to H . K . $ 120 . 
 Please I'd like a ticket to New York . 
 No , early saturday morning . 
 Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty . 
 No , exactly not 
 Sounds not good . I won't take it . 
 No , I haven't . I've decided I ' m going to travel very light this time . 
 Oh ! It means that I'm going to take only a few clothes , so I didn't have to carry a heavy suitcase . 
 No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . 
 You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . 
 Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . 
 That would be nice.How are you getting there ? 
 Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...

 Now.Have you ever thought of going by express bus ?

 Great , let's go ! 
 Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... 
 Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . 
 Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? 
 Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . 

Finally we're on board ! 
 Are they window seats or aisle seats ?

 Thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 
 Good idea . 
 Ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . 
 And no hijackers .

 Perfect . I'II start preparing tomorrow . If we re going to drive , l'II need to fill up the tank . 
 We can take the train , that will be faster . I'II book the tickets tomorrow morning . 
 No problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . 

Hello , Sara are you finished packing yet ? Do you need a hand ? 
 Make sure you have your ID card . You will need it while you travel . 
 All your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer . 
 Sara ? 
 Did you buy a map ? Traveling can be really inconvenient without one , and you could even wind up lost 
 Also , take these pills in case you have any airsickness , and take some cold medicine , too . How about some band-aids ? 
 Take care , dear ! Be careful ! Oh Sara , wait a minute ! You forget your raincoat and umbrella .

 Late in the afternoon , after work .

 Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip ! 
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed.we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . 
 Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ? 
 You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? 
 Well.let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! 
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . 

Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . 
 Why ? 
 You got lost . You're kidding ! 
 You could have called . 
 You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 
 I don't know . Where ? 
 Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? 
 Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
 Hmm , maybe I do . 
 Maybe I have an idea how it happened . 
 You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . 
 Yes , that's what I think.Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries , you'll get lost for even longer.Maybe six hours or so . 
 What ? 
 Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . 

What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Yes , I see . five thirty AM Mr . Green , Room 1021 . 
 Ok , could you tell me your room number and your name ? 
 And when would you want us call you this time ? 
 Ok , six thirty AM . We will call you exactly on that time . 
 We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic . 
 Yes , but don't worry . We'll make it . 
 In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . 
 Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone . 
 No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 
 That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . 
 Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . 
 Hmm . Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night . 
 Well , as they say , garbage in , garbage out . Let me correct this error , please . 
 When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge . 
 Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 . 
 Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not . 
 Of course ! How much would you like to spend on your meal ? 
 Well , how about our own hotel restaurant ? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating . 
 Well , how about Gramercy Tavern ? It's a very popular tourist spot , with great food and music . 
 Of course , sir . You've made a good choice . 
 Certainly ! How much are you planning to spend on dinner , sir ? 
 May I suggest our own hotel restaurant ? It got three stars in the latest restaurant review . 
 There's always Gramercy Tavern . They have live jazz . The food is delicious , but very expensive . 
 As you wish , sir . You'll have a wonderful time there . 
 Of course . What would you like ? 
 I'm so sorry . We ran out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay . 
 Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready . Enjoy ! 
 No problem . Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you're good to go . 
 Hmm . Well , we have some alternatives , if you're interested . 
 We have a computer lab on the first floor . 
 It's absolutely free to guests . Except for printing , of course . 
 You could use your wireless right here in our lobby . 
 Well , we don't have a printer in the lobby yet . You'll have to use the lab . 
 Sure . What do you fancy ? 
 Sir , the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out . May I suggest the porterhouse ? 
 Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ? 
 Your food will be brought to you momentarily . I hope you enjoy it . 
 Just name it , sir . 
 Regrettably , we're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay , no strawberries tonight . The items will be charged to your amenities account . 
 Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible . 
 There's an Ethernet cable in your room . Just plug it into the back of your laptop . 
 That's okay . I can tell you about some alternatives we have . 
 Well , there's our computer lab on the first floor . 
 The lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print . 
 Of course . Our lobby is set up for wireless , so just bring your computer down here . 
 They plan to install a printer here . But until then , you'll have to use the lab . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running . 
 In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives . 
 For starters , we have a computer lab . 
 The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing . 
 Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here . 
 Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs . 
 Tell me what you're hungry for . 
 Unfortunately , we're out of filet mignon at the moment . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 You'll see this charge on your amenities account . 
 It won't be long until your food is delivered . I know you'll enjoy it . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be online in a heartbeat . 
 No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives . 
 Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor . 
 Sir , the computers are free to guests , but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee . 
 Just use your computer here in the lobby . It's set up for wireless . 
 We might have a printer here next month . But for now , you'll have to go to the lab . 
 What would you like ? 
 I'm sorry . We're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay , no strawberries . Room service will be charged to your amenities account . Is that all right ? 
 It will be up shortly . Enjoy your food , sir . 
 We have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor . 
 The price per copy is ten cents . 
 There shouldn't be any long lines , sir . 
 Just tell me what you'd like , please . 
 I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne ? 
 That'll be a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and porterhouse , all charged to your amenities account . 
 Please call if you have any other requests . Your food will be delivered promptly . 
 Could you be a little more specific , sir ? 
 I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ? 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 You want some souvenirs ! 
 But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items . 
 I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly . 
 By amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ? 
 Okay , I got it . You've already run out of all your amenities ? 
 I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? 
 Okay , finally I understand . You would like souvenirs ! 
 If it's souvenirs you want , sir , just visit our souvenir shop . It has everything . 
 No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit . 
 I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . 
 Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . 
 Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? 
 Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! 
 Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount . 
 I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . 
 Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir . 
 Sir , one copy is ten cents . 
 You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir . 
 I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . 
 Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? 
 I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs ! 
 Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items . 
 Sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily . 
 Amenities ? What do you mean by amenities , sir ? 
 I see . Sir , if I may ask . Have you used up all the amenities in your room ? 
 Then what is the problem , sir ? 
 Souvenirs ? 
 We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor , sir . 
 I'll call housekeeping . Someone will be up with more amenities shortly . 
 There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab , sir . 
 It's ten cents a copy , sir . 
 A dime is still a bargain , sir . 
 Sir , you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab . 
 Sir , each copy is ten cents or one dime , whichever you prefer . 
 Those were the good old days , sir , indeed . 
 One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are . 
 May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ? 
 Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time . 
 Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go ! 
 If you don't mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel ? 
 That's very honest of you . Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time . 
 Give me just a few seconds , sir , and I'll hand you your receipt . Here you are . 
 I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir . 
 I apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . I hope you have a nice trip home . 
 No problem , sir . There's a copy machine in our computer lab . 
 Each copy will cost you a dime , sir . 
 There aren't many things you can get for a nickel , sir . 
 Thank you for that , and in return , here's your receipt . 
 I hope you'll visit us again , sir . 
 I guarantee you that our little “ friends ” won't be back . I hope your trip home is pleasant . 
 Just one second , sir , and I'll give you your receipt . Here you go . 
 Sir , did you enjoy your stay here ? 
 I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us . 
 Thank you . And here's your receipt , sir . 
 I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . 
 I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit . Please have a pleasant trip home . 
 Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' 
 Okay , let me see what I can do for you . 
 I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service . 
 Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . 
 Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening . 
 Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please . 
 Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill . 
 Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer . 
 If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way . 
 But of course ! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner ? 
 In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . 
 You can always go to Gramercy Tavern . It's quite popular , despite its expensive entrees . 
 Yes , sir . You're going to have a great time . 
 Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . 
 Okay , sir , bear with me a moment . 
 One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file . 
 I feel your pain , sir . 
 I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here . 
 I'd love to help you ! What is your budget for the dinner ? 
 Well , what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant ? It is very upscale , with a three-star rating . 
 The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated . It has great food and live jazz , but it's not cheap . 
 I'm already dialing , sir . 
 My pleasure ! How much would you like to spend on your date ? 
 You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris . The service and food are world-class . 
 You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern . It's famous for its food , service , and live jazz . 
 At once , sir . You'll love this place , I assure you . 
 Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' 
 Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . 
 Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge . 
 Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir . 
 I don't blame you , sir . Two dollars is a lot of money . 
 No problem , of course ! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady ? 
 Sir , the restaurant you seek is right here . This hotel has a three-star restaurant . 
 Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant . Plus , they have live jazz . 
 Right away , sir . She will be impressed with your local knowledge . 
 Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir . 
 You're right . It's only 9 
 Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit . 
 Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though . 
 Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour . 
 I'm ready when you are , sir . 
 You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine . 
 Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely . 
 Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes . 
 Just say the word , sir . 
 I agree . The dew is still on the grass . 
 We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit . 
 Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit . 
 Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away . 
 That won't be a problem , sir . 
 You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you . 
 We have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit . 
 Just present your VISA card , and there won't be any problems . 
 Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time . 
 Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you . 
 There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . 
 You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . 
 I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card . 
 Don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out . 
 We have a variety of transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ? 
 Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine . That's such a stylish way to travel . 
 And what is your destination ? 
 I see . What time do you want to depart from the hotel ? 
 Okay , a taxi will arrive in seconds , sir . 
 It won't be but a few seconds , sir . 
 We have various transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle ? 
 May I suggest a limo ? It's nice to pamper yourself . 
 I understand . And where will you be going ? 
 And what time would you like to be picked up ? 
 A taxi will be here shortly , sir . 
 A taxi it is , sir . 
 You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi . We can offer you a private vehicle . 
 Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi . 
 No upgrade of any kind . And where might you be going ? 
 When shall I tell the taxi to be here ? 
 The taxi will be here immediately , sir . 
 You won't have to wait a second , sir . 
 We offer various types of transportation . Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle ? 
 In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . 
 Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ? 
 What time do you want to leave the hotel ? 
 I'll call the taxi immediately , sir . 
 A brand new taxi is pulling up now . 
 oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday . 
 yes , please . Do you take credit cards ? 
 and how about Internet access ? 
 is it available in the rooms ? 
 that's OK . Is breakfast included ? 
 fantastic . Thank you very much . 

Could you please reserve a taxi for me ? 
 A private vehicle ? No , thanks , I won't need one . 
 T A X I , please . 
 Rockefeller Center . Can you get the taxi here immediately , please ? 
 Good . I'll get my coat and come downstairs . 

I need a taxi . 
 No , the taxi will do . 
 No , thank you . Taxis and I get along just fine . 
 I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center . 
 I'm ready to go right now . 
 Great ! As soon as I brush my teeth , I'll be downstairs . 

Hello . I have a room booked for tonight , the 15th . 
 It ’ s Marcia Gleason . 
 Yes , a single , thanks . 
 Actually , I ’ d prefer not to be . 
 Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form . 
 Business . I have a trade convention I'm attending in Chicago . 
 No . I will fly back twelve days from now . 
 Yes , I want to spend a couple days in New York . I have friends there I will visit . 
 Just my cameras , my clothes , and some books . 
 No . 
 Alright . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet . 
 Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a metro card at the station . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , do you have any rooms available ? 
 No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car . 
 Ok ... Here you are . 
 Is breakfast included ? 

Can I see your ticket please ? 
 Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ? 
 And would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 Boarding time is ten 20am . 
 Gate 29C . Have a nice flight . 
 No , my company makes cameras.Well , I'm also a photographer , but two of these are for our display . 
 Egg tarts . 
 I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables . 
 Confiscate ? 
 It's too bad . They are very delicious . 
 Oh , well . Not by me . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ? 
 My name is Judy Wang . 
 My first name is J-U-D-Y , and my last name is W-A-N-G . 
 It ’ s OK . Where should I pay for the penalty ? 
 That ’ s 1POJ7403 . 
 Thank you ! 
 No , thanks . I ’ m all set . Good-bye . 
 Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . 
 About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . 
 Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . 
 Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
 Have a great trip . 
 how long is it altogether ? 
 that sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . 
 then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . 
 this path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ? 
 then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . 
 how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? 
 that ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? 

I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses . 
 Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable . 
 Look at that village ! 
 Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? 

how long will it take us to drive to London ? 
 that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . 
 so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? 
 no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car . 
 wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . 

So , what do you plan to do today ? 
 Did you buy tickets already ? 
 Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets . 
 Outside , on the sidewalk . 
 The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people . 
 Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA . 
 I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters . 
 You can take a bus . 

excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ? 
 how far up the street are the traffic lights ? 
 ok . So I turn right at the traffic lights . Then ? 
 ok . Where do I go then ? 
 got it . Thank you very much . 
 I want to book a tour with adventure sports . 
 I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? 
 What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next ! 
 I ’ m thinking something exciting but safer . 
 That ’ s more like it ! 
 Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . 
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife . 
 I think something in the countryside would be nice . 
 Sounds good ! What is the hotel that we will be staying at like ? 
 Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? 
 I ’ m sold ! I want to book this trip . I don ’ t care what it costs ! Money is no object ! 
 We want to see the Statue of Liberty too . 
 You have never gone to the Statue of Liberty ? ! I can't believe it ! But you live here ! 
 I know . Are the subway trains easy to take here ? 
 I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! 
 Go alone if you want . I will wait at that cafe and have a soda . 
 I know . But if you don't go in the Haunted House , you won't be happy.So I will wait for you . It's no problem . 
 How was it ? 
 Don't worry about it . But how was it ? 
 Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good . 
 It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ? 
 Good . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . 
 I think we might not see any . 
 I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . 
 Yes , but I still think it could be better . 
 No , I don't want to . 
 Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ? 
 Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world . 
 Yes . That is something I will enjoy . 
 We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like . 
 Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here . 

May I help you ? 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 I'm sorry , Ma'am . I can't find anything under that name.Do you have your confirmation number ? 
 Well , let me look again . How do you spell your first name , Ma'am ? 
 I don't find a Carol in the computer for today . I have a Carol Larson here . But that reservation is for next Monday . 
 Are you sure he used your name , Ma'am ? Maybe he reserved under his name . 
 I'm sorry . I have nothing here . 

I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip . 
 What would you like to do today ? 
 I thought we could go to some of the museums.Don ' t you want to see the museums ? 
 I don't agree . I think the Capitol building is the most famous.But okay . If you want to see the White House , we'll go see it . I'm just afraid it will be boring . 

Excuse me , but I ’ m a bit lost here . Where does this street lead to ? 
 So is it the right way to the City Hall ? 

But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . 
 Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . 
 So I can't take my gun then . 
 Yes , it's true I don't . 
 What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? 
 I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? 
 Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . 
 That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? 

Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 O . K . Ticket , please . 
 Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ? 
 Very well . Do you have any bags to check ? 
 Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint . 
 Have a nice day . 

Ladies and gentlemen , our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport . 
 We'll be delayed for one hour , because the airport is very crowded . 
 Oh , will you ? That's too bad.We ' re very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble . 

Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Sure we do . First-class or economy ? 

Oh , what a relief ! Thank you very much for your help , Miss . 
 Excuse me , Miss.My friend is sick . 
 Yes.Please give him some water . 
 And do you have any medicine for airsickness ? 
 I appreciate your help . 
 Do you have air ticket and claim tag ? 
 Well , then , would you fill out this PIR from ? And also we need your signature here . 
 Hopefully by tomorrow evening.Which hotel are you going to stay ? 
 When is the expected date of your departure ? 

Open you suitcase , please . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Any cigarette , liquor ? 
 What's this white powder ? Are they drugs ? 
 May I open one of these ? Let me taste it . 

Hello , is this housekeeper ? 
 This is room eleven-seven and we have just checked in . 
 Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your housekeepers to clean up our room ? 
 Our room number is eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen . 

You should have been at home and enjoyed a big meal . 
 But now you can stay with friends and enjoy a holiday too .

 You're right.We have no more rooms available for tonight . 
 OK , I'll call ahead . 
 Something important ? 
 Tickets ? What tickets ?

 Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow . 
 Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ? 
 Sorry . 
 Our 10th wedding anniversary ? 
 Darling . I think you have made a mistake . 
 Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago . 
 Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day . 
 Since you have booked . Then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand . 
 Yes , a little . 
 I'm sorry . I can't quite follow you . Would you mind speaking slowly ? 
 Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left .

Hello.This is room 1205.Our message lamp is flaming . 
 Thank you . 
 Would you bring the message to my room ? 
 Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately . 

I have a reservation for a single with a bath . 
 What's the room rate ? It's little expensive for me.Do you have any other room ? 
 May I see the room ? I'll take this room . Is the rate for a room only ? 

Look , George , There's the Great Wall . 
 Yeah , it stretches over for thousands of miles . 
 Where can we climb it ? 
 Well , we could take the cable car . 
 Okay . Let's go . 
 But we made it . 
 It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago . 
 There are so many ancient relics in China . 
 I'm afraid you're going in the opposite direction . Go back the way you came , and take the second turn on the left . The museum is straight ahead , right in front of you . 
 Well , it's about fifteen minutes ' walk . 
 You may take a No . 34 bus . And the subway can also take you there . 
 My pleasure . 
 What kind of bag is it ?

 We're rather busy right now.It will take another 15 minutes . 
 I'm afraid it would take 15 minutes at most . 

I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room . 
 It's . I think , neighbours on the right . 
 I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep . 
 If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ? 
 Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ? 
 I'm afraid , ma'am , you have to pay U . S . $ 100 since you lost the key . 
 I'm afraid no.It is not covered by this insurance . 
 You can take the subway to get there 
 It ’ s takes only about 10 minutes 
 You can take No . 1 bus or taxi 
 Pleas turn right at the traffic lights . 

Well , we didn't ask for this room service.It must be somebody else's , I'm sure .

I'm afraid I have lost my air ticket while I was shopping . 
 Yes , I checked again and again , but I can't find it . By the day after tomorrow , can I have the ticket reissued ?

Hi ! I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning .

 Actually , can I change the latter wake-up call to 7 thirty . am ?

I have a stomachache . 
 All right . I'll do that .

 Yes . I ’ Ve got an infected wound . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 I ’ ll bring the card . Thank you very much . 

What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . 
 And what's the cause of that ? 
 But I can't just slow down . 
 You mean I've got to lose weight ? 

What's the matter with my wife ? 
 I guess so . It was very terrible when she was at the onset of the illness . I am worried that I would lose her . 
 I know . But is she out of danger now ? 
 Thank you very much , Doctor . 

Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . 
 Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf . 
 Yes , right over here . 
 Here's a twenty . 

You look pale , Paul . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Anything I can do for you ? 

Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
 What seems to be the trouble now ? 
 Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know . 
 And what about dinner ? 
 That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ? 

You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after 
 The operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . But you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . If your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 . 
 It's nothing . Did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ? 
 OK . Have you signed the consent ? 

Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . 
 What if it's broken ? 

Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? 
 Have you ever had any trauma ? 
 Does the pian become more intense at night ? 
 Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? 
 I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . 
 Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension.We ' ll try it every day for seven days.Will that be all right ? 

Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly . 
 Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . 
 All right . 
 Well , this one is worse . 
 I can only read the first three lines . 
 Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . 
 Here you are . 
 I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing . 

Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . 
 OK.Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . 
 Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? 
 In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . 
 Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . 
 When it comes to that , I have a lot to say . 
 When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said . 
 He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me . 
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .

 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
 Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
 Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . 
 I don't know , but I feel terrible . 
 Do you think I should lie in bed ? 
 OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ? 
 OK , I'll listen to you .

 Yes , I ache all over . 
 A little bit . 
 It's gone completely . 
 Is that all doctor ? 
 Thank you , doctor . Goodbye . 

What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . 
 And what's the cause of that ? 
 But I can't just slow down . 
 You mean I've got to lose weight ? 

Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ? 
 I see . When did it start ? 
 Have you got a temperature ?

 No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . 
 Three times a day after meals . 

Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down .

 Oh , doctor . Do I have to ? I am afraid of needles ! 
 Oh , doctor , please ... 
 You are right . I won't cry anymore . 
 Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning . 
 I will get better soon . 
 Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams . 
 Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it . 
 Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles . 
 May told you ? Oh , May , she's such a tattletale . 
 Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ? 
 Deal . 
 Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . 

Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
 What seems to be the trouble now ? 
 Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know . 
 And what about dinner ? 
 That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ? 

I went to the doctor yesterday . 
 I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
 He said I ' d got the flu . 
 He told me to stay in bed for ten days . 
 Yes , ten days . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts .

What can I do for you ? 
 For whom ? 
 What symptoms does he have ? 
 I got it . Don't worry , just a common cold . 
 Patulin will do . 
 Six per day , and two after each meal . 
 My pleasure . 
 Sorry . I was too worried . 
 Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? 
 I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . 

Here you are . How is Danny ? 
 What did the doctor say ? 
 Shall we go back home now ? 
 I bought some advanced medicine . Is there anything you need ? 
 Now what ? 
 Okay , this is the third time . 
 You don't have to know . Bye for now . 

What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me examine you.Don ' t worry.It ' s nothing serious . 
 Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water.Your fever will be gone in a day or two .

 No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . 
 Three times a day after meals . 

Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . 
 All right , doctor . But it really hurts . 
 Good afternoon.It ' s very nice to see you again . 
 I'm much better.The stomachache is gone , and the doctor is about to give me another endoscope examination to see whether the ulcer has healed . 
 How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much . 
 You're so thoughtful ! 
 Thank you for coming.Good - bye . 
 Yes , I've been given so much , that I simply don't know what to do with it all . 
 What about these ? 
 I see.Thank you , doctor . 
 That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .

 You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye . 
 No , I haven't been registered . 
 I'm a medical case . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 The doctor told me to stay about one month . 
 Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back . 

Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Do you often suffer from backache ? 
 When did it start ? 
 Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better . 
 Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ... 
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
 I think so . I feel very hot . 
 I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How often must I take it ? 
 Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got a terrible stomach-ache and I keep needing the toilet . 
 Well , I went to a seafood restaurant last night and I ate lots of oysters . 
 Ok . Thank you very much .

 I don't know , but I feel terrible . 
 Do you think I should lie in bed ? 
 OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ? 
 OK , I'll listen to you . 
 Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect . 
 Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . 
 Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine .

 Okay , Mr . Horn , see you tomorrow at 10:30 . 
 Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?

 Have you taken any medicine ? 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go to see the doctor . That might help . And you'd better stay in bed today instead of going to work . 
 Yeah , the doctor said that I can leave soon . I really miss home . 
 Yeah , you are right . But I have to stay for another day for observation . 
 No , thanks . I am very grateful that you can come to the hospital to visit me . 

My wife is sick , so I have to cancel a reservation I made . 
 I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234 , April ninth to the fifteenth . 
 I wish everything in life was so simple . Thank you . 

Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes.we have herb medicine and ready-made medicine .

 I couldn't sleep well recently . 
 I always drink too much wine in the evening . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Many thanks for your advice . 
 Of course I know . 
 OK . I'll go right now . By the way , do you think I ’ ll have to stay in the hospital for long ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . I will go now . Bye-bye . 

Excuse me . Miss , what does the doctor say about me ? When can I be discharged ? 
 Great , thanks . But how can I get discharged ? 
 Yes , I will . Thanks for your care . 
 Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn . 
 Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow . 
 In the morning , if possible . 
 That would be fine . 

Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . 
 Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf . 
 Yes , right over here . 
 Here's a twenty . 

Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat . 
 Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription . 
 Goodbye , Randy . Take care . 
 I'm fine , Dr . Beecham . Yes , just a cleaning and check-up today . 
 ( She probed my teeth and checked my gums . ) Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them . 
 Since you had that done here , we'll take care of it . There won't be a charge . And , your insurance should cover the work on the cavity . Now , I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work . 

I have a terrible toothache . 
 ( Pointing ) This one here . 
 Can you fill it ? 
 Then I might as well have it out now . 

What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Brown ? 
 Oh , in what way ? 
 Did you lose any weight ? 
 When was the last time you had a check-up ? 
 Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic . 
 You're just a little run-down from overwork . 
 I think all you need is just a vacation . 
 Thank you , doctor . I'll do as you say . 
 I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold . 
 I was sick most of the night . 
 Have I got a high fever ? 
 Yes , I have . 
 Aaaaahh , aaaaahh . 
 All right , thanks . 
 What shall I do today ? 

I'm very worried , doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill . 
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . 
 Very badly , doctor . 
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . 

A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . 
 Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . 
 But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! 

I've got a headache and sore throat . 
 It all started the day before yesterday . 
 What should I do ? 

Have you got anything for diarrhea ? 
 How should I take this medicine ? 
 I see . I'll follow your instructions . 
 Thank you . 
 I've got a headache and a cough . 
 What should I do , doctor ? 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 My head hurts badly . 
 Since last night . 
 Yes , I even can't fall asleep these days . 
 Is it serious , Doctor ? 
 OK , thank you , Doctor . 
 I don't feel like eating . And I cannot sleep well . 
 Yes , a low fever . I feel terrible . Am I dying ? 
 Before the meals or after the meals ? 

Good morning . 
 What's the problem ? 
 How long have you had that problem ? 
 Then , you'd better go to the Medical Department . But first , you should fill in the registration card and the registration fee is one Yuan .

 You're welcome . 
 Yes , and it is 37 ° C .

 What symptoms does he have ? 
 How long did the convulsion last ? 
 Does he have any other complaints ? 
 Have you taken his temperature ? 
 Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . 
 No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . 
 No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink . 

What's wrong with you ? 
 Don't worry . I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders . 

I have a sore throat and my chest hurts .

Now , what seems to be the trouble ? 
 Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? 
 I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . 

What's the matter with you , Paul ? 
 Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 

Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ? 
 What are your symptoms ? 
 It sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? 
 Have you been drinking plenty of water ? 
 Ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . 
 Is anyone else sick in your home ? 
 I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The nurse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us by this afternoon . 

I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . 
 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
 Yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . 
 No , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . 
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
 No , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . 
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
 Just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . 
 that sounds good .

 You ’ re welcome . 
 I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation . 
 Yes , she's free then . 
 I strongly urge you to change your diet.You shouldn't eat too many desserts . 
 You should go to the dentist . 
 Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
 Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .

 Well , you'd better sit down for this . It has been terminal lung cancer . 
 We ’ ll try our best , but you'd better prepare for the worst .

 Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache . 
 Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I ’ m afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible . 
 Ah . 
 What am I supposed to do then ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I need some medicine . 
 My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . 
 Fever and a bad cough . 
 What kind of medicine does she need ? 
 How many pills for each time ? 
 Thank you very much . 

Doctor , here's my report for my IVP examination . 
 Oh , yes , is it dangerous ? 
 Do I have to have an operation ? 
 Good , I can still attend the Olympic Games . 
 Oh , I've heard a lot about the Chinese herbal medicine . I believe it will work . 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? 
 About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot . 
 First , I'll clean up the wound and then dress it . 
 Take it easy . It's not serious . You should keep the wound very clean . 
 Thank you very much , doctor . 

I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts . 
 It all started the day before yesterday . 
 What should I do ? 

I feel dizzy and I have a headache . 
 Since yesterday . 
 But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us . 
 Of course . I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth . 

Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
 I hate dentists . 
 It always hurts . I hate going . 
 O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . 

I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling well . How are you ? 
 Is that so ? But I think It shouldn't keep you long in bed . 

Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
 Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . 
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
 Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . 

How do I use this adhesive ? 
 How do I use the lotion ? 
 Well , thanks very much . 

How do I take the tablets ? 
 How do I take the sucking lozenges ? 
 How do I take the pills ? 
 Well , thanks very much . 

What happened to you ? 
 Do you have any symptoms ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 It's not serious . 
 Yes . 
 You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise . 
 One second , please . All right , here are your painkillers . 
 You are welcome ! 
 Please dissolve the powder in hot water . Soak your hand or foot in it for 20 minutes twice a day . 
 Put the eye-drop into your right eye 4 - - 6 times a day , 1 - - 2 drops each time . Squeeze a bit of the ointment on your eyelid every night . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat . 

My toothache started nearly a month ago . The pain's been keeping me awake . Would you please have a look ? 
 The one right at the back . 
 Will it hurt much ? 
 ( 5 minutes later ) OK , it's all over . Spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour . 
 I have a bad headache . 
 For two days . 
 I ’ m afraid so . Sometimes I feel hot and sometimes I feel cold . 

Which department do you want to register with ? 
 Please pay the registration fee , 10 Yuan . 

What's the matter with my throat , doctor ? 
 Is it serious ? 

Hi . I need a wake-up call tomorrow . 
 I need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . 
 Then again , I think 7 fifteen is too early . Change 7 fifteen to 7 thirty , please . 
 Not just now , but if I do think of something later , I'll give you a ring . 

Hi . Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow ? 
 I need two wake-up calls , if you don't mind , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 On second thought , you'd better make that second call at 7 thirty instead of 7 fifteen . 
 No , that gets it for now , thank you . 

Hello ! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call . 
 I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . 
 Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ? 
 No , that's about it for now . Thanks . 

Hello , I've got to get up early tomorrow , so please give me a wake-up call . 
 Actually , I need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 Wait a minute ! I don't like 7 fifteen , now that I think about it . Change it to 7 thirty . 
 Nothing that I can think of right now . If something comes up , though , I'll call you . 

I'd like to order a restock on my minibar .

There's a big problem with my room . I'm in 507 . 
 I have cockroaches crawling in my room . 
 I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see . 
 How dare you question my statement ! 

I have a little problem with room 507 . 
 I found cockroaches in my room . 
 I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room . 
 There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! 

I'm in 507 . I have a few problems with my room . 
 There are cockroaches in my room . 
 I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one . 
 You dare to doubt me ? 

I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! 
 Cockroaches have taken over my room ! 
 Thank you . I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others . 

I'm in 507 , and I have a big problem . 
 Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches . 
 The next cockroach I see will be number ten . 
 I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! 

There's a major problem with room 507 . 
 This room is overrun with cockroaches . 
 I stopped counting at nine . 
 Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . 

I want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight . 
 I'm knee-deep in cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact . 

I have a little problem with room 507 . 
 This room is filthy with cockroaches . 
 I've already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough ! 
 You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! 

I'm quite upset ! I want a new room and a refund for tonight . 
 I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I didn't want to have to take this to court . 

I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . 
 Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? 
 Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? 
 Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? 
 Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . 

I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here . 
 Swim stations ? Whoever heard of such a thing ? 
 All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ? 
 Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ? 
 Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks ! 

I have a reservation . My name is John Sandals . 
 Certainly . Here it is . 
 Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ? 
 Okay . Here's my VISA card . 
 Yes , it sounds like everything I expected . 

Hi , I have a reservation under the name of Sandals . 
 Of course ! Let me take it out of my wallet . 
 Yes , of course . Is American Express okay ? 
 In that case , here's my VISA . 
 Yes , I'm easy to please . 

I've got a reservation here . My name is John Sandals . 
 One second , please , while I dig it out . Here . 
 Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ? 
 That's okay , I've got plenty of cards . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that's just what I wanted . 

Hello . My name is John Sandals , and I've got a reservation . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 I sure do . How about American Express ? 
 No American Express ? Okay , here's my VISA . 
 Yeah , that'll be fine . 

Hi , I'm John Sandals , and I have a reservation . 
 Here you go . 
 Certainly ! Would you like my American Express card ? 
 I thought American Express was accepted everywhere . Never mind . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that's just fine . 

Hello ! My name is Sandals , I have a reservation . 
 Here you are . 
 Of course . Will American Express do ? 
 No problem . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that sounds like what I want . 

I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop . 
 Well , I don't have an Ethernet port . My computer runs entirely on wireless service . 
 Yes , please ! Tell me about the alternatives . 
 Very good . How much does that cost ? 
 I see . And the other alternatives ? 
 Great ! What if I need to print something in the lobby ? 

I'm looking for a good multivitamin . Can you recommend one ? 
 I knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge ! 
 That's right . Just a simple multi-vitamin that I can take every day . 
 Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one . 

Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room . 
 My name is John Sandals . 
 I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 . 
 How much per night are we talking about ? 
 That price is perfectly acceptable . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 That sounds fine . 
 Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 . 

Ahhchooo ! 
 No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . 
 Consider yourself lucky . 
 Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . 
 No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? 
 Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . 
 That's pretty bad . 

Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ? 
 It sounds like you're coming down with something . 
 I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . 
 Good , but can you tell me how to get to your office ? 
 Am I allowed to eat spicy food ? 
 Really , because spicy food is my favorite . 
 I'm not feeling well , doctor . I have a sore throat . 
 Yes , my back aches . 
 It began the night before last . 
 Lots of people are ill at the moment . 

This room is unacceptable . I want a new one , and I want a refund for tonight . 
 I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! 
 Thank you very much . This has been a most unsettling experience . 

What's wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel tired ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you . 
 Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . 
 Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir . 
 Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . 
 Sir , without happy guests , we are nothing . 
 If you tell me the exact problem , I can be more helpful . 
 Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight . 
 Sir , only your mother wants to please you more than we do . 
 Yes , we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons , including fitness . 
 The gym is just below the lobby . Take the elevator or the stairs . You can't miss it . 
 No , the gym is free to guests . Take your room key , however , so you can get in . 
 The gym is open seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day . 
 Unfortunately , no . If you want a trainer , you'll have to use another gym . 
 Yes , sir . We try to anticipate all our guests ' needs , including fitness . 
 Sir , the gym is just below the lobby . You can take the elevator or the stairs . 
 No , sir . It's gratis . Just take your room key so you can get in . 
 You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7 . 
 I'm sorry , but no . We used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident . 
 But of course ! We have a great exercise facility . 
 It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down . 
 No , sir . The gym is absolutely free . However , be sure to take your room key with you . 
 The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 . 
 I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't . 
 Yes , sir . We have a fine exercise facility . 
 You're actually standing above it . Just take the elevator or stairs down one level . 
 No , sir . There's no extra charge . All you need is your room key to open the door . 
 Sir , you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes . 
 We might be getting one in the near future . But at the present time , no . 
 Yes , sir . I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory . 
 It's only one flight down , sir . Just take the elevator or the stairs . 
 Sir , you can use the gym for free . All you need is your room key . 
 Sir , our gym is open around the clock , every day of the week . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but we have no trainer . 
 I'm sorry , sir , we don't have one . However , in our gym , we do have swim stations . 
 Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current . 
 Sir , guests pay nothing to use the stations . 
 The gym is open 24/7 , but the stations are open from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . only . 
 I think you'll like the experience , sir . It's a great workout . 
 We don't have a full-sized swimming pool , but we do have individual swim stations . 
 Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim . 
 If you're a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations . 
 To conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7a . m . till 10 . 
 I don't think you'll be disappointed . People really seem to like the swim stations . 
 Is everything OK ? 
 So , since when is your house a bank ? 
 I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . 
 What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? 
 OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? 

Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? 
 Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky.Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ah . 
 Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? 
 Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch o 
 Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo 
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . 

Hello sir , how can I help you ? 
 Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ? 
 Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day.Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol ! 
 Okay , anything else I can get you ? 
 Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system . 
 Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on Fun Times Ribbed Condoms please ! 
 Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . 
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 
 Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! 
 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . 
 I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! 
 Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . 
 Is it gonna hurt ? 

Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
 Yes , I need to refill it today . 
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 

What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? 
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! 
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! 
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! 

Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ? 
 It is very confusing to know what to eat . 
 Are there certain things that I should avoid ? 
 After watching my diet , what else should I do ? 
 Can I have a glass of wine now and then ? 

Doctor , can you give me some suggestions on how to stay healthy ? 
 What are the best foods to eat ? 
 What should I avoid ? 
 What else is important to stay healthy ? 
 Is it OK to drink alcohol ? 

Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ? 
 Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are . 
 What things should I avoid ? 
 Beyond diet , what else can I do to be healthy ? 
 How about having a beer on the weekend ? 

Everything's gone wrong . 
 What are we going to do now ? 

Okay , so we're agreed on 900 . 
 Let's shake on it . 

Did you take the job ? 
 Why not ? 

Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ? 
 This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ? 
 Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ? 
 I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ? 
 Thank you very much . Goodbye . 

I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? 
 I want to have a foot massage and a haircut . 
 Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures . 
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? 
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 
 That ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet . 

Look , Bob hasn't made any progress on that project . 
 We should have a word with him . 

What is that plastic cup for ? 
 Am I supposed to pee into the cup ? 
 Then what do I do with the cup ? 
 What is this test for ? 
 When will I know the results ? 

Hi Bob , I won't be in work tomorrow . 
 I have a dentist appointment . 

What am I supposed to do with this plastic cup ? 
 How , exactly , does this work ? 
 When I finish , what should I do then ? 
 What is my doctor testing me for ? 
 Will I know the results right away ? 

Why are you handing me a plastic cup ? 
 How am I supposed to do that ? 
 What am I supposed to do with the cup when I am done ? 
 What kind of test is this ? 
 How long will it take to get the results ? 

Hi , I was wondering if you have my test results in . 
 So , basically , I am OK ? 
 What will I learn when I see the results on the website ? 
 What will the numbers tell me ? 
 Are all of my test results on that site ? 

Is there a medication you can prescribe to help me with my problem ? 
 What is available ? 
 Are there many side effects ? 
 Is that the only medication I need to take ? 
 What are the side effects of that drug ? 

Can you help me find a lotion for a problem I am having ? 
 I have poison oak , and I need help with the rash that won ’ t stop itching . 
 Which one is best ? 
 Can I do anything else to help with the itching ? 
 I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching . 

Hello , could you tell me my test results ? 
 Are you saying that all my results were normal ? 
 How will I know what the results mean on the website ? 
 Will the numbers mean anything to me ? 
 Can I see all of my test results at once ? 

Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . 
 Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ? 
 Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? 
 How will I know what the numbers mean ? 
 How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? 

Can I get some medicine to help me ? 
 What types of drugs can I try ? 
 What about side effects from that medication ? 
 Do I only need to take that one drug ? 
 What can I expect when I take that medication ? 

The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn . 
 What is this test for ? 
 What does that tell him ? 
 Will the blood test hurt ? 
 Ouch ! 

What about a medication to help me with my problem ? 
 What types of medications would be best ? 
 What are the side effects from taking that drug , 
 Will that one medication take care of all of my problems ? 
 Am I going to experience any complications with that drug ? 

My doctor says that I need a blood test . 
 What are you taking my blood for ? 
 What information does that give him ? 
 Is a blood test painful ? 
 Oh , my God , that hurts ! 

Have you been having any problems lately ? 
 Do you have a history of high blood pressure ? 
 High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms . 
 We are going to use this cuff here , and it will give me a reading . 
 They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood . 

I came to this lab to have my blood drawn . 
 What am I being tested for ? 
 What does my white blood cell count tell him ? 
 How much will it hurt ? 
 Is that my blood going into that tube ? 

How have you been feeling lately ? 
 Has your blood pressure been high before ? 
 Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer . 
 I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading . 
 I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest . 

Hi , what brings you to my office today ? 
 Have you had the flu lately ? 
 Have you ever been tested for allergies ? 
 Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ? 
 I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma . 

Hello , how are you doing today ? 
 Have you had any type of cold lately ? 
 Do you have any allergies that you know of ? 
 Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ? 
 I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma . 

Have you been feeling OK lately ? 
 Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ? 
 People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer . 
 We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading . 
 It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest . 

Good morning , how have you been doing ? 
 Have you had any type of bug lately ? 
 Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ? 
 Does this happen more when you are under stress ? 
 I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma . 

What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 Do you have any friend you would call really close ones ? 
 What kind of people would you like to work with ? 
 What kind of people you find hard to work with ? 

Bob , What are you thinking about ? 
 Do you think it'll work ? 

Doctor , I have the worst toothache ! 
 For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days . 
 You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one . 
 I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush . 
 Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that . 
 Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son . 
 Thanks . I appreciate it . 
 And what did you decide ? 
 I'm glad you saw the reason . 
 Mary's is handling it . 
 Of course . Mary is our most experienced member . 
 Why ? What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I'll get Bob to cover you . 
 It makes no sense to tell him about that . 
 Because he'll tell Mary and that will cause us problems . 
 Okay , let's call it a day . 
 Okay , Bob , when will I see you ? 
 Okay , I'll see you later . 
 Has he been late before ? 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Why ? 
 I realize that but I needed to make a decision . 
 Yes , I'm looking for Bob . 
 No problem , I can wait . 
 It's the key for the safety deposit box . 
 You're welcome , glad to be of assistance . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I'll speak to him . 
 Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . 
 Has anybody spoken to him about it ? 
 We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? 
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? 
 With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . 
 Let's rock n ' roll . 
 All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ? 
 That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . 
 Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? 
 The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great ! 
 Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . 

Hello , Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . 
 Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? 
 How about Friday afternoon ? 

Kim , have you made contact with Mr . Lee ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Maybe his phone is out of order . Anyway , keep working on it . I really need an answer about the contract I sent him . 

Linda , it's really late . Let's call it a day . 
 Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ? 
 Don't mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . 

Mrs . Lee , I ’ Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow . 
 Thank you . You ’ Ve been so nice to me . 
 No , thanks . You ’ Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything . 

Oh , this is Monica 
 Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . 
 Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? 
 And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? 
 I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? 
 What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? 

I've been working hard for a whole year . I really need a break . 
 You said it . I'm looking forward to my annual vacation . 
 Later this month . I can't wait ! 

Your PC is so amazing . Are you doing trade on internet ? 
 I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet . 
 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? 
 What advantages does it have ? 
 I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . 
 So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 
 Will you give me some suggestion ? 
 Thank you . Maybe I will do business through internet in the future . 
 Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends . 
 Sometime next year . 
 The same to you . Keep in touch . 
 That ’ s true . I got the news yesterday . 
 Not bad . I ’ m confident . And I like challenges . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm doing the business online . 
 E-commerce , or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet . 
 We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on . 
 Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet . 

Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . 
 That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . 
 I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . 

I know that you are interested in our washers . 
 We supply washers of all types and sizes . We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers . 
 Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else . Here are our latest price lists . You will see that our prices are very attractive . 
 Sure , we do . 
 As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months . 
 Okay . No problem . 
 Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . 
 What are you thinking about ? 
 Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? 

This is our best product . 
 They'll be done before the end of the week . 

Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? 
 I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . 
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Your prescription will be ready in twenty minutes . 
 Yes , in fact , you can renew this prescription over the Internet and have it delivered to your home . 
 You should take it twice a day . 
 You need something in your stomach when you take it . Don ’ t drink alcohol with this medication . 
 Sometimes you might feel dizzy , but that isn ’ t common . 
 You can come back in twenty minutes , and it will be ready . 
 Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO . 
 You need to take it at bedtime . 
 Don ’ t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food . 
 You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass . 
 Sure , what is the problem ? 
 I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream . 
 Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer . 
 You can take an antihistamine . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help . 
 You may pick it up in twenty minutes . 
 Yes , and you can renew this prescription by phone . 
 Take it three times a day . 
 You should take this medicine with food and no alcohol . 
 You might get a little dizzy , but that is it . 
 I can ’ t sleep or eat . I have a really bad pain in my tooth ! 
 It bothers me off and on , but it ’ s gotten much worse these past few weeks . 
 My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep . Maybe that is the problem . 
 I use a soft bristle toothbrush . 
 Absolutely . That set it off big time ! 
 It would be my pleasure to help you . What do you need help with ? 
 We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream . 
 I have heard that the cream is longer lasting . 
 If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot . 
 It was a pleasure . Come back anytime . 
 My tooth is killing me ! 
 It just started hurting me last night . 
 I think one of my fillings might be coming loose . 
 I have an electric toothbrush . 
 Oh yeah , when I do that , it hurts a lot more ! 
 No problem . Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back . 
 You will stand over here up against this plate . 
 You will raise your arms up shoulder high . 
 Yes , you are doing great . 
 I need to stand behind this shield . Now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out . 
 That ’ s it . You can get dressed when the film is developed . 
 I will need you to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the gown , leaving the opening in the back . 
 I will need you to face this glass plate right over here . 
 Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height . 
 So far , so good . 
 I am not leaving . I just need you to take a really deep breath , hold it , and then let it out . 
 You will be able to put your clothes on as soon as I have checked the film . 
 I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach . 
 I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch . 
 Perhaps , but I haven ’ t felt well for a few days now . 
 My stress level is pretty much what is usually is . 
 It seems to me like I may have caught a bug . 
 My stomach is bothering me . 
 I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . 
 It could be bad food , but I didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either . 
 I haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual . 
 I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu . 
 Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . 
 You need to come over here and face this plate . 
 I will need your arms raised to shoulder height . 
 Everything you are doing is perfect . 
 I am just getting behind this screen . You need to take a deep breath , hold it , and then breathe normally . 
 You can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . We will be all done here . 
 I have a major stomachache 
 I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch . 
 Yes , that could have been it , but I haven ’ t been feeling that great for the past few days . 
 Not really . Things have been going OK . 
 I think that I might be getting the flu . 
 I feel horrible . I think I picked up a bug . 
 A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there . 
 I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . 
 My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . 
 Yes , if I get worse , I will definitely look for extra help with this . 
 I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . 
 My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me . 
 Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup . 
 My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . 
 If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions . 
 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . 
 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! 
 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the 
 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . 
 Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . 

hello ! How are you . 
 what have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? 
 perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . 
 well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . 
 OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . 
 good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve got a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ? 
 yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . 
 OK . I can afford to take a fell days off work . 
 yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . 
 I have a bad headache , but ... 
 thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . 
 But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! 
 I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
 I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
 A little , but not much . 
 If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? 

Hello , I want to know how much it costs to have a manicure and pedicure . 
 That's nice . I'd like to give it a try . I think I like passion red . please . 
 No . 
 Square . But with round at the edges , please . 
 How long will it take to get them dry ? 
 I see , thank you . 
 yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed.His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . 
 you have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from tom ? 
 he might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy . 
 it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look . 
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . 

I'd like a facial . 
 Which would you recommend ? 
 What does it included ? 
 Does it include facial mask and massage ? 
 Will it exfoliate the skin as well ? 
 That sounds great . 
 Certainly , which color do you want to dye it ? 
 Right now , many girls are dyeing there hair blond . 
 What do you think about pink ? 
 Yes , we have several brands , which one do you prefer ? 
 First , you need a shampoo , it makes it easier for your hair to be dyed . Let's down your hair in the water , you hair will be fairly clean that way . 
 You hair is definitely fresh and shiner looking . 
 Better , thank you , doctor . 
 Certainly , doctor . Come upstairs . 
 Does he have a temperature , doctor ? 
 Must he stay in bed ? 
 He's in bed , doctor . Can you see him , please ? He has a bad cold , too ! 
 I want haircut and perm . 
 Just cut a little off . 
 I'd like to have medium . 
 Can you tell me my choices ? 
 I want the chocolate one . I want to have it the big waves . 
 Turn the chair I can see myself in the mirror . 
 Beautifully done , many thanks . 
 Good morning , nurse . I want to see the dentist , please . 
 No , I don't . 
 Yes , it is . It's very urgent . I feel awful . I have a terrible toothache . 
 I must see the dentist now , nurse . 
 That's very late . Can the dentist see me now ? 
 I can wait , but my toothache can't ! 
 I have a sore throat and headache . 
 Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible . 
 Ok , go ahead . 

Well , what is your trouble ? 
 Have you any aches and pains ? 
 I'll take your temperature . How long have you been feeling ill ? 
 You have a temperature , but it's nothing serious . It's probably just the flu . I'll give you a prescription . Take this to the chemist's . Take one tablet every four hours . You should stay in bed tom 
 It's this cold weather we're having . 
 I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . 
 I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired . 
 yes . I can't seem to drink enough . 
 no , just soda . 
 that seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill . 
 no , but my girlfriend has mono . 
 thanks . 
 What's the matter , Andy ? 
 Have you hurt yourself ? 
 Try and stand up . Can you stand up ? Here . Let me help you . 
 I think that the doctor had better see you . I'll telephone Dr Carter . The doctor says that he will come at once . I'm sure that you need an X-ray , Andy . 
 All right , but tell me what ’ s happening . Give it to me straight please . 
 And now ? 
 That ’ s great news . 
 That ’ s good to hear . She is usually full of vein and vigor . 
 Thanks for helping her , doctor . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
 I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? 
 Ok . 
 Yes . 
 I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . 
 Ok , thanks doctor . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 It has been two or three days . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . 
 How long have you had it ? 
 I think you've got a cold . 
 I'll give you some medicine , and you will be better in a couple of days . 

You don't look well at all . Are you sick ? 
 How long have you been feeling like this ? 
 How did you feel at the very beginning ? 
 I see . You've caught a bad cold . I'll give you a prescription . 

Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . 
 No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon . 
 He's on a weeklong meditation retreat and won't be back until this weekend . 
 My temperature is 39 degrees centigrade . 
 I didn't take my temperature but I felt feverish . 
 Doctor , I can't eat any foods because I had a sore throat . 

Lily ! Why aren't you up and ready for school ? 
 Lily , if you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky ... 
 Oh , that's a nasty cough . Let me feel your head . You're on fire ! 
 Well , we try ! Here , I just made some carrot juice . Would you like a glass ? 
 You don't have to go to the mountains ! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning ! 
 Have a good day at school ! See you tonight ! 
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . 
 When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? 
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . 

Mom ! ? ? ? 
 Mmm ... 
 I have the chills . Can you turn on the heater ? 

hey , you look great ! how's everything ? 
 really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . 
 you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . 
 sounds reasonable . 
 and fruits ! 
 I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
 I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . 

why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? 
 what are they ? 
 why ? 
 that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . 
 what's that ? 
 wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . 
 you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . 
 so what happened ? 
 you should have kept trying . 
 Over here , Betty ! 
 Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself . 
 No kidding ! What happened to Ad ? 
 Was , talk about a double whammy . 
 Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her . 
 Thanks for the visit , Betty . 
 Hi , this is Emily Wang , I want to see a doctor today . 
 GRM 789051 
 No . But it is urgent , and I need to see a doctor as soon as possible . I am really in bad shape . 
 I have a high fever and a bad headache . 
 Yes , I took my temperature last night . It was 102 degrees . But right now I feel my fevers is up to 103 degrees . 
 I can not stop coughing , and I can not stop sneezing . I vomited blood last night . Sorry , I am coughing again . 
 What time should I come ? 
 Ok . Thank you very much . 
 No , thanks . 
 well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? 
 how can you get that done ? 
 what else ? 
 sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 
 perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Good morning , Dr Lee . 
 Not very well . 
 I have nausea , and I am dizzy . Also I have a abdominal pain . 
 Here . 
 Sharp pain . 
 No , It is not continuous . It comes and goes . 
 All right . 
 No . 
 Not really . 
 For about a month . 
 I am eating pretty good . 
 No constipation . Everything seems OK . 
 Things are going well for me , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am applying for new health insurance , and I need a physical examination to qualify . 
 I ’ Ve been having a little trouble breathing . Would you look into that , please ? 
 I would appreciate it . When you give me a blood test , what are you looking for ? 
 I am expecting the tests to go well . I have been taking good care of myself . 
 I'm very worried , doctor 
 I'm afraid that I'm very ill . 
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little . 
 Very badly , doctor . 
 Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five . 
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . 
 Yes , doctor . ( The doctor examines the patient ) 
 No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? 
 But I may lose my job , doctor ! It's hard to get a job like mine . 
 You're right , doctor . It's more important to be healthy than wealthy . I'll change my job . I'm grateful for your advice . 

Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ? 
 Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ? 
 Did you eat any cake ? 
 Did you eat any ice cream ? 
 Did you eat any candy ? 
 Young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening . 
 I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ? 
 How many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ? 

Right . Just take off your jacket and shirt . And lie down on that bed over there ... That's right ... Now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? ... Does this hurt ? 
 And this ? 
 And do you feel anything when I do this ? 
 And you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? In you legs , for example ? 
 Well , it's probably nothing serious.But I think we'd better have that shoulder X-rayed.We can't do the until the morning , though.So it'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night 
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . 
 When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? 
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . 

Hello , I would like to speak with Ryan . 
 Ryan , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather . 
 I have a horrible rash from poison oak . 
 The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days . 
 I bought some over-the-counter lotion , and I am taking an antihistamine . 

Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ? 
 Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . 
 I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today . 
 I broke my leg , but it is healing . 
 I should be able to return by next Monday . 

Nice to see you ; how have you been feeling lately ? 
 I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical . 
 We are going to look at your heart and lungs , do a few blood tests , and see that your eyes , ears , and nose are all working as they should . 
 I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion . 
 The blood test is for cholesterol , white blood cell count , and blood sugar . 

Good morning , is this Ryan ? 
 Ryan , this is Malia , and I need to call in sick today . 
 I went hiking and have terrible poison oak . 
 I think I got it on Saturday , but it just showed up today . 
 The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot . 

Hi , may I speak to Ryan , please ? 
 Hi , Ryan , this is Malia , and I will not be coming to work today . 
 I have really bad poison oak and can ’ t stop itching . 
 I ’ Ve had it a few days , but the rash really got bad last night . 
 I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine . 

Good morning , may I speak with Professor Clark , please ? 
 Professor , I am Kalina from your morning literature class . 
 I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school . 
 I have a concussion , but I will be OK . 
 I only need to take this week off . 

Hello , is this Professor Clark ? 
 Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings . 
 I was partying hard over the weekend , fell down the stairs , and need time to recuperate . 
 I sprained my wrist , but the doctor says it will be fine . 
 The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week . 

Professor , excuse me , but I need to leave early . 
 I am not feeling well . 
 I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack . 
 No , I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there . 
 I live in the dorms across the street , so I ’ ll be OK . 

So , how are you feeling today ? 
 Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ? 
 What time do you usually go to bed ? 
 Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? 
 Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? 

Excuse me , professor . I need to go home now . 
 I just feel funny . 
 I have a terrible headache . 
 I already have some medicine at home if I could just get there . 
 Thank you , but the bus stops right at my house . 

How have you been doing lately ? 
 Is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ? 
 When do you turn in for the night ? 
 Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ? 
 Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ? 

Has everything been OK with you lately ? 
 Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ? 
 How late do you try to go to sleep ? 
 Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? 
 You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . 

I have been having a lot of headaches lately . 
 I have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately . 
 I ’ Ve been under stress , but no more than usual . 
 No , I only sleep a few hours a night . 
 Yes , actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head . 

Hi , I was wondering if I could get my test results from the other day . 
 Is something wrong with me ? 
 Can we talk about it now ? 
 When can I come and see you ? 
 Now I know that something bad is up ! 

Hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day . 
 Does this mean that you have bad news for me ? 
 Can ’ t you just tell me now ? 
 I want to see you right away . 
 I know for sure that something is wrong ! 

I have been getting headaches almost every day lately . 
 I never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them . 
 My mother just passed away last Tuesday . 
 I have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority . 
 No , I haven ’ t hit my head . 

Hi , the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today . 
 I think that this is a bad sign . 
 Why wouldn ’ t you tell me over the phone ? 
 I need to come in right away . 
 You are scaring me ! 

I have had some really horrible headaches lately . 
 I get headaches occasionally , but they have been really bad lately . 
 I am getting ready to take my GRE . 
 It has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache . 
 I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago . 

I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? 
 Alright Steve . Your social security number ? 
 Do you have medical insurance ? 
 Do you have your insurance card with you ? 
 Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . 
 First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible . 
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . 
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . 
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . 
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . 
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
 Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
 I have been feeling pretty good , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . 
 I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . Can you look at that ? 
 Thank you . What will the blood test tell you ? 
 I have been working hard to stay healthy . I hope the tests turn out well . 
 Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? 
 I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . 
 I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . 
 It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? 
 Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? 
 Can you fill out this form then ? 
 That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . 
 Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? 
 I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
 I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? 
 O . K . 
 Yes . 
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . 
 O . K . , thanks , doctor . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 Here , Ma ’ am please get on the stretcher . 
 Calm down , sir . We ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way . 
 How long has she been in labor ? 
 O . K . Are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ? 
 Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready . 
 Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ? 
 OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ? 
 Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ? 
 Thank you . 
 We better see if he ’ s o . k . 
 He ’ s not answering . You ’ d better check his pulse and breathing . 
 Hello ? Yes . Someone has passed out at Connecticut Ave . and 1st St . He isn ’ t breathing and does not have a pulse . Yes . My friend is performing CPR . OK . Thank you . They ’ re sending an ambulance . Here , let me help . 
 I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach ! 
 It ’ s mostly on my right side . Right here ! 
 I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad ! 
 No , not that I remember . 
 I will feel better when I know what the problem is . Thank you for the drugs . 
 Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me ! 
 Right here ! It hurts right here ! 
 I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain . 
 No , and I haven ’ t done anything out of the ordinary . 
 Thank you for helping me . 
 You should go to the dentist . 
 Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
 Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . 
 Good . You feel better after you do . 
 I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! 
 It hurts smack in the middle of my gut ! 
 I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . 
 No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches . 
 I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you . 
 Can you describe your health concern ? 
 Are you in pain ? 
 Would Tuesday or Wednesday be best for you ? 
 I will write you in for that day at 4 
 I will write you in on that doctor ’ s schedule . See you then . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Do you have a fever with that rash ? 
 I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ? 
 Fine , I am putting you down for 9 
 I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you . 
 Are you scheduling a check-up , or are you ill ? 
 Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash ? 
 I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ? 
 I can fit you in on that day at 10 
 You can see the doctor of your choice then , and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time . 
 Why do you need to leave early ? 
 What doesn ’ t feel right ? 
 Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home . 
 Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ? 
 We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions . 
 What day did you have it scheduled for ? 
 What time was it scheduled for ? 
 I see your appointment . What day would you like to switch to ? 
 What time would you like ? 
 Fine , I will pencil that in right now . We will see you then . 
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . 
 Ahhhhhhhh 
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . 
 Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? 
 Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! 
 Thanks doc , bye ! 
 When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ? 
 At what time was that appointment ? 
 I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ? 
 What time would you prefer ? 
 I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule . 
 Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? 
 I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . 
 I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . 
 It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?

 Alright Steve . Your social security number ? 
 Do you have medical insurance ? 
 Do you have your insurance card with you ? 
 Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . 
 First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible . 
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . 
 Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? 
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . 
 Really ? 

Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day . 
 My appointment was on Monday . 
 It was for 10 
 I would prefer next Thursday . 
 I want to come in at 2 

Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . 
 Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! 
 Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . 
 Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . 
 No , I haven't been registered . 
 I'm a medical case . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 The doctor told me to stay about one month . 
 Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back . 

Hello sir , how can I help you ? 
 Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ? 
 Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day . Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol ! 
 Okay , anything else I can get you ? 
 Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system . 
 Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on ” Fun Times Ribbed Condoms ” please ! 
 Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . 
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . 
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . 
 Thanks doc ! 

Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? 
 Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . 
 No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . 

Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? 
 Have you ever had any trauma ? 
 Does the pian become more intense at night ? 
 Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? 
 I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . 
 Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We'll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ? 

Doctor , I feel much better now . Will I be albe to go home some time this week ? 
 Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Should I take some medicine ? 
 It's very kind of you . 

Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . 
 What if it's broken ? 
 What do you mean by a cast ? 

Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes come to see focus properly . 
 Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . 
 All right . 
 Well , this one is worse . 
 I can only read the first three lines . 
 Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? 
 Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . 
 No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? 
 No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous . Now open wider ... now stay , that's over ... 
 Not yet , but it soon will be . Now open again please ... It's out ! Look ! 

I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat . 
 Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge . 
 It has been seasonal during these past three years . 
 Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs . 
 What useful treatment can you offer ? 

What seems to be the problem ? 
 Has this been a problem before ? 
 For how long ? 
 Do you only feel this way when you stomach is empty ? 
 Do you feel nauseous ? 
 Do you have regular bowel movements ? 
 Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much . 
 Not too serious , but it'll take you some time to recover , so you'll need to be patient . 
 I have a laceration on my left forearm . 
 I got hit by a car in an accident . 
 No , not much . 
 Will I need stitches ? 
 No , not really . 
 Thank you , doctor . Bye . 
 I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat . 
 About a day . 
 Ah ... 
 Not so good . 
 Your pulse is weak . 
 Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test . 
 Certainly . I'll do it for you right away . Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock . 
 Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ? 
 Certainly . I recommend this medicine . It's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . And it helps just as much . In fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , I promise . 
 This is for internal use . Two tablets , four times a day . 
 You're welcome . 
 But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! 
 I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
 I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
 A little , but not much . 
 If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled . 
 Let me see ... Perhaps I could fit you in at five thirty . 
 What about tomorrow morning , then ? 
 I guess it can't be helped . 
 All right , then . See you this afternoon . 

Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . 
 Here you are . 
 No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . 
 Thanks a lot . 

Good Morning . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have a registration card ? 
 Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . 
 Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? 
 All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please . 
 Which tooth is it ? 
 Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity . 
 I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . 
 you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . 
 Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment . 
 A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts . 
 One of the back ones . 

Good morning . What seems to be the problem ? 
 I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? 
 Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . 
 Have you been working hard recently ? 
 Good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other symptoms ? 
 Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . 

Oath , I think I broke my leg . 
 Thanks . 
 All right . 
 John Taylor , 32 , May 23 , 1970 . 
 I don ’ t have it . 
 I don ’ t have health insurance . 
 Ohhhh ! 
 I ’ m not sure . I feel hot and cold . 
 I was sick most of the night . 
 Have I got high fever ? 
 Yes , I have . 
 ah . 
 All right , thanks . 
 What shall I do today ? 

What seems to the trouble Mr Brown ? 
 Oh , In what way . 
 Did you lose any weight ? 
 when was the last time you have track up ? 
 Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr.Brown . I ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork . 
 I think you ’ ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ’ ll be sure if you get more rest . 

Good morning , Doctor ! 
 I am not feeling very well . I've got a bad cold . 
 No , but I've got a headache . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ? 
 Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ? 
 Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ? 
 Thank you ! 
 Here , sir . Sit down in this wheel chair . 
 The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . 
 Name , age and date of birth , please ? 
 Health insurance company and policy No ? 
 What ? 
 Well , this is going to be a very expensive broken leg , Mr . Taylor . 

Hello , Doctor . 
 It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . 
 About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . 
 Pretty good , I'd say . 
 No , doctor . I've actually put on two pounds . 
 Well , doctor ? 
 What examinations ? 

Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . 
 OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . 
 Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . 
 I don't have time to talk to her now . 
 Thank you . 
 We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained . 
 Well . I hope there won't be such things . 

How about overtime work ? 
 Do you like regular work ? 

Good morning . This is Apple Corporation . May I speak to Ballam ? 
 I ’ m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer . 
 Your starting salary is 3 , 000 yuan a month , but if you work well we will put you on our regular staff after six months time and your salary will be raised to 5,000 yuan a month . 
 What is the lowest salary you may consider ? 
 That ’ s all right . We will pay you 4 , 000 yuan a month for supporting your family . Would you like to start on next Monday ? 

I'm Mary Kell . May I ask your name ? 
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . 
 What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? 
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? 
 Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? 
 All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let ’ s go to his office . 
 I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . 
 I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . 
 I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . 
 Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? 
 What if it exceeds the capacity ? 

Hello , Westhaven Company . 
 This is Michael Richard speaking . Who is calling ? 
 You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ? 
 We have made the decision to hire you . 
 I will , thank you for calling . 
 I have been a salesman . 

Hello , Could you please connect me to Mr . Cook's office ? It is on Line Three . 
 Oh . Then I don't know what his number is . Can you check it for me ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Thank you . You helped me a lot . 

Well , Miss Liu , I've enjoyed talking with you . Thank you for your interest in this job . 
 We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ? 
 Good luck to you , good-bye . 

Can I talk to you for a moment , manager ? 
 I've decided to leave . 
 I've worked here for two years . And I want to do something different . 
 I want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language . 
 Thank you , manager . 
 That's terrible . 
 Sorry , Tom , can you say that last bit again please ? We didn ’ t get that . 
 Sorry Tom , We're having problems hearing you here . It ’ s a bit hissy . Can you hear us ? 
 Hello ? 
 Tom , if you can hear me , I think we ’ Ve lost you . There ’ s a problem with the line . Let ’ s try again . We ’ ll call you . 

We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ? 
 What is your greatest weakness ? 
 What is the greatest disappointment in your life ? 
 Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work , if you are hired ? 

What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? 
 What commission terms can you offer ? 
 Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? 
 Then I'll accept it with thanks . 
 Is that difficult ? 
 That's all right . What can I do ? 
 Well . I can do it . And then ? 
 Who will pay for these things ? 
 OK . I will go in no time . 
 What are the allowances ? 
 Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ? 
 Will our company have some recreational activities ? 

Now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . Please sit down . 
 B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ? 
 Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . 

Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ? 
 Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are . 
 200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample . 
 Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . 
 Yes , five to six weeks . 
 Eight weeks ? We can wait that long . 
 Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? 
 That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose . 
 That's right . 
 As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday . 

These goods can be broken very easily , so we would be thankful if you would be sure to use durable packing materials . 
 Good . Can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ? 
 Do you always put a quality mark on each container ? For this shipment it is crucial to us that you do . 
 Thanks . This shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups . 
 Cartons . Is that okay ? 
 Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . 
 Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . 
 We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . 
 Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . 
 Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . 
 So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? 
 Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . 
 That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? 
 Well , take care of yourself . And hope you will be better as soon as possible . 
 I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . 
 I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . 
 I don't think we can make it . 
 By the middle of October . 
 Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery . 
 Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do . 

Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form . 
 Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . 
 Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . 

Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . 
 Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . 
 Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . 
 This afternoon . 
 We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . 
 Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . 
 And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . 

David , how is your interview ? 
 Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . 
 Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . 
 Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . 

Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . 
 That's right . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 What can I do next ? 
 Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? 

How much tea are you going to order ? 
 When do you want to deliver the goods ? 
 I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . 
 Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? 
 Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . 

How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? 
 OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . 
 Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . 
 But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . 
 In what way can we solve the problem ? 
 Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . 
 Well , we accept your suggestion . 
 It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . 
 All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . 
 Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . 
 So do I . 
 What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? 
 No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? 
 And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . 
 That's great . 
 Well , we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays . Our factories will be closed for another week . 
 No problem . Once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . 
 That will be fine . And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order . 
 Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . 
 We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . 
 We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . 

You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . 
 Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . 
 Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . 
 Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . 
 First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here . 
 Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? 
 Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? 
 That's exactly my understanding . 

Steven , have a rest . Could you have a talk with me ? 
 Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? 
 Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you . 

Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? 
 As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . 
 We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . 
 I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . 

Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here . 
 OK . 
 Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . 
 OK . Thank you very much . 

I have read your resume.What is your last job ? 
 Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ? 
 Great ! Could you tell me your educational background ? 
 Why are you willing to work for our company ? 
 OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days . 

My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . 
 Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . 
 That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . 

In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? 
 How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? 
 Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . 

Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ? 
 The holiday is coming so we need to finish our task . 
 Yes . The contract must be kept . 
 Did he say why ? 
 Don't worry . I will tell him about that . 
 Thank you for that . And I will double your pay . 
 Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? 
 I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? 
 So how do you intend to do that ? 
 May I interrupt you for a moment ? 
 How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? 
 I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? 

Hello , Pineapple Computer Company . This is Janice Shaw , the secretary of Nova . May I ask who is calling ? 
 I feel so sorry that Nova has gone on her business trip . 
 Maybe next weekend . She only mentioned this before she left . 
 Wait a minute . I have to leave a memo here . Anything else ? 
 Dan , don't worry . I will tell her everything as soon as she comes back . 
 Next week there will be a meeting with the manager of USE Company ; this is an important opportunity for our company to have a new relationship with a new partner . So , I want you to prepare an instruction book with detailed introduction of our products . This introduction will be presented in the meeting . 
 Remember to add an agenda for this meeting and show our warm welcome to them . 
 Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly . 
 A , do your best , it's very important . 

We should know by next month whom to hire . If your application is successful , we'll notify you by mail . 
 We'll give you our decision in 7 days . 
 Please send the next candidate in on your way out . 

Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ? 
 Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet . 
 I am sure that document was filed . 
 Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . 

Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ? 
 Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 
 Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? 
 Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . 

Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company . 
 I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person . 
 We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . 
 We surely believe you . 
 I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . 
 OK . 
 I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration . 

Janice , the president of our company , Mr Smith , will invite two programmers to give us a lecture this afternoon . Are all the members notified ? 
 Is the room ready for the lecture now ? 
 Excellent . How about the microphone and speaker ? 
 Write up the official notice in duplicate . Do not forget to put name cards and pens on the tables for our guests . 
 How would you seat them ? 
 Well , after the half of the meeting , there will be an interval for rest and refreshment . 
 Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company . 
 But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . 
 What's the meeting for ? 
 I will be there after 20 minutes . 
 Thank you . I never imagine that would happen . 
 Thank you . But I am not sure whether the manager is settling for it . She asked me to go to her office . 
 I feel nervous when I face Nova . 
 You know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved . 
 I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill in that kind of place . 

I'm afraid it's bad news for you . You haven't got the position . 
 I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry . 
 He's the only one of the several to decide this . 
 I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result . Besides , I don't think the position is the best for you . 
 Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday . 
 Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please . 
 Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? 
 Sorry , could you repeat that please ? 
 Let me read that back to you , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can . 
 Anything else ? 
 Bye . 
 Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise . 
 So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . 
 You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . 
 Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . 
 Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much . 
 As you please . I ’ m ready . 
 I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement . 
 Well , the company has some financial problems . People there are all thinking of quitting . 
 One week after I have submitted my resignation paper . 
 Thank you , sir . 
 I ’ m not so satisfied with it . 
 I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job . 
 One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English . That's just the job that I have been looking for 
 I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied . 
 Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation . 
 Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough . 
 Yes , I applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed . 
 This one , of course . Your company is my first choice . I want to work for you . 
 Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . 
 The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet . 
 And each file should be named clearly , either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals . 
 A card index is very important in the filing system . It is a most helpful friend to a secretary , so it must be kept handy and up to date . 

I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate . 
 What did you take as your major in college ? 
 What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ? 
 All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ? 
 Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things . 

Madam , is everything set up for your trip ? 
 You will be busier , right ? 
 That will be gorgeous ! 
 Yes , Madam . 
 Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . 
 When can I contact you about your final decision ? 
 Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning . 
 The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens . 

Welcome to China , Mr . Smith . 
 I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats . 
 Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . 
 What's the proposal ? 
 Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . 

Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ? 
 No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . 
 OK . I ’ m 24 this year . I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology . 
 Of course . I ’ Ve been working as an office clerk in the Textile Company since my graduation . I do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on . 
 To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work . 
 Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility . 
 She must be an honest person . 
 She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative . 
 Well , no . But I took related courses . I can gain experience quickly . I ’ m sure I can do the job well . 
 Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company . 
 That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company . 

Thank you for your interest in this job . You'll be hearing from us . Send the next applicant in on your way out , please . 
 It has been pleasant talking with you . 
 May I call you at your home about our final decision ? 
 We'll get in touch with you by next Wednesday . Thank you for your interest in this job . 

: How are you , Mr . Ding ? I ’ m John Brown . 
 Please have a seat . I know our employment officer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I ’ d like to go over the main details again before signing the contract . First , you ’ ll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . No probation is involved . 
 You ’ ll be covered by our medical plan while on duty . Since you ’ ll be middle-anagement , you , re expected to be available up to one hour past normal working hours . Any approved overtime that will be paid at time , which you can take as salary or time off . 
 A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 Yes it is , but you ’ ll have to discuss the details with your manager . 

How can I help you , sir ? 
 Sorry , could you tell me your name ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? 
 She will be back soon . 
 Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate . 
 It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group . 
 Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know . 

Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ? 
 En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . 
 Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon . 
 I really want to stay a little longer , but I still have a meeting to attend . All in all , I am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome . Thank you for the trouble you have taken . 
 During my trip here , I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . I can feel and sense the potential of your company . And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful . 
 Of course , I will . 
 Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up ! 
 Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better . 

Is your application successful ? 
 Where on earth will you work in ? 
 How long will you work a day ? 
 That ’ s rather hard . 
 How will you get your pay ? 
 What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ? 
 Is there a union ? 
 So you must consider dearly before you go to work . 

I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . 
 About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . 
 Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . 
 Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . 
 Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . 
 Yes , I'd like to make a reservation for eight tonight . 
 At 7:30 pm . And I would like to sit in the non-smoking area . 
 The private room , please . 
 It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company . 

Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview . 
 Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . 
 Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . 
 Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . 
 I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company . 
 Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? 

Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement . 
 Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . 
 Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . 
 Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily . 

Fred , have you made the plan for April 28th ? 
 You go ! 
 Is there anything after the meeting ? In that case , would you add one plan ? I want to visit our guest Mr . Ross after the meeting . Can you arrange it for me ? 
 My present pay is RIB 3 , 000 yuan each month . 
 What is important to me is the job and the people who I will be working with , so regarding salary , I leave it to you and I am sure that you will make me a fair offer . 
 Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it . 
 To whom should I report ? 
 What are the benefits ? 
 I would like to know if there would be any opportunity to work abroad in the future ? 
 Thank you . Then I think it's time for us to sign a letter of intent . 

The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . Can you draw up a schedule for them ? If they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made . 
 They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . Besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing . 
 They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . 
 They will stay for two days . Try to work out an efficient schedule . 
 Which terms ? 
 Good . I will add this to the contract . 
 Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? 
 Well , we have agreed on all the major points . 
 Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . 
 Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . 
 I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ? 

We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? 
 Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? 
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? 
 Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? 
 Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . 
 Sounds good . 
 Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ? 
 Can you tell me the specialty of your computer board ? 
 What's the memory capacity of the computer ? 
 Can you give me a wholesale list ? 
 Is the price negotiable ? 

Do you work well under pressure ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 How soon can you begin working for us ? 

May I see the manager of your office ? 
 Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company . I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . 
 We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . 
 As you know , we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications . 
 Two months at most . 
 Yes , of course , here you are . The prices are subject to our confirmation . 
 Hello , John . 
 How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ? 
 What is it ? 
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port . 
 Our goods are well-examined before shipment . I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route . 
 We will check with the parties concerned right away . 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 It ’ s quite convenient . 
 OK . Thank you very much . 
 I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting . 
 I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . 
 Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . 
 Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . 
 I haven ’ t been involved in international business , so I don ’ t have any experience . 
 Honest , hardworking and responsible . 
 No , I haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but I am sure he will understand . 
 I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . 
 Is that true ? 
 If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . 
 I have many hobbies , I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to pop songs . 
 I think I am extroverted . 
 Again ? 
 Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . 

David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ? 
 So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . 
 As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . 
 To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . 
 No , certainly not . 
 We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . 
 I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . 
 We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . 
 I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . 
 Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . 

Have you finished that report yet ? 
 How much time do you need ? 

Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? 
 They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working . 
 So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office . 
 Thank you . I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users . 
 I am flattered . But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office . 
 I feel nervous when I face her . She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time . 
 It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation . 
 I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place . 

I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods . 
 I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that . 
 Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? 
 But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? 
 Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . 
 Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . 
 If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . 
 The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . 
 I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . 
 It is so hard to deal with . 
 This price is the best we can make . 
 Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? 
 Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity . 
 In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set . 
 We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive . 
 Letter of credit at sight . 
 Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us . 
 OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion . 
 We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days . 
 You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . 
 But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . 
 Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? 
 Impossible . How about 5 % off ? 

Well , let's have your firm order . 
 Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ? 
 I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . 
 It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . 
 Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . 
 We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B . 
 It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years . 
 They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment . 
 That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation . 
 Thank you again ! 
 OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? 
 All right . 
 I've had enough . 
 Are you having a meeting ? 
 I understand . 
 I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights . What should we do firstly ? 
 Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number . 
 We can also consult some from these volunteers . 
 Should we put our samples on this table ? 

Good morning , sir ! Please know some about our latest products . 
 They are our products . Please come in and have a look . This is the catalogue for our products . 
 Of course , here you are . 
 Would you sit down and write down your name and address here ? 
 This is the latest design for our products . The design of I-series keeps the fashion in a close way . The sales volume of the new product is about 50,000 per month . And we received many orders from many clothes companies . New functions and attractive outlook are the key points for our products . 
 Yes , I need to talk to him . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi Marry , this is Tom . 
 I need to see if we can get together today . 
 No , tell him I'm tied up . 
 Tell him to call me tomorrow morning . 
 Thank you . 
 Linda , this is David Wang . 
 I need to talk with Marry . 
 Thanks . 
 Is this Susan ? 
 Oh well , do you know if the Susan Li is available ? 

John Li's Office , this is Jenny , may I help you ? 
 Yes , but let me check if he's available . 

Beauties Picture , how may I help you ? 
 He's out of his office . 

Dan More's Office , how may I help you ? 
 May I tell him who's calling ? 
 Just a minute please , Mr . White . 

Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? 
 Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . 
 Certainly ! 

Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue . 
 I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming . 

Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage . 
 We'd like you to come to work for us . 
 I see . 
 Please call us if you change your mind . 

OK , folks , let's get to work . We need to come up with some ideas for the new essentials perfume campaign . This is a really big contract and we are under a lot of pressure here to impress the client . 
 The reason I have called this meeting is to review a proposal we have received from our international division in Hong Kong . The agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by Mr . Black . Second , an analysis by Ms . Nielson . Finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal . 
 Yes ? 
 What position ? 
 How much does it pay ? 
 I'm sorry but my bottom figure is $ 36,000 . 
 Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . 
 Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? 
 Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? 

What are you doing , Janice ? 
 Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? 
 You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? 
 So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . 
 Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? 
 How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ? 

Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? 
 I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . 
 I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? 

May I speak to Marry ? 
 Ok , I'll try her back then . 

OK ! Let's get down to business now . 
 As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . 
 I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . 
 Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . 
 What kind of media do you recommend ? 
 Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . 

You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years . How do you like the job ? 
 If I may ask , are you happy with your salary ? 
 Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ? 
 What is your salary expectation for this position ? 

Let's get down to business . 
 Yes . I have . I'm interested in your underwear . If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon . 
 What's your price ? 
 That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay . 
 I offer you 110 yuan . 
 All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? 
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . 

What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 What makes you angry ? 

How was your interview ? 
 What did you say ? 
 Did he want to know the reasons ? 
 That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ? 
 Wish you good luck ! 

Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . 
 I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . 
 We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . 
 I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? 
 Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . 
 I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . 

What are your personal weaknesses ? 
 Are you more of a leader or a follower ? 
 Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 
 Are you available for travel ? 

Hi , Tom ! This is Marry with Hans furniture store . 
 I just wanted to let you to know that we had decided to offer the sales position to someone else . 
 We considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience . 
 I'm sure you are . 

Why have you stopped production ? 
 OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ? 
 Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve . 
 Speaking . 
 All right . What time are you coming ? 
 Can we make it 11:30 ? A customer will come to the office at 11 . 
 Great . I'll see you on the 7th . 
 Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . 
 That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 

I think I've got a virus on my computer . Do you know how to get rid of it ? I haven't had one before . 
 Have you got the number ? I'll call them right now . 
 Hello , this is Miller . I'm calling about the appointment with Mr . Zhang for this afternoon . Something's just come up , I'm afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled , I'm very sorry about the change . 
 You're very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon , Um ... you see , I've made an appointment with Mr . Comet for tomorrow afternoon . In order to meet Mr . Zhang , I have to cancel the appointment with Mr . Comet , I'm afraid . 
 I understand . When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? 
 Yes , that's quite all right for me . 
 Yes , Mary ? 
 Are you telling me you're not going to meet with me ? 
 Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice . 
 OK , I'll go to your office at that time . 
 Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 . 
 About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan . 

Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ? 
 Let me check . It's 3.80 m . 
 That's a good point . I'll make a note to increase it to 4.80 to make sure we can accept the new containers . 
 Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay . 
 The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again . 

Who's in charge of the construction project ? 
 I can ’ t I'm afraid . I've got another meeting scheduled for 2:30 p . m . 
 Park in the visitors ' car park in front of the factory and then go to the gatehouse . It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park . The Security people will sign you in and give you a visitor's badge . My assistant will come down to meet you . 

We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years . 
 Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . 
 Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . 
 We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . 
 No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York . 
 We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation . 
 Do you have many different suppliers ? 

Hi Steve . What do you think of the new supplier ? 
 That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ? 

How do you choose which companies to work with ? 

What do you do ? 

I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . 
 Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? 

What's wrong , Lisa ? You keep pacing back and forth . 
 Don't worry . You'll do fine . 
 Yes , what is up ? 
 Sure . 
 Will I be getting any help ? 

Mark , you really did a good job . 
 You must have spent much time on the project . 
 Your project made much profit for the company . And the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . 

What do you know about our company ? 
 Very good . If you enter this company , what department would you like to work in ? 
 OK . Oh , how much do you make at your current job , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? 
 Well , the starting salary for a clerk in our company is 2,500 yuan monthly and after three months he would get a raise if his work is satisfactory . 
 Sure , we provide semi-annual bonus , a small bonus at Spring Festival , four weeks paid vacation a year . 
 We can buy that for you . 

This computer isn't working properly . 
 We need to get it fixed soon . 
 Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ? 
 Oh , what's wrong with you ? 
 Well , you sound ill over the phone . 
 That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough . 
 Goodbye , Lucy . 
 Yes . Quite good . Perhaps you're very interested in the social benefits . 
 Really ? We would like to start you off at 2,000 yuan a month , excluding bonus and overtime pay . 
 Well , we'll supply you with an apartment of a bedroom and a living room . 
 Yes , in our company , the women have a two-week vacation a year , besides this , if you are a married woman , maternity leave for some months is permitted . 
 Yes , you have a paid month holiday every year . 
 Well , we are only responsible for the retirement pension . About the unemployment compensation , this will be given by the government . 

Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work . 
 I guess I'll have to buy a new alarm clock . 
 Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . 
 I'm positive , Ms . Chen . 
 I'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . I should not , of course , make a change for less . Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ? 
 You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience . 
 What are they ? 
 But I have my own car and my own house . 
 Thank you very much . 

Why do you want to join us ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 What salary do you get for your present position ? 
 What starting salary would you expect here ? 
 No problem , we pay 3,000 RIB per month . Plus a 20 % commission on all , a company car and other benefits . All travelling expenses will be reimbursed by the company . Do you have any other questions ? 

How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? 
 Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ? 

This will be your office here . 
 We try to get everyone in the upper management team a nice office . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Yes , we have a coffee machine and some other beverages in the break room . 
 It's just down the hall , the fourth door on your right . 
 You can always call me if you need anything and I will get it for you . 

What sort of salary did you get at your previous job ? 
 I see . I am sure we can offer you $ 3 , 500 at the beginning . Would that be satisfactory ? 
 Good . We also have health insurance , bonus and paid vacation . When can you begin to work ? 
 Good . Please come in on Monday . Working hours are from eight to four-thirty . Lunch is fifty-five minutes . 

Julia , I would like to have a word with you . Have a seat . 
 According to your performance , I decided to give you a salary increase . From next month , there will be a 2,000 yuan raise to your salary . Although your first raise might not sound considerable , the company believes that with your ability , sooner or later you'll get a better raise . 
 I think you deserved this . 

Are you paid on a commission or salary basis now ? 
 What's your monthly salary ? 
 How much do you hope to get a month here ? 
 If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ? 

We need someone rather quickly , the sooner the better . 
 Well , of course depends somewhat on experience , background and that sort of thing . What are your currently earning ? 
 I see . Including bonus ? 
 What starting salary would you expect here ? 

The client you're meeting tomorrow likes to ask a lot of questions , so you have to be well prepared . 

My name is Sue . How do you do , Mr . Black ? 
 Thank you , sir . 
 Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
 Good . Anything else ? 
 Thank you , sir . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity . 
 Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance . 
 Yes . My house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ? 
 That ’ s great . If you don ’ t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ? 
 Oh , just one more thing , could you give me some idea about holidays ? 
 No problem . 
 OK . 
 Yes , you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Clark . And this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants . 
 Certainly . 
 How big , Alice ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 4 nights . 
 All right , Alice . But this is the last time . I also have a lot of work to do . 

Have you ever served in any international trading company ? 
 Then why did you leave ? 
 What have you learnt from this short experience ? 

Excuse me , Mr . Li . I have something to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It's about the overtime you've asked me to put in . 
 I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him . 

Tell me about how you work here . 

I'm going to quit this job . It's way too stressful . 
 Yeah , I'm in the office till 10 every night . I can't take it anymore . The pay just isn't worth it . 
 I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business . 
 Yes . I worked in a small machinery factory . My work was very simple and there was not much work to do . 
 No , I thought it was too dull . I'm capable of more responsibilities , so I decided to change my job . 
 Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement . Your company is an important international company . Working for it , I believe it can improve my abilities . 
 Oh , the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world . It was founded in the United States in 1980 . I know that the company has made good use of advanced technology . 
 I do a forty-hour week . I ’ m on flexi-time . I usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4 
 Four - plus public holidays . I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year . 
 Yes , if we're busy . I'm paid double-time if I work at weekends . 
 We have a three-shift system - that's three eight-hour shifts each weekday . We're shut at weekends . This week I'm on the early shift . 
 Yes , sometimes . I don't like working nights I have problems sleeping during the day . 
 Glad to meet you again , Mrs Hao . You are so kind . 
 Oh , it's a real Chinese meal . When in Rome , do as the Romans do . I'd take the chopsticks . 
 Beer , please . Oh , there are so many dishes . 
 Let's hope for good cooperation between us . 
 I work for a large multinational company called DAK Group . We have five main area of business - construction , heavy industry , shipbuilding , motor vehicles and telecommunications . 
 The motor vehicles division . I work in our Belgian factory . We manufacture components for our car production plants in Europe . 
 In Seoul . But the company has operations in over fifty countries and thirty factories all over the world . 
 Of course not . 
 Yes . I gave her my resignation a few days ago . 
 Yes , I think she will . 
 Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay . 
 Yes . It's a Korea company and it was built in Beijing five years ago . 
 I get along pretty well with most of them . 
 I think the key point is to be considerate of your co-workers ' feelings and needs and make a good working environment . 

Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ? 
 I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . 
 Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . 
 Whatever we said , we must be more careful . 

What does your company do exactly ? 
 And who do you sell to ? 

What position have you held before ? 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Why do you leave your present company ? 
 Why did you pick this organization ? 
 What made you decide to join our company ? 

Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Excuse me , sir , but are you Mr . Richard of World Trading Company ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute . 
 Would you like something to drink , sir ? Do you prefer coffee or tea ? 
 Here you are , Mr . Richard . This is the cream and this is the sugar . If there ’ s anything else you ’ d like , please don ’ t hesitate to tell me . 

Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Charles , the manager , please . 
 No . I haven't , but I'll take only a few minutes of his time . 
 Yes . My name is Lin Tao , the director of Guangzhou Computer Corporation . 
 ( 2 minutes later ) Mr . Lin , Mr . Charles can see you now . This way , please . 
 We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . 
 Yes , it is really hard . But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally . When you work , you can accumulate a lot of experience . Besides , you need to learn a lot of things while you are working . 
 But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . 
 You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . 
 We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . 
 It was just over two million euros last year . 
 Yes , I suppose we must . I have enjoyed all these days that you have spent with me , and I'll always remember them . I've learned a lot from you . Thank you for all your kindness . 
 I hope so , too . 
 I'm really glad to hear that 
 Good-bye , Mr White . A happy journey home , and hope to see you again soon . 
 For over forty years . The original company Davies Engineering - was founded in 1960 by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester . They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds . 
 In 1997 - when it was bought by a German company . They set up two more business in the UK . 
 International Air Braking Systems . 
 All right . Please read it to me . 
 Very good . 
 Oh , that's great . 
 Oh , great ! Let's discuss it together . Now , when am I off then ? 
 What time exactly ? 
 Oh , am I seeing Mr . Li ? 
 I've got a schedule ! 

When we get paid for this assignment , you get US $ 2 , TOO , and I get US $ 3,000 . 
 Okay , okay , we'll split it 50/50 . 
 Sorry , I'm busy . Why don't you ask Alice ? 

Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ? 

Are you busy tomorrow morning ? 
 Someone has to pick up the boss at the airport . 

How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ? 
 I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? 

Bad news , I'm afraid . Our supplier has gone bust . The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice . We also need to arrange transport to the factory . 

Why have you changed your job so frequently ? 

Today I want to invite you to talk about insurance you ’ re interested in . 
 Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek . 
 Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy . 
 Yes . 
 I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four . 
 Yes , thank you very much . In addition , do you have the marketing proposal ready ? 

Do you have any questions ? 
 Yes , after you ’ Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation 
 That's the company policy . 
 Yes . That's the company policy . 

Do you have some questions ? 
 If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends . 
 Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? 

This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? 
 Don't worry . These dates are only targets . 
 I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . 
 I find it interesting . 
 I go to the office by bus every day . 
 My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . 
 No , often my boss requires overtime work . 
 5,000 yuan a month . 
 I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . 
 Yes , I do . 
 As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity . 
 Just as you advertised in the newspaper . 
 Yes , what's more , your company is one of the largest and best trading companies in this line of business . 
 Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 . 
 Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ? 
 Why ? 

Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems . 
 Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems . 
 Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . 
 Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . 
 How long will the system be down for ? 
 That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side . 
 Three . 
 I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation . 
 I must be there no later than 9:00 . 
 I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . 
 No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . 
 I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . 
 That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . 
 Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . 
 Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . 

I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? 
 So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? 

We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs . We have separate areas for welding , grinding and sawing . 
 Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . 
 It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . 
 No , I think I didn't like your method . 

Can you help me ? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up . 
 Thanks for your help . 

Where can I find a spare hose for the pump ? 
 25 mm diameter . 
 Thanks . Have you got any light bulbs ? 
 Oh yes , some wire cutters . 
 Just one pair . 

I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? 

Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? 
 Never mind . I'll do it . 
 That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory . 
 When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder . 
 Of course , where do you want me to stand ? 
 I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? 
 Well , it's about 65 cm at the moment . Could we increase it by about a third ? 

Has my package arrived ? 
 It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal . 

OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment . 
 They're setting up the machine for a new run . 
 About twenty minutes . 
 That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . 
 Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . 
 Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ? 
 What does the unit consist of ? 

Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . 

OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . 
 About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . 
 If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . 
 Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . 
 Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . 
 They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . 
 Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . 
 Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . 
 We try to recycle as much as we can . 
 We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . 
 Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill 
 Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . 
 Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . 
 We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . 
 Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , please ? 
 This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ? 
 Yes , Please tell him I called and ask him to return my call as soon as possible . It's about the PPT contract . 

Good morning . May I help you ? 
 He's not in , I'm afraid . 
 I am sorry , I don't know . 
 Certainly . 
 They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? 
 Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . 
 You're on . 
 I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . 
 Good morning ! 
 I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here . 
 That's very kind of you , but I can do without a rest . I have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I believe I will . 
 Hello . This is Jones . I'd like to speak to Mr . Chen . 
 I'd like to discuss the new order with you . Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday ? 
 That's a pity . Does Friday suit you ? 
 Is 12 o'clock convenient for you ? 

Excuse me , but are you Mr . Smith from Britain ? 
 I'm from Textile Import and Export Corporation . I've come to meet you . My name is Zhang Yong . 
 How do you do , Mr . Smith ? Let me help you with your luggage . 
 Did you have a good trip ? 
 Anyhow , it's a long way to China , isn't it ? And I think you must be very tired . 
 I wish you a pleasant stay here . 
 Now , Mr . Smith , if all is ready , we'd better start for the hotel . 
 This way , please . Our car is waiting over there . 
 Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting . 
 The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . 
 Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . 
 Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . 
 No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . 
 Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . 
 First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . 
 All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . 
 Of course , she should take minutes . 
 After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . 

Miss Sun , could you please type this report for me ? 
 Could you please double space it so I can make corrections ? 
 No . This afternoon will be fine . 
 Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . 
 Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . 
 For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? 
 Yes , quite free until noon . 
 Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . 

Mr . Li , the report has been finished . 
 You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? 
 OK , I'll do it right now . 
 Yes , I get it . 

Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? 
 Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon . 
 Please double space it and print it out on the laser printer so I can read it easily . 
 Please type it in a formal style . 
 No , thanks . 
 Sit down here - don't put any pressure on it . I'd better call the company doctor . 
 We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider . 
 We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . 
 We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . 
 I cut it on that blade . 

What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? 

Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . 
 Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? 

Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? 
 What do you recycle in your plant ? 
 How is plastic recycled , then ? 
 Is that the method you use here ? 
 How do you do that ? 

Caroline Menzies speaking . 
 I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? 
 Can I take a message , Mr Laing ? 
 Certainly . Does she have your number ? 
 01705 ... 
 455623 . 
 OK . I'll make sure she gets the message . 

Rebecca Johnson speaking . 
 Just a moment ... I'm afraid there's nobody there right now . Could I take a message ? 
 Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ... 
 Fine , I've got that . And your company is ... 
 Could you spell that , please ? 
 Thank you . And the message ? 
 Have you got the number there ? 
 856674 . 
 OK , I'll get someone to phone you first thing in the morning . 

Marriott Street . 
 M , A , double R , I , O , double T . 

Fastback Travel . How can I help you ? 
 He's on holiday for the week , I'm afraid . Can I help ? 
 Sure . 
 You'd better spell that ! 
 Right , I think I've got that . OK , what's the message ? 
 OK , will do . Bye . 

It's the Cygnet Trust . 
 Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T . 

This is our main service area . We do all the routine services here and have two full-time mechanics . 
 They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . 
 Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . 
 Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ? 
 ( beep ) This is Miriam Lavalle – that's spelt L , A , V , A , L , L , E . It's about an appointment I made with Simon Meredith . I'm afraid I'm going to have to change it . Can you call me ? The number is 01563 566 770 . Thank you . 
 I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . 

How often do you service the pump ? 
 How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? 

What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? 

John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? 

What's wrong ? 
 Have you checked the fuse box ? 
 There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip . Check the settings on the trip-switch . If you can't fix it yourself , call in an electrician . 
 The toner has run out and there's none in the stationery cupboard . 

What ’ s happened ? Is there a problem ? 
 You'll have to dismantle the unit and lubricate the bearings . Do it as quickly as you can but make sure you top up the oil before you start the motor up again . 
 To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time . 
 Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here . 
 Yes , I did . I have them here . 
 Thank you very much . This should only take me a few minutes . 
 I knew everything would work out for you ! 
 Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ? 
 Do you know what you will be doing yet ? 
 You're so good with people . I think they will like you ! 
 You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous . 
 OK , OK ! 
 Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . 
 Give me a break , Mr Yang . 

Hello ! You're welcome to Guangzhou Fair . 
 Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . 
 Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . 
 Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ? 

Good morning , sir , can I help you ? 
 I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? 
 I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . 
 Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? 
 I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . 

We are interested in some precision machine tools . We have some inquires on hand . 
 Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ? 
 I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies . 
 Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff . 
 OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list . 

Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . 
 Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . 
 I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . 

You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company . 
 The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . 
 In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . 
 Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know . 
 Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do . 
 Don't worry . We can always change our careers , when we are unsatisfied with them . 
 For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply . 
 Thanks . I'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow . 
 You'll find our prices very favorable . 
 Either can be done , though we usually quote on CIF basis . 
 Certainly . We can work them out for you . 
 Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . 
 If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . 
 This is our counter-offer . 
 So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market . 
 Agreed . 
 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
 I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . 
 I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? 
 Is that all ? 
 I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . 
 I've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . 
 Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . 
 Fine . As well , would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . 
 One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . 
 We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . 
 Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . 
 I still have no idea what to do now . 
 I could not agree with you more . But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume . 
 Sounds good . I will do it in a jiffy . OK ! Let's put our heads together . 
 Terrific ! 
 I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call . 
 Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ? 
 But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . 
 All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave . 
 It's all or nothing . 
 Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? 
 OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . 
 Have you tried pressing the Escape key ? 
 OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time . 
 You might lose the file you were working on , but don't worry , the help desk can restore it . When did you last take a backup ? 
 Are you sure you're using the right program ? 
 That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file . 
 I think the file is too big . You'll need to expand your memory . First , close down all the files you have open , and then ... 
 Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory . 
 It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them . 
 Have you checked your connection settings ? 
 Yes , there have been a few problems recently . Why don't you call the IT department ? 
 Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . 
 Yes , don't use the lifts . We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . 
 Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . 
 If you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . Make sure you use the right extinguisher . They are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire . 
 I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do . 
 It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . 
 Of course . I will write a report about this post-trip , and then you'd better type it at the moment , OK ? 
 ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ? 
 Nothing . I just tell you take care of it when you type , especially the address and telephone number of those new guests . You should make sure that it's no mistaken . 
 Ha , I know you are great secretary . 

What's your plan for your future ? 
 Have you had any previous experience ? 
 Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? 
 In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary . 
 Office hours are nine to five-thirty . One hour for lunch . Do you have any questions ? 
 We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise . 
 I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ? 
 All right . Good-bye . 

Welcome to our company , My name is Jon Dahl Green . I'm in charge of the export department . Let me give you my business card . 
 How was your flight ? 
 Here's your schedule . After this meeting , we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . And you'll be having dinner with our director . 
 Of course . I've arranged it at 10 0 ' clock tomorrow morning . 
 Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ? 
 I'm very glad to hear that . 
 The unit price is $ 12.50 . 
 I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 . 
 Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith . 
 Of course . 
 Adaptability and sense of humor . 
 ( Pause a few seconds ) They say Mr . Chen is an honest , hardworking and responsible man who deeply cares for his family and friends . 
 Honest , flexible and easy-going . 
 I feel that learning how to motivate people and to work together as a team will be the major goal of my leadership . 
 Silence is golden . Just don't say anything ; otherwise the situation could become worse . I do , however , accept constructive criticism . 
 Sometimes , the narrow-minded people make me frustrated . 
 I will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get my points across . 
 How long would you like to stay with this company ? 

What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 What kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 What kind of people do you find difficult to work with ? 

Could you arrange an appointment with Mr . Smith ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 

We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out . 
 The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent . 
 Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards . 
 The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control . 
 I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . 

What did you exactly do there ? 
 What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ? 

Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? 
 You can knock off another 2 % for that . 
 Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop . 
 I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . 
 Good morning . Could I speak to someone in the sales department , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company . 
 I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal . That is very important . 
 I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the food market in China . 
 They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . 
 I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . 
 I preferred working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can ’ t do without them . 
 Yes , I am sure I can . 
 Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 Yes , I think I can in ordinary circumstances . 
 Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I got a high score on TOEFL . I majored in English in college . 
 Only English . 
 I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials . I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator . 
 I have received an oral English training and I can communicate with others fluently . 
 Yes , I did . I got 600 in TOEFL and 2 , 300 in GRE . 
 I started to learn English when I was in primary school . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm . 
 I am afraid not . I haven't worked in an American company so far . 
 The first is accounting entity , and the second is going concern . The third is measuring unit . The fourth is accounting period , and the fifth is objectivity . 
 We could make it lower for you . What's your counter-offer ? 
 If you order in large lots , we'll accept the price . 
 All right , as a token of friendship , we accept your counter-offer . 

Our offer is RIB 300 per tape-recorder , F . O . B . Tianjin . 
 That's the best price we can offer . 
 We can give you a discount if you order for immediate shipment . 
 How to adjust ? 
 Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . 
 Yes , sometimes the differences are great . 
 We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . 
 How about this product selling from last month on ? 
 Am . Well , can I have a try of the sample free of charge ? 
 Thank you . We'll order once we try the sample . 
 OK . 
 Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . 
 Many exporters speak French and German as well . 
 Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . 
 Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . 

Do you know what exporters consider ? 
 Could you talk about it in detail ? 
 I understand . Thank you . 
 We are very glad to hear that . We are sure that there will be a bigger market for our products in this country . 
 We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ? 

I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters . 
 Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly . 
 Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ? 
 Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Thanks , Mr . Liang . 
 Really ? I am too happy . 
 Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task . 
 Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future . 
 A contract is an agreement which is binding on both parties mutually . A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation . 
 In an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc . 
 Well . First , make meaning clear by using concise forma language . Second , describe accurately the exact requirement . Finally , state clearly the permissible variation in quantity . 
 I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way . 
 Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . 
 Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ? 
 All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? 
 Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? 
 Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . 
 Come in , please . 
 Oh , very good . I've been waiting for your report all week . 
 OK , I will see it soon . You can go back now . 
 Bye . 
 Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply . 
 Ok . I need to discuss it with our manager . We'll let you have our firm offer next week . 
 Ok . I will reply to you as soon as possible . 
 What will you discuss at the meeting ? 
 And anything else ? 
 That's all ? 
 OK . 
 Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university . 
 No . It ’ s a pity about it . 
 Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball . 
 I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football . 
 Of course not . My school record was above average in my class . 
 English . I've liked English ever since middle school , and then in university , I had some excellent teachers . 
 They are above 90 . I ’ m in the upper third of my class . I have worked hard at my major subject . 
 I have just left school , but I am well acquainted with office work . 
 Since leaving school , I have attended typewriting and shorthand classes , and have now attained a speed of fifty and ninety works respectively . 
 I know how to gather and summarize information from the Intent , which is an essential skill for market analysis . 
 I am a good accountant and have a thorough knowledge of the English language . 
 I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve been awarded Zu Jingle Scholarship two times . 
 Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accounting through self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . 
 Yes , I used to be the monitor of my class . 
 It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . 
 It wasn't as high as I would have liked . It was 2.5 . 
 I participated in several extracurricular activities . And I worked 2 jobs to put myself through school . 

Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto . 
 A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . 

Please file all the reports for me . 
 Yes . Will you also make copies and file them using both methods ? 
 Good . Can you please also list all the documents in those old files ? 
 Before next Friday . 

How is your English ability ? 
 English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position , especially in the starting period . What ’ s your ability in these two fields ? 
 What else do you have to prove your English ability ? 
 How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 Ok ! You know you're always welcome here . Did you enjoy your stay ? 
 It's our pleasure . And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here ? 
 Don't mention it . Oh , This is a small gift for you . 
 We hope you could visit our company again . 
 Ok ! We'll definitely go to visit your company . 
 Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . 
 That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . 
 Exactly ! 
 Can I take a look at one of those ? 
 Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing . 
 I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' 
 I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . 
 It's coming along well , but it is a little delayed . 
 I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me . 
 OK , we promise to do it well . 
 Okay . Is all going well ? 
 Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ? 
 OK . If he wants to make any changes , minor alternations can be accepted . Let me know what happens . 

Steven , can you give us a summary about your work ? What do you get from your work ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 Very good . Anything else ? 
 I must praise you for your modesty and diligence . What's your plan next ? 
 I've got to commend you ; you really did a good job . 

Peter ? This is Steven from China . I've got the document you want . 
 That'll cost me a fortune . 
 OK . I'll try . But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service . 

What problems will exporters face in moving to the foreign market ? 
 Like what ? 
 Reasonable . 
 Sometimes people in different countries , or even in different parts of the same country have varying outlooks because of the tribe and culture . 
 Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . 
 At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . 
 Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Good morning ! Is Mr . Smith in ? I'm Cheng Jun from China National Petroleum Corporation . I'd like to see him . 
 Am . No , I have an urgency to talk with him . 
 Thank you . 
 It's nine o'clock now . And I'll wait for him . 
 This is Wang Miao from AB company speaking . Our CEO Mr . Green has an appointment with Mr . Liang tomorrow morning . But there is a minor change in tomorrow's schedule . Mr . Green has an abrupt urgent case tomorrow and he has to go abroad today . He wanted me to convey his apology to Mr . Wang . 
 And Mr . Green will make another appointment when Mr . Wang comes back . 
 Bye ! 

Hello , Steven . Do you have any questions to ask me ? 
 Let me see . The data documents with ' A ' and ' B ' are the drafts , and the ones with ' C ' and ' D ' are formal contracts . Do you know what I mean ? 
 Not at all . I am pleased to tell you these . 
 Sure , what's wrong ? 
 It's easy . Press O and then P . Then it will ask you for your password . 
 Just press ENTER and you've done . 
 OK ! 
 Thanks ! 
 It's comfortable , but now I'm a little tired . 
 Thank you ! I lived there when I came to Beijing last time . It's comfortable and beautiful . 
 Thank you ! I will . When and where will the dinner be ? 
 Oh , that's nice . Thank you for arranging all of this . 
 Good morning , Steven . 
 It'll be a national campaign starting next week . 
 I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . 
 Definitely . 
 You have probably noticed that our products ' prices are competitive . Besides . we can provide more superior products than other companies at the same price . 
 It means that if you place a big order , we usually allow 15 % for a trade discount . And our products feel more slip , colorful and faddish than others . You can have a look . 
 We always sell the best . You can believe us at this point . 
 Within 2 weeks once we receive your orders . 
 Well , if you can meet our deadline . 
 I also hope your quality will meet our standard . 
 Excellent . We will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands . 
 Hello , could I speak to the export manager , please ? 
 This is Joey from Mary trading company . I learned that you are the leading export of cloth by Hummed company . 
 We are interested in cloth made in China . The clothes are sold very well here . We are a big location supplier for the northeast market here . I'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities . 
 We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ? 
 How many shifts are there in your factory ? 
 What about your company's QC management ? 
 Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ? 
 It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory . 
 I'm sorry . The agreement hasn't been fully prepared . It will be ready by tomorrow . 
 I will try my best . Here is the draft . Would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed ? 
 How about the terms concerning packing ? 
 If you totally agree , I'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for signatures . 

Mr.Wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment . 
 Do you mean you prefer a deferred payment ? 
 When do you start the payment then ? 
 We can accept that but you have to pay the interest . 
 Shall we sign the agreement now ? 

The negotiation of the price has taken us a long time . I hope the following negotiation about quality will be quicker . 
 Don't worry . Our quality is based solely on our sales samples . 
 We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones . 

Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ? 
 OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms . 
 Shall we sign this contract now ? 
 Just sign at the bottom . 
 You're right . Thank you for your cooperation . 

We want to order some of these products . 
 Can you supply us right away ? 
 Good , we'll take 500 suits . 

Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior . 
 What's the answer ? 
 Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ? 
 I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month . 
 By all means . 
 Well , there are 2 reasons . First of all , I'm itching to work in a foreign enterprise . Secondly , your branch is a new establishment in Beijing . I think I'll be assigned more workload and responsibilities here . 
 Yes , of course . The balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . 
 Creativity , the ability to organize , the entrepreneur's spirit , comprehensive knowledge of human studies , ability of gathering information , expert competence of communication and deep professional skills . 
 If I'm in the service center . I'll listen to the client patiently , and accept the criticism objectively . Then I will have the claim reasonably settled . 
 I think Applied Sociology is a practical subject that can be widely applied to research on soci-ety and man . Hence , I chose it as my major . 
 I am sorry to say I haven't , but I have taken many other courses that concerns the PR , such as Social Psychology , Public Affairs and Mass Communication . 
 Yes , Mr . Li . 
 I also have done it . 
 Yes . They have been laid by their name cards on the meeting table for each attendant . 
 Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting . 
 OK , thank you very much . 

Have you had any medical experience in any hospital before coming here ? 
 How long have you been there ? 
 In what section did you work in the hospital ? 

How do you do ? I need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest ! 
 How can I find out what countries to invest ? 
 Great . I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . 

Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? 
 Well , what about price ? 

How many years have you done business with China ? 
 Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?

 Okay , what about the first woman ? 
 All right , and what about the older gentle ? 
 Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . 

How would you like this order shipped ? 
 Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . 
 I'll check the costs and call you back . 

How was your flight from Hong Kong ? 
 10:30 . I'll pick you up at the hotel at 10:00 . : 10:30 . 
 Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee . 
 I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office . 
 Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . 
 Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . 
 Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . 
 He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . 
 They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . 
 I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . 
 Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . 
 No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . 
 Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . 
 Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . 
 A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . 
 Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . 
 That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . 
 I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . 
 I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . 
 Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . 
 Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . 
 I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . 
 We see you are all dressed to the nines . 
 Yes , this runway is going to sparkle with glamour and style ! 
 And others directly from New York . 
 Because you're going to love this show ! 
 I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . 
 Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . 
 Yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . You're well informed . We'd like to build new factory . 
 We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing . 
 The time period is set on June 29th . 
 All right . The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters . You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow . 
 You're welcome . 
 It doesn't matter . We'll be in touch . 
 Bye ! 
 I should be most delighted . 
 Delighted I was able to help . 
 OK ! We'll see it . 
 We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China . 
 Yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . If you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . Besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good . 
 To our office which is on the third floor . 
 Yes . All the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening . 
 Yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously . 
 Bye ! 
 Yes , I have received an Engineers Qualification Certificate and a drivers license . 
 I have two years driving experience . 
 I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . 
 Visual C + + , C and Delphi . 
 No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . 
 I enjoyed everything , as long as I was learning . 
 Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . 
 If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again . 
 The best we can do is $ 120 per case . 
 I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . 
 It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? 
 Take your time , please . 
 Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors . 
 Band 6 . 
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t , but I'd be glad to learn . 
 Yes , I think I can . I often talk to foreigners at English corner held twice a week at my college . They say my English is pretty good . 
 I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English . 

Can you read and write English and French ? 
 Could you tell me something about your English education ? 

Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? 
 That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . 
 OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? 
 I'll tell them . 
 Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . 
 I think so . Bye ! 

Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much . 
 We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . 
 I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? 
 Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . 
 I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . 
 Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . 
 Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us . 
 We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do . 
 We are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable . We assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care . 
 Why not ? 

Why not come over to work in my company ? 
 Tell me what you need . 

Would you like me to fill out the form ? 
 That's very kind of you . 
 Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . 
 First , can I know something about your financial situations ? 
 Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? 
 Then what do you deal with ? 
 That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . 
 I'd like to hear that . 
 That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? 

Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? 
 I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? 
 Thank you . 
 You are so kind , you helped me a lot . 

Have you find any job that you are interested in ? 
 There ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . You have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ? 
 By the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . 
 It is a job at an advertisement company . 
 Anyway , it is worth trying . 
 It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . 
 Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . 
 The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . 
 Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . 
 Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . 
 The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . 
 Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . 
 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
 I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . 
 I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? 
 Is that all ? 
 I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered . 
 That's OK . 
 Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . 
 Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . 
 First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . 
 For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . 

What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ? 
 That certainly is quite an accomplishment . 
 What's your sales record been like there ? 
 If things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ? 

How do you do , Mr . Johnson ? I'm Thomas . 
 I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper . 
 I have worked for IBM for three years . 
 I know the marketing from top to bottom and I can develop a new market for you . 
 Yes , I understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company . 
 If possible , I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department . 
 I'd like to start at RIB 4,000 a month . 
 I'm on my way . 
 That's a lot to sell with very low profit margins . 
 OK . 17 % the first six months , 14 % for the second . 
 We'd like you to execute the first order by the 31 st . 
 Right . We couldn't handle much larger shipments . 
 I can agree to that . Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . 

What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . 
 Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . 
 It certainly is . 
 I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . 
 That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . 
 I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 OK . 
 I was responsible for sales . 
 Yes , I was twice singled out as an ' Advanced Worker ' . 

Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . 
 Have you received any other honors ? 
 Do you have anything published ? 

Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? 
 Could you tell me the particulars ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . 

Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? 
 What is the tariff ? 
 Why does the government levy the tariff ? 
 Anything else . 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . 

Could you copy this document for me ? 
 A hundred and fifty . No , wait , make that a hundred and sixty . 
 No , thank you . That will be all for now . 

Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ? 
 Can you give an example ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh , Are there other means ? 
 This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ? 

Miss Liu , please come in . 
 Copy this report for me . 
 You should use the A4 paper is all right . 
 It is unnecessary . 

Why isn't the project done yet ? 

This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability . 

Where do you see yourself three years from now ? 
 Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? 
 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 

Are you introverted or extroverted ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 

What do you consider to be your strong points ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Really ? Are you still playing ? 
 I see . You must be tough . 
 What do you consider to be your weak points ? 
 What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? 
 Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? 

Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? 
 Are you more of a follower or a leader ? 
 What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 

Miss Liu , have we received the fax from MS Company yet ? 
 Excellent . I have been expecting it . 
 You bet it is . It's about the new contract . 

Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? 
 Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? 
 Of course , let me find one for you . 
 I'll put them in my schedule . Are there any other messages ? 
 Thanks a lot . 

What did you usually do as a head nurse ? 
 How to maintain a high standard of nursing ? 

Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
 How about your nursing education ? 
 Can you manage English conversation ? 

Have you got any experience in advertising ? 
 Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? 
 Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? 
 Have you had any experience with computer ? 
 That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? 
 What have you learned from jobs you have held ? 
 Very good . 
 My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . 
 First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . 
 That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . 
 Yes , I liked math in school . 
 Yes , I enjoy working with people . 
 Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? 
 No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn . 

How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . 
 Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . 
 I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . 
 That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . 
 Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? 
 Very well . Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . 
 I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . 
 I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . 
 As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . 
 That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . 
 To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . 
 If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . 
 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . 
 Ok . Let's call it a deal . 
 Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . 
 If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . 
 This is our counter-offer . 
 So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . 
 Agreed . 
 Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand . 
 Your desire coincides with ours . 
 Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about benefit between us . 
 We will make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be put through between us . 
 I hope everything will be smooth . 
 I will give you the lowest price in the future . 

Hello , Mr . Jones . We need to have a meeting to discuss our deal . 
 That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? 
 Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? 
 Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ? 
 Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ? 

Good morning ! My name is John White , import manager of the Garden Trading Company of New York . 
 Nice to meet you Mr.Li . We have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . As you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm . 
 Yes , I had a look just now , I feel we can do a lot of business in this line . 
 Our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years , we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the America , and we have good reputation in the commercial circle . 
 Sure . 
 Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! 
 Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday . 
 Yes , Mr . Li . Everyone has been informed . 
 I see . 
 Nice to meet you ! 
 Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much ! 
 Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you . 
 This is our common desire . 
 Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . 
 Sure . 
 Well , as a rule , the contract will become void automatically , if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes . 
 Oh , I am sorry . I misunderstood . Well , in that case , the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice . What do you say ? 

What experience do you have with office machinery ? 
 Where do you want to be in five years ? 
 Very good . Any questions ? 

What do you think a job is ? 
 Where do you see yourself three years from now ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 
 You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye . 

What do you want to do in this company after five years ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 What are you looking for in your next job ? 
 What is your career objective ? 
 What do you consider important when looking for a job ? 

Please sit down . 
 From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ? 
 Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ? 
 That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly . 
 What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ? 
 That can be a rough job , you know . 
 Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ? 
 I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days . 

What do you expect to be doing five years from now ? What are your medium-term career goals ? 

Good morning ! I am a rookie in our office . 
 Nice to meet you ! My name is Peter Smith . 
 This is my first day at work ! 
 I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance ! 
 Thank you . It is very kind of you . 

What are your career goals , Miss Li ? 
 Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours . 
 Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work . 

What companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ? 
 What section would you like to work in if you enter this company ? 
 What type of work will you expect to do at first ? 
 What are your plans for the future ? 
 How long does it take to get here from your home ? 
 How long do you think that we can depend on your working here ? 
 You are single now , but what will you do when you get married ? 
 Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ Ve had a child ? 
 What ideas do you have if we employ you ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 If you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ? 
 If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ? 
 What do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ? 
 What are your expectations from working on this job ? 
 If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? 
 If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? 

Mr . Smith just called me back . 
 We got the contract ! 

Hi , I'm calling about the ad in the paper . 
 For the job . 
 Oh ! It was for a market sale manager . Is that still available ? 
 What company is this for ? I mean where's the opening ? 
 Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them . 
 So you're a headhunter . 

How about your interview ? 
 Why ? You are so excellent . 
 What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! 
 I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet . 
 It's very convenient and it has become popular recently . 
 Of course , if you log on some standard websites . 

Paul , a company called me for an interview . 
 How ? 
 OK . 
 Is a white blouse OK ? 
 How about make up ? 

I called about that ad we saw in the paper . 
 That's the one . 
 You were right . It was from a headhunter . She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract . 
 No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work . 
 I'm going there tomorrow . 

May I help you ? 
 I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ? 
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . 
 What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? 
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? 
 ( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? 
 All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . 
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . 
 Can I give her a message for you ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Certainly . 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Well , first you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I'll go get some . 
 Good morning , Vera , Nice to meet you . 
 Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick . 
 Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact . 
 That ’ s all right . Hope you can do better tomorrow . 
 Good morning , sir ! 
 Thank you , sir . 
 My name is Du Tao , number 3 . 
 Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao . 
 I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now . 
 I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U . 
 Gladly , 8962105 2 . 
 I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have . 
 If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable . 

We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 How are your typing and shorthand skills ? 

How many kinds of secretaries work here ? 
 What sort of duties do you expect ? 

I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either . 
 Do you have anyone in mind ? 
 Who ? 
 Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ? 

Well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ? 
 Yes , our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses . 
 I've enjoyed the conversation with you . We'll call you within 5 working days . 

Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . 
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . 
 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
 Please call me or send e-mail . Could you please let me know when your organization can make a decision ? 
 I really appreciate your time and help . See you then . 
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 
 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 

You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ? 
 How many years have you been learning English ? 
 Well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it . 

What do you think of your personality ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ? 

When can you start the job ? 
 Can you start on Monday ? 
 That's all right . When you come , ask for Smith , OK ? 

Hello , this is Lin Tao . I am calling to inquire about my interview result last week . 
 Sorry to hear that , but could you inform me why I failed ? 

Did you hear something ? 
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . 
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . 

Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 

I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . 
 Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . 
 Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . 
 We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences . 
 Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 Good idea . 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . 
 OK , thank you , I'll try if there were other chances . 
 It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ? 
 I get it , and thank you for your honesty . 
 I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in . 
 I will . Thank you . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs . 

I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 Thank you . Here is a copy of the Tour Guide Certificate of mine . 
 Yes , but I am on holidays this week . 
 I am bilingual , English and Russian . 
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 

What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 

We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things . 
 Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 

Have you had any publications ? 
 How about your communication skills ? 

What was your duty like in your previous job ? 
 Can you name a few examples ? 

Thank you for calling ABC company , may I help you ? 
 Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and Jim Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? 
 He is on the line . 
 As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others . 
 I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly . 
 You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . 
 Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . 
 Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . 
 Try to be natural , alert and interested . 
 My pleasure . Good luck to you . 
 Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... 
 Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . 
 Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . 
 Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . 

May I help you ? 
 You are Miss Liu ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 We have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview . 
 Have you brought your credentials ? 

What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 Are you more of a follower or a leader ? 

How do you spend your free time ? 
 Are you introverted or extroverted ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 

Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . 
 What did you do in the interview ? 
 Are all these helpful for the interview ? 
 Anything else ? 

May I come in ? 
 Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested . 
 Thank you . 
 I majored in Public Relations . 
 Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year . 
 The export Business Section . 
 Yes , very much . 

Do you have any special interests besides your job ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 There is a reason in what you say . 
 Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking . 
 I divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively . It can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students . 
 It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little . I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world . 
 I want to work in the English Department , as I am an English major . 
 You mean the network connection ? 
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 

A : Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . 
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . 

How are your Chinese and English ? 
 How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? 

Why do you change your job and apply for a translator ? 
 What do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ? 

Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? 
 Yeah , that is very important . 
 I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . 
 Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? 
 I've got it . I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie . Thank you for your suggestions . 
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . 
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . 
 Buy an expensive suit . 
 The more expensive , the better . 
 That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . 
 If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . 
 Black is good . 
 No . Dark or skin colored . 
 Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . 
 Not much make up . 
 Yes , some . But be aware that different people may like different scents . 
 Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . 
 I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . 
 I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd . I have been working there since 1997 . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department . 
 My name is Zhang Due . 
 I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade . My major was International Trade . 
 Yes , I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . 
 But it's the style now . 
 Of course . 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 What happened to her ? 
 I see . 
 I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times . 
 Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . 
 Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class . 
 It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . 
 Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office . 
 Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . 
 So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . 
 That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . 
 It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . 
 I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 
 You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . 
 You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . 
 It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . 
 I'm working on my resume . 
 Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . 
 I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . 
 Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . 
 How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? 
 I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the exile market in China . 
 They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . 
 I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . 
 I prefered working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can't do without them . 
 Hello , Finn . I did a wonderful job and I was employed . How about you ? 
 Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . 
 What ? Then what did you do ? 
 You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . 
 Good luck next time . 

Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ? 
 What kind of information would you like ? 
 Yes , it's still open . 
 Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? 

Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company . 
 Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin . 
 As you know , Miss Wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills . We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . 
 Today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you . And the interview will last a little bit longer . So , if you ’ re comfortable , I want to ask you some questions . 
 ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . 
 Thank you . Have you received my resume ? 
 Of course , here you are , sir . 
 Certainly , Mr . Smith . 
 Yes , I've just married . 
 I have been married for three years . 
 There are four people in my family . 
 My husband , my mother-in-law , my daughter and I . 
 I live in Beijing . 
 My permanent address is Apt . 401 , 238 Zhongshan Road , Beijing . 
 My birthplace is Suzhou . 
 My domicile is Beijing . 
 ( My telephone number is ) 139xxxxx345 . 
 Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . 
 Did you get a copy of the Herald too ? 
 That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . 
 It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . 
 Good idea . 
 Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? 
 What ’ s this form for ? 
 That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? 
 Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? 
 Then , what do you think I should do ? 
 I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . 

I called about that ad we saw in the paper . 
 That ’ s the one . 
 You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . 
 No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . 
 I ’ m going there tomorrow . 
 And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . 

The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? 
 It better be more than last year . 

Did you call me , sir ? 
 What am I expected to do ? 
 I see . It must be a challenging job , but I would like to do it . And what about now ? 
 OK , I'll get to work on it at once . 
 I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell . 
 Really ? Since I have to go back to England within the next few months , I would like to sell my apartment as soon as possible . 
 Flat C . 15 / F , Tong House , Tai Koo Shing . 
 Its gross area is approximately nine hundred square feet . There's one living room , one dining room , one master bedroom and two other bedrooms . 
 It faces south with a hillside view . 
 I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars . 
 Johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 . My office number is 2123456 7 . 
 In about one month . 
 No problem . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm not sure . I can't agree , dan . 
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 

Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star . 
 I was hoping to talk to you today about your business . 
 How long have you been the owner of your computer shop ? 
 And how many staff do you employ ? 
 So this is a family business . 
 And how many computers do you sell each day ? 
 That about one hundred a month . 
 Thank you B for your time . 

Good Morning Ann . 
 How about a cup of coffee ? 
 And can you tell me what meetings I have this week ? 
 Okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm . 
 Okay , what time is my meeting in London ? 
 Who is Ms Von ? 

Good coming ! Welcome to J P Interior Design . 
 Yes , we do . Do you have any specific needs ? 
 Do you prefer some specific style ? 
 What kind of color tones do you like ? 
 I see . And what kind of feeling do you want to create for your kitchen ? 
 Fine , we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it . 
 Okay . Would you please leave your address and phone number ? 

Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 Do I have to send an E-mail ? 
 But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . 
 Can any unit see my information ? 
 Which websites offer this service ? 
 Thank you . 
 I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . 
 OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . 
 Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . 

Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently . 
 Don't be proud . You'll gain a lot in the following job . 
 B , talking about salary is not smart . You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills . 
 Okay , You are such a good talker . 
 Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late . 
 I said I was terribly sorry . But he said it was quite all right . 
 No , he didn't scold me because he was late , too . 
 Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done . 
 I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . 
 I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . 
 Oh , I am sorry . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t do it now . I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds . But I could mail it after that . 
 I won ’ t . 
 Don ’ t mention it . See you . 
 Welcome and nice to meet you . I heard you were coming today . Is today your first day here in the company ? 
 First day is often exciting , isn't it ? Here , let me show you to your desk . You can have this computer and telephone and share the copy machine with us in the office . How do you like it ? 
 You are welcome . And , please call me Betty . 
 Yes , I'm leaving on the 14th of next month . 
 Actually , it is a policy in my company . The human resources management department has connections overseas this year , so we can receive training there . 
 No . The company pays for everything . Doesn't this sound very attractive ? This is why our company can always get the best employees ! 
 Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . 
 Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . 
 All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . 

Can you skillfully operate the computer ? 
 What kind of software can you use ? 
 Do you have any certificates on computer ? 
 Any other certificates ? 
 Do you have any other special skills ? 

Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . 
 Have you received any other honors ? 
 Do you have anything published ? 

Were you in a leadership position when you were a college student ? 
 Did you get any honors or awards at your university ? 
 Were you involved in any club activities at your university ? 
 What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ? 

As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? 
 And we should have good sitting posture . 
 Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? 
 I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . 
 I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . 

I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . 
 I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . 
 I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . 
 Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . 
 Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? 
 I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . 
 I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . 
 Yes , I have a driving license . 
 Sure . 
 That's fine with me . 
 As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . 
 I think I can commute that far without any trouble . 
 No , nothing in particular . Thank you . 
 Yes , but I don't mind working hard . 
 Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . 
 I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . 
 Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . 
 I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . 
 Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . 
 Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! 
 Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company . 
 Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ? 
 How can I have the good external expressions ? 

What is your long term career plan you set for yourself ? 

Are you Miss Thou Ping ? 
 How do you spell you first name ? 
 Do you have an English name ?

 Where is it ? 
 Do you have a big family at your hometown ?

Employees in this company have to have a good command of English . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 Well , then , please tell me about your English education . 
 I see , do you speak any other languages ? 

What's your name ? 
 A nice name , isn't it ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Oh , It's really far from here . May I ask how old you are ? 
 You look very young . 
 Where is your birthplace ? 

When can you give me the final decision ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you for your interview with me . 
 I think we'll send you a letter next week , if you are wanted , or we may give you a call . By the way , have you got a telephone ? 
 What's the best time to call you , then ? 
 Thank you for coming , Miss Yang . 

Hello , this is Li Bo speaking . 
 Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations ! 
 Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality . 
 I agree . 
 From 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m . 
 Of course , if necessary . 
 Seldom . 
 Your quantity sold is beyond the required by more than 30 % . 
 Same here , Ms . Drake . I've been looking forward to this . 
 No , no , no , not at all , you were right on time . I was early . I hope I didn ’ t rush you . I ’ m glad for the opportunity to interview with you . 
 I ’ m fine , thank you . 
 Great , that ’ s why I ’ m here . 
 Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 You may ask questions about us , if you have any . 

Would you like to travel ? 
 How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ? 
 That's fine . What salary do you get at your present position ? 
 We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ? 
 Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . 

Are you willing to work abroad ? 
 How about your family ? 

My name is James Owen . I ’ m Manager of Sales . How do you do ? 
 Thank you for coming . Did you have any trouble finding the office ? 
 I apologize for this mess . They ’ Ve got me handling so many projects , and it ’ s hard to keep things organized . 
 Well . Miss Sun , as you know , we are looking for an executive secretary with good English skills and some business background . We looked over your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . 
 Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you . If needed , there will be a more lengthy interview later . So , if you ’ re comfortable , let's begin . 

If we employ you , what starting salary would you expect ? 
 I think your background and experience are worth the compensation . 
 No , there are annual bonuses , one week paid vacation a year , and health insurance . 

Come in , young man . 
 I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? 
 Call me Mr . Smith . 

Please come in and sit down . I'm happy to finally meet you . 
 I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today . 
 Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?

 How long have you been married ? 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 Who are the members of your family ? 

Where do you see yourself three years from now ?

What is your major ? 
 Which university are you attending ? 
 Have you received any degrees ? 
 What course did you like best ? 
 Do you feel that you have received a good general training ?

Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office . 
 Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams . 
 Today is my first day at work ! 
 Thank you . It's very kind of you . 

Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you . 
 If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up . 
 It's my pleasure . Well , then . I'll say goodbye . 

Today is Saturday , isn't it ? 
 What's the date today ? 
 I have a meeting this afternoon . 
 It will begin at three o'cock . What's the time now ? 
 I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 

I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM's China Headquarters . 
 You did a good job for the company . You deserve it . 
 So . this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? 
 I believe you are cut out for this position . You're an outstanding individual . 

Good morning , Mr Wang . 
 It's just nine o'clock . 
 Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ? 
 You must leave home earlier today . 
 Why are you so early today ? 

Hello , John , please invite all our clients to the conference next week . 
 Get the clients ' contact info from my Rolodex . 
 How about the Holiday Inn ? 
 Well , the client is always right . 
 Please print out the meeting agenda for me to look over . 
 And make sure to return my Rolodex to my desk when you are done with it . 

Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? 
 Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . 
 Do you think the trend will continue ? 
 Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . 
 Yes , Mr . Miller . We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting . 
 In the dining room . It's spacious there . 
 I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English . 
 We've prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for guests to sit by . What time would you like refreshments served , Mr . Miller ? 
 All right , I see . 
 Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? 
 Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . 
 That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . 
 That sounds good . 
 Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . 
 Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . 
 It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? 
 All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . 
 Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . 
 Oh , yes . Marvelous ! 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Ok , under this contract , we ’ ll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts , S , M and L equally assorted , at USD 100 per dozen , CFR London . Shipment in July . Payment by irrevocable sight LC . 
 You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract . But there is also one point I ’ d like to stress . 
 Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment , otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship . 
 The goods will be inspected by the China Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau . It will then issue certificate of quality and a certificate of weight . These will be taken as final and biding . 
 Naturally . Each of us keeps one original and two copies . 
 Good . 
 I have a typical nine to five job . Actually , I work a little longer than nine to five most days . 
 No , I don't . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 We have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . We can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time . 
 There's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 I work in a cubicle too , but I don't mind it . 
 Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets . 
 Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for . 
 No problem . Let's check the terms of contract . 
 Yes . He's waiting for you in his office . This way , please . 
 Really ? How did it go ? 

I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? 
 Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . 
 Very good . How many goods do you have ? 
 We want to order 900 dozen . 

I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . 
 20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ? 
 Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ? 
 The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? 
 That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . 
 Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . 
 When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . 
 There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . 
 Ok . I can settle for that . 
 Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . 
 This is already our best price . 
 Well , what would you suggest ? 
 I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . 
 It's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount . 
 But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % . 
 Maybe we would consider a longer credit period . 

We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem . 
 The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price . 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies . 
 I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . 
 All right , we'll wait for your answer . 
 We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . 
 No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . 
 We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . 
 We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . 

I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ? 
 All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ? 
 Go ahead . 

If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . 
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . 
 No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . 
 I hope you can try to get them to step up production . 
 If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . 
 What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? 
 All right . I'll take your words at that . 
 I promise . 
 Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember your company . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . 
 Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? 
 All right , expecting you . 
 Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . 
 No wonder . 
 Thank you ! 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 
 Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . 
 Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB 

Is there anything that you are interested in ? 
 Yes . It's a prototype of our new product . It has got more advantages than the second did . 
 It will be released next month . 
 We have developed new technology about it . And the new product will be a pleasure to be hold . 

I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? 
 I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . 
 All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? 
 It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . 

What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? 
 Shall we leave it to the brokers ? 
 Do they charge for that ? 
 Is it the same in America ? 
 It's part of their service , isn't it ? 
 Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? 
 I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? 
 I see . Thank you . 

Thomas , could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you pick up Mrs . David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport ? 
 I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him . 
 Thanks a lot . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate . 
 Oh , yes , I have . I worked part-time as a typewriter in a computer company when I was at college . 
 In my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind . 

Excuse me , is this personnel division ? 
 I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner . 
 My name is Li Jean . 
 Yes , seven years . 
 Master of Marketing Management . 
 Yes . I worked at AB Company . 
 Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English . I think I am fit for the position . 
 That's very good . 
 I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people . 
 I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on . 
 Yes , I have learned Japanese as well . 
 Yes , I know . But I don't mind working hard . 
 No . I only wish that you could give me a definite answer to my application as soon as possible . 
 Yes , but I will graduate from the Shanghai Finance and Trade school next month . 
 I'm sure . You know my major is statistics and I get excellent records in all of the courses I have taken . 
 Yes , my father runs a business so I have opportunity to work in the finance department every holiday . 
 Thank you . 
 Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? 
 OK . Let me see where to start . 
 Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . 
 Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? 
 Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . 
 No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . 
 You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . 
 And one more thing , smile widely . 
 You are the leading company in the computer industry . 
 First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . 
 In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field . 
 Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . 
 Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . 
 Yes , I did . 
 I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . 
 I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . 
 I studied at Anshan University . 
 Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season . 
 Yes , but I learned a lot . 
 I learned about different tax laws and how they work . 
 Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . 
 But most of time , they provide assistances . 
 Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates . 
 The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . 
 Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . 

Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? 
 How should I contact them ? 
 Can I get a quick reply from the sites ? 

Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on , what have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I'll help you type one up . 

Well , I ’ Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers . 
 Well , Ted , this is a very impressive resume . However , we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . We ’ ll call you by Friday , if that ’ s all right . 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company . 
 Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job . 

Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? 
 But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . 
 Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? 

Anything else ? 
 Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . 
 You get five paid sick days . 
 Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . 
 We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . 
 Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? 
 I am happy to hear that and I'll accept that . 
 No , I am single . 
 No , I had no interest in the activities in college and I spent most of my spare time reading in the library . 
 None , I guess . My only passion is on reading . 
 Yes , I have obtained an accountant's qualification and a driver's license . 
 I spent a year to get my license . 
 Yes , I have an overall understanding . 
 Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? 
 But if I don't pass , will you call me ? 
 Then do I have the chance to get this job ? 
 I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . 
 Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . 

What is the great trait in your personality ? 
 So you may like inventive jobs . 

Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
 What are they ? 
 And what is the most important point ? 

What are your plans for the future if you are hired ? 
 Do you have any short-term goals ? 

Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
 How do you plan to do your present job ? 

Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? 
 Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . 
 Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . It is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? 
 I got it . Thank you so much . 

Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . 
 Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality 
 Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . 
 But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . 
 You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . 
 In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . 

Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? 
 That's a high price . 
 I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . 

Did you have any publications ? 
 Have you received any honors ? 

Brandy , I am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow . 
 How ? 
 Is a white shirt OK ? 

Excuse me . What should I wear if I want to go to an interview ? 
 I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . 

DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB . 
 Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? 

Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . 
 I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . 
 The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . 
 I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 Yes . You should rent a brown suit and a black shirt . 
 Yes . Let me help you . 
 Oh , sure . How are you ? Long time no see . How are things at Lemans ? 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . 
 I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . 
 Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me . 
 Yes . What size are you ? 
 Try this on please . 
 The rent is 400 yuan a day . 
 What do you mean ? 
 We'd better take it up with them , in that case . 
 Why not ? 
 We'll have to talk this over some more . 
 The order was in good shape when it left out factory . 
 We'll make it right with you , of course . 
 What kind of price did you want ? 
 That will probably be Ok . 
 Go ahead , please . 
 You'll have 10 days paid vacation every year . 
 We will provide you with life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . 
 You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . 
 We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . 
 Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I wish to have a job in which I can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement . And your company meets all my requirements . 
 Yes , I have purposefully done some homework in advance . 
 Actually , I have applied to several companies recently . But I am most satisfied with your company . 
 Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me . 
 I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well . 
 In my mind , salary is not the most important thing . 
 Have you made an appointment with this company ? 
 Yes , it's very important to make an appointment before the interview . 
 If you go to the company without appointment , the interviewers may happen to be busy with other things , and have no time to give you an interview . 
 If the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing . 
 So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview . 
 You could directly call the company and arrange the time and place for the interview . 
 If you succeed in doing that , you must attend the interview on time . 
 We can inform the department in charge and ask for revocation of passport . 
 We need a detention warrant . 
 Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? 
 Sure , I'd love to . Thank you . 
 Mr . Smith is not in his office . I am afraid he will not be back before 3 pm . Would you care to speak to Mr . Brown who takes all the calls in his absence ? 
 OK , I'll tell him that you called . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours . 
 Hi , I'm calling from Nika Corporation . We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant . 
 There will be about 18 people . 
 Is there an extra charge to reserve the room ? 
 That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ? 
 Oh , that's fine . 
 Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 . 
 Sounds good . Thanks for your help . 

Would you like to come to our factory for a visit ? 
 You can look around our new workshops and the automatic machines .

Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? 
 Are all of your team members on schedule ? 
 How have they decided to deal with that ? 
 That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? 
 Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . 
 That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline . 
 I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening .

 You ’ re welcome . 
 I think so too , and you have a general understanding of the company now . 
 What else do you want to know ? 
 Then , how much do you wish to be paid each month ?

 You will have a six-month internship after you enter our company . During this period you can get 2,500 yuan a month , and after that you can get 3,500 yuan per month . 
 You can also get a bonus at the end of the year , and if you can keep working in the company , your salary will get a raise every year .

 Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .

 I'm headed to the 18th floor , the top floor . 
 Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ? 
 To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous . I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . Oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms . Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece .

 It sounds like a good idea . 

Hello , this is Julie from Google Corp . Is that Jin Lili ? 
 I am calling to impart the news that you are supposed to have an interview . 
 I said that you are supposed to have an interview . 

Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . 
 I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . 
 Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? 
 How do you work with a team ? 
 What ’ s your long term goal ? 

Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! 
 After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? 
 The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . 
 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. 
 We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . 
 No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . 
 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . 
 Done . Here is my paper . 
 What about the 3rd round ? 

Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? 
 But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same . 

How much are you asking for this ? 
 Is tax already included in their price ? 
 Would you consider a volume discount ? 
 I'll accept your offer . 
 Definitely . I Ve got the hell out of the company . Anything new ? 
 Really ? Are you willing to recommend me for the position ? 
 I appreciate the effort , sir . 
 No . I think I've known enough . Thank you . 
 Alright , see you . 
 15 dollars per dozen 
 However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . 
 This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . 
 We'll have to discuss the problem later . 
 Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? 
 Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . 

So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? 
 Did he actually say that ? 
 Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? 
 Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . 
 Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 What ? I can barely hear you because your veiled voice ?

 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 The volume is too loud . Would you kindly turn it down a little bit ?

 I am calling to check your information before the interview . What position did you apply ? 
 Excuse me . Could you slow down a little ? I couldn't catch you . 

Hi , this is China Southern Airlines . Is that Miss . Ye ? 
 I am responsible for verifying your information before you come for the interview . What , uh , position do you want ... uh ... to do ? 
 Sorry , I am used to speaking in a slow pace , but I will try to be faster . What position do you want to do ? 

Hello , Lucy . This is Monica again . I have a question . 
 I was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer , an e-resume or a paper one ? 
 Ok , thank you . 

Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ? 
 Sure . 
 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . 
 Well , I will text it to you . Thank you , bye for now . 

If I understand the terms correctly , the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option . Is that correct ? 
 I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms . 
 Could you elaborate on that ? 
 Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? 
 Okay , that's clear enough . Let's move on to the other terms . 
 Yes . I once worked in a small stock exchange . My work is very simple . 
 No , I thought it too dull . Also I didn't think it was challenging enough . 
 The stock exchange where I worked was too small My further promotion was impossible . I am able of more responsibilities , so I decided to leave . 
 It is a way to make a living , but beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development . It can prove your ability . 
 I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs . 
 Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . 
 Listening carefully can show you understand and respect the speaker . 
 Besides , you can pick up some helpful information from the talk . 
 To show that you have understood what is said , you can nod or ask simple questions at the right time . 
 Never should you interrupt on a unfamiliar topic . 
 Additionally , don't show any impatience to a repeated topic . 
 In a word , any impolite behavior should be avoided in the listening . 
 It provides breads and butter of your family . Besides , it simulates you to purse noble dreams , 
 Your company is well-known for its good corporate profile and rapid growing records . I want to work for a company that can display my abilities and talents . 
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! 
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . 
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 

What prompted you to apply to this company ? 
 Why do I have to hire you ? 

Greetings should never be ignored in the interview . 
 Appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression 
 In the beginning of the interview , greet the interviewer with a kind smile . 
 That's right . Details can mean succeed or fail . 
 At the end of the interview , you should make your acknowledgements and say Goode . 
 Only in this way can you leave a good impression on the interviewer . 

This is today ’ s schedule . At 8: 30AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives . 
 3000 RIB as bonus for each person . 
 Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch . 
 At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 

We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank . 
 Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . 
 Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . 
 Never should you give an answer completely beside the point . 
 Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . 
 Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . 

What about the working hours ? 
 I like flexible hours . 
 No , I don't . 
 Nope . Our company is private-owned and its profit is the biggest issue . We don't think that further study has anything to do with our development and profit-making . 
 Nope . We just hope our employees will make profit for us . 
 Generally speaking , you are supposed to come at 9:00 am . 
 You should start from 1:30 pm in the afternoon . 
 Usually , you cannot prepare for these questions in advance and have to depend on your immediate performance . 
 In this case , you should first keep calm and normal to the face . 
 Formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . 
 Try to show the best of yourself with decent words and manners . 
 You should admit your weakness frankly . 
 You must have confidence in yourself . 
 Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics . 
 Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company . 
 Yeah , I had been in the charity organization for 2 months and I learned a lot from that experience , including love , sympathy , equality , and so on . 
 I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . 
 Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . 
 Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . 
 You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help . 
 Yes , Sir . 
 All right , who should I send them to ? 
 Ok , home or office address ? 
 Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 

I think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 I'm sorry we can't now . 
 Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . 
 Anything else ? 
 I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . 
 Yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . 

Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ? 
 Are you in robust health ? 

Francis , what ’ s that ? 
 Could you tell me something about it ? 
 How many departments do we have ? 
 Ok . Who should I report to ? 

Would you mind if I ask your health status ? 
 That is good . We hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy . 

What is your greatest strength ? 
 Why do you say that ? 

How long does it take to get to downtown from here ? 
 What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? 
 Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? 
 It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? 

Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 I think I can handle it by myself . 
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
 Like this one ? 
 Yeah , thank you for telling me . 

How much is your last salary ? 
 How much do you want us to pay you ? 

Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . 
 We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . 
 We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . 
 Don't forget to say " Thank you " when you take a seat . 
 You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . 
 Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again . 

Will you sit down , Mr . White ? 
 I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China . 
 This food is a Wax specialty . Please help yourself . 

What salary are you expecting ? 
 It can be anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 a year depending on experience and qualifications . 

Do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account ? 
 No problem . We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen .. 

Could I ask the company for the housing ? 
 How will you solve the problem ? 

Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image . 
 You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him . 
 When you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer . 
 Proper posture can show your confidence . 
 Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . 
 In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview . 

When the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief . 
 At this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview . 
 Don't forget to ask when you can receive a reply . 
 You should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently . 
 In this case , you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get . 
 Just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave . 

May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 
 Thank you for telling me that . 
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . 
 I got it . 
 I see . 
 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? 
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? 
 It is OK with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . 
 No , I don't . Please . 
 Of course . And 2 - week paid vacation a year , a 5 - day work week . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 

What kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ? 
 What if an employee was injured due to work-related job ? 

Do you give me a bonus ? 
 Do you allow any commission ? 

Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . 
 You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . 
 Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . 
 Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . 
 You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . 
 Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . 

Besides salary what kind of allowance can I expect ? 
 Can you elaborate it more concretely ? 

I want to know whether you can handle the matters of registered permanent residence . 
 I have no other questions . Thank you . 

Can we talk about the working overtime issue ? What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Glad to hear that . Generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours . 

Do I often have to work overtime ? 
 Is there any extra pay for that ? 

Can you offer the Five Insurances for me ? 
 How are they get paid ? 

Jack , I don't know how to write my resume . Could you tell me about that ? 
 What does the contact information include ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I see . It is the position desired 
 I see . Skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . But what about related experience ? I have little work experience . 
 I see . By the way , should I write the educational background starting from elementary school ? 
 Thank you very much . I will write it right now . 
 Hello , this is Wang Li . I want to know the status of the position . 
 When can I know whether I'm accepted or not ? 

This is Mary . I just want to let you know that we made an offer to you . The salary is 3,000 yuan a month , I e-mailed the offer to you as well . You can let me know within a week if you accept the offer . 
 We hope you get on board with us , Please let me know as soon as possible . 

Mary , besides the resume , I think we should also write an application letter . 
 I think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal . 
 We should say we are very interested in that job , and we hope to get that job . 
 For example , I have mastered Business English very well , and I also know a little Spanish . 
 You can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in English . 
 Let's write it at once . 
 Thank you for hiring me . I'm very proud to be employed by your firm . 
 Yes , I will . I hope I'll enjoy working with you . 
 Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . 
 We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply . 

What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 What is your problem in working ? 

I have a little trouble , and I don't know how to deal with it . 
 Tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him , but I don't know how to write it . 
 Really ? Tell me without delay . 
 Well , I see . 
 It's easy to write those . 
 Tom got along well with classmates . He is really a good boy . 
 What should I write except these ? 
 OK , I will remember . 
 I am a little bit shy and I blush every time I speak in public . I think I should open myself more and be more outward with people . 
 I am self-indulgent sometimes . 
 Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! 
 What was so bad about it ? 
 Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . 

Good morning , this is Mary . 
 Hello , Jane ! Is that the Human Resource Department ? 
 I had an interview with your company two weeks ago . I am calling to ask about the interview result . I hope you can give me a positive reply . 
 Thank you ! I am glad to hear that . When would it be convenient for me to start working ? 
 What is the starting salary for me ? 
 I appreciate the offer . I will come on time next Monday . See you then !

 About two weeks .

I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 

What kind of job do you intend to do ? 
 What are your plans if you were hired ? 

What is your long-term goal in this career ? 
 What would you do to achieve that ? 

I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday 
 I really enjoyed meeting with you . 
 I am very interested in this position . 

I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . 
 I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? 
 Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . 
 So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . 
 You are very nice to tell me those . 
 Thank you ! 
 Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ? 
 Do you mean all the sales letters from them ? 
 I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ? 
 No problem . 
 Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract . 
 Yes , I got it . Thanks . 
 You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability . 
 No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again . 
 OK , I will . 
 That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . 
 It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet . 
 You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . 
 I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it . 
 After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply . 

How are you , Mr . Stone ? I m Farley . 
 Please have a seat . I know our employment officer has already given you information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'llbe getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of employment . 
 No probation is involved . 
 What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
 Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . 
 I'd like to begin to work any time you want . 
 No problem . See you next Monday . 
 Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment . 
 Yes , of course . In accounting , cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank . 
 What ’ s to get ready ? 
 Nope . 
 Nope . 
 Good morning . Thank you . 
 Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I'm also in the process of writing my first novel . 

We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . 
 Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . 
 Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! 

Hello , Parker . How's everything ? 
 Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ? 
 Great . 
 Not really . What ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . 

what are your strong points ? 
 what kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 what ’ s your greatest strength ? 
 so , you ’ re smart . 
 what do you consider your weakness ? 
 that ’ s not a problem . It ’ s unnecessary for this position .

 21st Talent Website , 51 Job , and Zhaopin.com are most popular .

 Yes , I do . I have a 10:00 appointment with her this morning . 
 My name is Bruce Green . 
 Thank you . 
 How is the new product ?

 Yes , I agree with you . We should add our opinions to the research report . 

Good morning , Mr.Robinson . I am afraid there is a change in today's program . I just got word that your appointment with Mr . Smith , the general manager of Western Textile Co . , Ltd . , will have to be put off . 
 Mr.Smith called just now that he had to fly to Shanghai on urgent business today . 
 Mr.Smith is sending his apologies and has asked me to find out if the day after tomorrow would be all right with you .

 Thanks a lot . 
 I need it . Thank you . 
 I'm fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It's hard to keep track of everything around here . 
 Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? 
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 
 Does it ever ! Well , let's get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I'll see what else needs to be done . 
 That's a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . 
 Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? 
 Yes , I am . 
 How do you do ? 
 It's kind of you to meet me at the airport . 
 No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city . 
 Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here . 
 Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited . I would like to see Mr . Smith . 
 Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . 
 Sure . 
 That would be very nice . Thank you . 

Welcome to our factory . 
 Actually , you'll know our products better after the visit . I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along . 
 Maybe we could start with the Design Department . And then we could look at the production line . 
 About 10 % of the gross sales . 

All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ? 
 I tell you what , 8: 00 is no good for me , but why don't you guys get started and I'll come by at around 8: 45 or so . 

Hi , John Phillips ? I ’ m Rose Green . I ’ Ve been asked to handle your training and introduce a little bit of the company to you . It ’ s nice to meet you . 
 After a week , you ’ ll be running around here like a pro . Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager . 

Good evening ! I don't believe we've met before . May I introduce myself ? My name is Jack . 
 I'm very happy to meet you . You're from the United States , aren't you ? 
 I've been to Salt Lake City a few times . I really like your city . 

Hi there ! My name's Terry Graham . You're new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there's anything I can do for you , let me know . 

We hope that partial shipment is allowed . 
 Shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments . 

When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem . What is the exact address , again ? 

I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . 
 The earliest we can do is by the end of June . 
 I'm very sorry to hear that . 
 We'll take great care . 
 We should have it put together by the end of next week . 
 Well , as the saying goes – we aim to please ! 
 Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? 
 Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . 
 Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . 
 I see.OK , that's agreed then . 
 Just about . It should be done in the next couple of days . Why ? 
 I'll give him a call . 
 That's good ! This is our first transaction . I hope you'll be entirely satisfied with this initial shipment .

 It is lithium which can be used for over three years . 
 That's right , Ms . Bower . How are you ? I'm not sure if I ’ ll be able to fit you in this week , I ’ m afraid .

 I'm from CTC Trade Company . Here is my card . 
 I'm glad to meet you here . You're Ms . ... 
 Thank you , Ms . In . I'm here to discuss the possibility of establishing business relations with your corporation . 
 Yes , I had a look around yesterday . I wish I could have them all . Can you give me a price list with specifications ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you for your invitation . I'm free tonight . 
 I prefer seafood . 
 That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , I'm now working in a company . 
 Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . 
 No , I don't think we have . 
 How do you do ? My name is James Green . 
 And here's mine . 
 And I'm glad to meet you , too . 
 Haven't you met yet ? 
 I'll be glad to do it . 
 All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues . 
 I just did what I should have done . 
 Thank you for your compliments . I will try even harder to repay the company and your support . 
 Thanks for saying so . 
 Hello , is that Miss Smith ? 
 This is Mr.Gao . How are you ? 
 Fine . Listen . Are you free on Wednesday night ? I'd like to invite you to dinner . 
 That's a pity . How about Thursday ? 
 Great . What time would you like to meet ? 
 OK , let's say 6 
 I can pick you up at the gate of your company . Also , what type of food do you like ? 
 Well , have you heard of Peking Duck ? it's a local specialty . 
 OK , let's have that then . 
 See you later , goodbye . 
 Very well , thank you . And you ?

 they are doing well . 
 Of course . They will be happy you asked about them . 
 Oh , thank you . What is the occasion ? 
 Oh , yes , I'd very much like to go . 
 I'll be there in time . 
 Bye . 
 No . I am Canadian . Are you Chinese ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Let me show you around . 
 About two years , but it seems as if I got here yesterday . 
 So soon . It seems as if you just got here . 
 It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . 
 It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . 
 Oh , yes . I should be there sometime next spring . 

Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Baker for some business . 
 Would 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning be alright ? 

Who will meet you at the airport ? 
 Oh , then I will arrange one of my staff to meet you at the airport . 
 I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? 
 How did the business trip go ? 
 I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! 
 Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . 
 I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . 
 No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? 

Welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 Today I'll invite you to enjoy the seafood.Please make yourself at home . 
 I am running Chinese arts and crafts . 
 I hope to import some silk from Hangzhou to Germany . Can you help me ? 

Here's the schedule we've prepared . 
 Do you mind if we talk about your schedule tomorrow ? 
 And this is the schedule for Mrs . Watson . Eileen from our department will take care of her . 
 All right . I'll see you in the lobby tomorrow morning . 
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! 
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! 
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . 
 He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! 
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . 
 I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . 

I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . 
 Don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office foe a couple of days ? 
 I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm .

 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . 
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional .

 Settle down , Elvin . If you're not careful , you'll give our plan away . Zina's smart , you know . 
 I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . 
 To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . 
 You said it , not me . 
 Zina , why are you whispering ? 
 What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ? 
 We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . 

I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . 
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
 I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
 Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . 
 But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . 
 That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way . 
 Thanks very much and you're very eloquent .

 Really ? Can I order anything I want ? 

Hey , Benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ? 
 What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous . 
 Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . 
 First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . 
 Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . 
 And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . 
 I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . 
 OK , no problem . But you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time . 
 Ah , good morning , Mr . Smith . Nice to meet you . I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel . Do sit down . 
 Now , have you brought your curriculum vitae with you ? 
 Have you brought your certificates as well ? 
 Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience . 
 OK , so do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 
 Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently . 
 Thank you very much . I'm looking forward to your call . 
 I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . 
 Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . 
 I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted . 

I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . 
 Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
 Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
 Yes . I want to get a better job . 
 I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . 
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . 
 Thank you so much for your advice . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure . 
 6 . So we should give them special attention . Some of them don't have a good health . 
 2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare . 
 Yes , most of them think it's good . But , some people have different opinions . They consider we should arrange some challenging activities . 
 That's good . I'll tell them later . And what kind of medicine we should be prepared ? 
 OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . 
 Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 Why don't you find someone who is in the know . 
 Did you ask his former sectary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . 

May I come in , Mr Sun ? 
 Can I try later then ? 
 Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? 

Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . 
 Do you play any sports or games ? 
 And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? 
 And now ? 
 Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . 

It ’ s time for me to go now . 
 I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
 I ’ d rather you typed it . 
 I ’ d rather you told her . 
 He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . 
 Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . 
 That's all right . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I'm looking for a job . 
 What kind of information do you want ? 
 Wilson . 
 Steven Michael . 
 Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . 
 Twenty-one . 
 In California . 
 I'm single . 
 I was an office boy . 
 Thank you . 
 Only as a clerk in a store . 
 I'm a quick learner , Mr.Jenkins . 
 Yes , and I'm a very good driver . 
 Do I have to travel a lot ? 
 But how will I get to know the products ? 
 How much is the salary ? 
 How much commission do your consultants get ? 
 Well , I'm very interested in the job . 
 Thank you . 

Good morning . 
 I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . 
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . 
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 
 Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... 

Now , Mr.William , a little personal information first , are you married ? 
 What's your major ? 
 How long have you been study in German ? 
 And just one more question , would you like to be an interpreter ? 
 Very good , you can come here to work next month . 

Well , how was the interview ? 
 What did the woman ask you ? 
 Did she ask you any questions about your family ? 
 Did she tell you whether you would get the job ? 

Hello . Is Bob there , please ? 
 Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ? 
 Can I leave a message please ? 
 Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I went to Yale University . 
 I have a B . A . in Economics . 
 I'm twenty-seven . 
 Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last five years . 
 I got $ 500 a week . 
 I ’ Ve looked over your resume , ms.Jane . I see you ’ Ve already have quite a lot of experience in secretary work , could you tell me something about your talent with that company ? 
 En ? 
 You like that work ? 
 Why do you want to leave the company ? 

Hello , may I speak to Mr.Baker , please ? 
 This is Jones . Can I leave a message ? 
 Please tell him to call Mr.Baker at the Grand Restaurant . It's urgent . 
 Thank you . 

Good morning ! 
 Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged . 
 I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . 
 I really can't say how long she'll be . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . 

Can you type , Jane ? 
 How many words a minute ? 
 En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ? 
 Really ? that ’ s very good . What about French ? 
 ... Can you start next week ? 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now . 
 I will if you tell me how you're so sure that we're going to come out on top . 
 After what you did , I don't know how hard Elvin's going to work to meet your deadline . 
 You've got everyone figured out , don't you ? 

I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position . 
 No , but I can write very fast . 
 No , but I ’ d like to learn how to use them . 
 Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ? 
 I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . 
 Then you've heard from Vital ? 
 Look , Vince . I didn't mean to step on your toes , but we need to be decisive . 
 This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . 

I don't make idle threats . 
 I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . 
 If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . 
 I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ? 
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? 
 Yes . But why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . 
 Of course . 
 I have a plan for handling WebTracker . Step one is the Stars.com contract . 
 Don't worry about that , Dave . Look , I have to see Vince now . Think about what I said . 
 When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? 
 I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . 

Hi , boss . You wanted to see me ? 
 Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . 
 You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I'm looking for a job . 
 What kind of information do you want ? 
 Wilson . 
 Steven Michael . 
 Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . 
 Twenty-one . 
 In California . 
 Thank you . 
 Only as a clerk in a store . 
 I'm a quick leamer , Mr.Jenkins . 
 Yes , and I'm a very good driver . 
 Do I have to travel a lot ? 
 But how will I get to know the products ? 
 How much is the salary ? 
 How much commission do your consultants get ? 
 Well , I'm very interested in the job . 
 Thank you . 

Can I leave early today ? 
 And can I come in late tomorrow ? 
 And may I take Friday off ? 
 One more thing . Would you give me a ten-dollar raise ? 

Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ? 
 Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock . 
 Robert . Philips Robert . 
 Er , good morning , yes , er ... 
 Oh , yes.Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? 
 Really , hmmmm.Erm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ? 
 Where exactly have you been working , please ? 
 Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . 
 Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . 
 I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... 
 That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . 
 That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery . 
 I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . 
 That sounds all right . 

No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job . 
 I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . 
 Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . 
 Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . 
 Sure ... what's up ? 
 Sure ... 
 Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... 
 Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? 
 Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . 
 Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . 
 Interesting idea . You might be on to something . 
 When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . 
 The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . 
 We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . 
 Good . I'll take care of it . 
 Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ? 
 OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin . 

Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ? 
 What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No ! 
 But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ? 

Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ? 
 It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor . 
 I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy . 

I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music . 
 I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . 
 He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . 
 No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince . 
 So you knew it was me ? 
 Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . 
 So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? 

My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . 
 It's business , Dave . 
 Right . The faint of heart should not apply . 
 So do I . 
 Like who ? 
 I've got it under control . 
 What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? 

Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? 
 Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . 
 I guess we'd better get back to work . 
 Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . 
 You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . 
 Elvin stopped by to see me . 

Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise . 
 Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . 
 That doesn't matter . I want at least 4 percent . 
 and what if it doesn't work out , right ? 
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? 
 Because I won't let it fail . 

I'm really confused , Zina . Will you explain all this to me ? 
 Yes . If we get it , we'll really be set for success . 
 OK , I'm with you so far . 

Hi , Jeny.Are still working ? 
 So , you are leaving , aren't you ? 
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? 
 Excuse me for taking your time . 

Excuse me sir.May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I 
 But it's true . 
 That's coincidence 。 
 I promise I will . 

Jack ! You've really done it this time . 
 I told you to get this consignment out last week.We can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? What am I going to do with you ? 
 Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ? 
 Bingo ! 
 Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ? 
 OK , I'll tell him . 
 Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? 
 Engaged.Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? 
 How long do you think she'll be ? 
 Can I leave a message , please ? 
 Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ... 
 That's very kind of you.How soon do you really need them ? 
 I'll try . 

John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . 
 No.Come here right now . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Why ? I work very hard . 
 Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . 
 It's unfair . 
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . 

Hello . Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . It'll be at three o'clock this afternoon . 
 Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? 
 How about Friday afternoon ? 

Hello , I wish to speak to Mr.Zhang . 
 Oh , how do you do , Mr.Zhang ? This is Mary speaking , I have a present for you from Wu of Beijing . 
 Mr.Wu had told me that you were coming to Changchun . May I call on you at your hotel tomorrow ? 
 Great . Then I'll be at your hotel at two . 
 How could I get there ? 
 what's your room number ? 
 I'll do that , Mr.Zhang , See you tomorrow . 

Morning , Tom . 
 You seem to be in a hurry . 
 Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then . 
 See you later . 
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 
 There are people everywhere.What ' s that girl doing ? 
 And what about that man there ? 
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers . 

Well , tell me something of yourself . 
 What working experience have you got ? 
 Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? 

May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I'm quiting . 
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . 
 Very well , consider me gone . 
 First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record.Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business . 
 I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Yes . Are the chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ? 
 That would be good . 
 That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? 
 That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? 
 Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . 
 Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 

What kind of job are you interested in ? 
 I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . 
 Have you had any experience as a guide ? 
 Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . 

Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff.and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? 

Hi , my name is Tom . 
 Nice to meet you too.Melinda . 
 Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . 
 It looks like you guys work hard . 
 Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 

Mary , could you please come in for a short while ? 
 Mary , I'd like you to meet Richard , Our new executive in the marketing . 
 Welcome to our department . I hope you'll like it here . 
 Sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me . 
 Richard , Mary is a very helpful and experienced secretary indeed , and I'm sure you will find out . 

What sort of experience do you have ? 
 Where was your last job ? 
 Why did you quit your last job ? 

Good morning.My name's Pat Green . 
 I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant . 
 I think so.But before I apply , could you tell me more about the work ? 
 I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school . 
 How many hours would I work a day and what's the pay ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 

Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager . 
 I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese . 
 It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . 
 I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , A great oak needs deep roots . I ’ m really interested in this job . 

What a busy week ! 
 Right.How are you going to spend your weekend ? 
 Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ? 
 You should try it.It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too.What do you say ? 
 That was a pretty good shot , Mary . 
 Let me help you with your serve . 
 Of course , you can.All you need is a little help and a lot of practice . 
 Well , maybe not a Michael Zhang , but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ? 

How about your study at college ? 
 Why did you select your college ? 
 What do you like doing in your spare time ? 

Why did you apply for the position ? 
 What do you hope to become ? 
 Well , thank you for coming.We ' ll let you know as soon as possible . 
 My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? 
 Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . 
 Twenty . 
 Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . 
 English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . 
 Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . 
 I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . 
 I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . 

Good morning . My name is John Smith . I'm an import manager . 
 Nice to meet You , Ms . Thou . We've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products . 
 Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we 
 So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America . 
 Sure . 
 Is that so ? 
 Have you decided ? 
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I'm sure something can be worked out . 
 OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
 Yes , I would . 
 What's that building opposite us ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Oh , really ? 

Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? 
 Are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
 I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . 
 How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . 

We have achieved great success last year.The most important is that we realize our strength lies in after-sale service . 
 What we will do is to strengthen it . 

This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . 
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . 
 What's your proposal ? 
 Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! 
 The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . 
 OK . We can meet halfway again . 
 Can You tell me how many you want to buy ? 
 Well . then , 260 yuan each . 
 I'm afraid we can't go as high as that . You know we usually don't give any discount . but considering the newly established business relationship between us , I could give you 3 % off the list price . 
 OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ? 

Here's our sample room . 
 Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ? 
 Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require . 
 You are welcome to have a try . Here it is . Ours is of prime quality . 

I was told that your company had been in the furniture industry for many years . What kinds of products do you generally handle ? 
 You know , we want to totally furnish our new office building . This is a list of what we need . Could you give me a ballpark figure for everything on this list ? 
 If the furniture is pleasantly designed and high-quality stuff , we intend to buy several thousand sets . 
 I hope you will make us your best offer , CIF New York . 
 Oh it was really good . Do you know , he ’ s the nicest boss I ’ Ve had here . 
 What ’ s more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! 
 I hope so . Then I ’ ll be the happiest person in our office too ! 
 Yes . We're satisfied with the result . 

We look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future . 
 I hope you'll see that we are really doing our utmost . 
 We are interested in this field . 

We hope that our cooperation will continue . 
 We do think so . 
 Yes . I promise it will not happen again . 
 We will inform you as soon as possible . 
 We hope that this dispute can be settled through friendly negotiation without its being submitted for arbitration . 

We are sorry for our fault . 
 Thank you for your understanding . 
 That's nice . 
 Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . 
 Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . 
 No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 I can speak the language better than I read and write . 
 I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 
 I have many hobbies . I like most all kind of sports , and I also like to listen to classic musics . 
 Football.It ' s a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and I also enjoying the team spirit of football . 
 Yes . I enjoying reading biographs , especially those of well-known statesmen , militarists , scientist and artists , I can learn a lot from their life histories . 
 I like the novels of Dickens very much , I have reading almost all of them in Chinese translation , I wish i can reading them in the original . 
 I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . 
 I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better . 
 People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . 
 I graduated from Peking University . 
 I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China . 
 I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work . 
 I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . 
 Yes . I have been a data entry operator for three years . 
 I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos.Actually , I'm quite familiar with both Java and C Programming Languages . 
 I have an ACRE certificate , GRADE 2 . 
 I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information , but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly.It can't be too difficult , and I've got a quick mind . I can handle any problem you give me . 
 Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . 
 I mostly did advertising planning . 
 I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . 
 The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . 
 I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . 
 Because I ’ m very competent in this area . 
 Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . 
 I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . 
 Yes , I would like to . 

Mr . Smith , do you like the hotel we booked ? 
 I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one . 

Now please tell me something about your past work achievements . 
 That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ? 
 Have you received any honors ? 
 Do you have any publications ? 

That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored . 
 Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory . 
 Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing . it ’ s the most important thing to me . 
 Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . 
 Yes , of course . 
 In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . 
 By doing whatever is necessary . 
 You're going out of your way for us , I believe . 

Mr . Smith , welcome to our factory . 
 You'll know our products better after this visit . 
 OK . Let me see . 

What's that ? 
 Oh . 

Is there any way of ensuring we'll have enough time for our talks ? 
 So our evenings will be quite full then ? 

An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown . 
 Sorry , what was your last name again ? 
 OK . I'm Dick . 

Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Oh , dear ! 
 How do you do ? 

Hello . Is Vanessa there ? 
 Hi , Vanessa . I ’ m Don . I ’ m calling from Seller ’ s Market . Are you still interested in a position as a cashier ? 
 Yes , it is . Please come to see me tomorrow afternoon at 2 00 for a job interview . 
 You ’ re welcome . I ’ ll see you tomorrow at 2 00 . 

Hello . Can I speak to Kevin , please ? 
 My name is Joan Harris . I ’ m calling from St . Johns Hospital . Are you still interested in a job as a service technician ? 
 I have good news for you.You ’ Ve got an interview . Can you come to the Human Resources Office on Thursday at 9 30 am ? 
 345 Stony Creek Avenue . 
 Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 . 
 Really ? Where did you hear that ? 
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . 
 That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . 
 Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . 
 Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . 
 I'm from Germany . 
 Yeah , but I can speak English , too . 
 A little French . 

Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ? 
 Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . 
 Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . 
 Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . 
 Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . 
 Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . 

Good morning , Mr . Smith . 
 It is 9 o'clock now . 
 You have two meetings today . One is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . After the meeting , you will have dinner with Mr . Brown at the Chinese restaurant in Sister Hotel . 
 No problem . Do you need the OHP ? 
 OK . Do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ? 

Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 

In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . 
 Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . 
 Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ? 
 Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university . 
 Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 . 

Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . 
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? 
 He is then in a very difficult situation . 

Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask some things about work for this company ? 
 I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff.Is that true ? 
 If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? 
 Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime.Is that true ? 
 It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . 
 I am , sir . 
 Yes , sir . 
 You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! 
 Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best . 
 Your major must be computer . 
 Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . 
 Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . 
 Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . 

Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 

How will you ship the order ? 
 But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price . 
 I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company # for approximately 10 years . 
 I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating systems . 
 I see myself in a management position . 
 It's hard to say . But why ? 
 I can understand your position . We can not make any promise , but we'll try our best . 
 If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . 
 It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . 
 We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports . 
 As most of our clients are near Tianjin , we'd like to appoint Tangle as the unloading port . 
 This weekend . 
 Don't worry about that.We have experience . 
 About 3 weeks . 
 By the end of this month , at the latest . 
 I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? 
 Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . 
 Let me check.Well , in October . 
 We assure you that shipment will be made no later than the first half of October . 
 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . 
 I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of the branch office ? 
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? 
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . 
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . 
 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazine . 

If we give you the job , what ’ s the most important thing you except to get ? 
 Just this ? 
 Do you want to get a promotion ? 
 Where would you like to be in 5 years ? 
 How do you plan to accomplish this ? 

Well , tell me something of yourself . 
 What working experience have you get ? 
 Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? 

What is your great struck ? 
 Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? 
 Can you working under pressure ? 
 Are you more a follower or a leader ? 

Billy , you are late again . 
 Yes he ' s in his office . 
 Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . 
 I think he might . You'd better go to his office . 
 Good luck ! 
 B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . 
 B :: Thank you . 
 B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . 
 Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof . 
 Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! 
 The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! 
 Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” Wild Things ” ? ! 

How do you think the report I wrote ? 
 I jumped the gun . 
 Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . 
 With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . 
 Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? 

So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? 
 And how do you like working for IBM ? 
 What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? 
 That ’ s good . We always need team players here . 
 The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . 

Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . 
 That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . 

I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . 
 You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? 
 But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . 
 You need all your receipts for reimbursement . 
 Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . 
 It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But now it ’ s the evening rush . 
 Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . 
 I have done something like that before . 
 I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home . 
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . 
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . 

We need to know whether you have the special training . 
 How about your experience ? 

We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances . 
 So you're quite confident in your experience and skill 

May I have your resume , please ? 
 Do you like a job in a library , working with books ? 

One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . 
 He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . 
 Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . 

Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . 
 I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? 
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 

Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . 
 This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . 

My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? 
 How ? 
 Very useful advice , I will try them right now . 
 I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . 
 I really appreciate it . Thank you . 
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . 
 No problem . Good luck . 

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? 
 Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . 
 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . 

You look really wiped out ? 
 Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . 

Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? 
 Thanks , Vivian . 

Hi , still in the office ? It ’ s already 7 . 
 Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? 
 Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? 

Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? 
 Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? 
 Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? 

Did you punch in ? 
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 
 Sure , when those never ending meetings . 
 What do you need ? 
 He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . 
 Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . 
 I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . 
 Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . 
 I will do my best . 
 What do you mean ? 

What is your most preferred training method ? 
 Well , that is also very efficient , right ? 
 That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . 
 No , really ? 
 Who will be there ? 
 That is good . He can leave you alone this time . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Anything that distracts you from work ? 
 Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? 

How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? 
 Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . 
 Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . 
 If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . 
 But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . 

How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 

I am thinking about resigning from my current job . 
 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . 
 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . 
 Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . 
 I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . 
 Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening . 
 Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda 
 I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? 
 Yes , there is . See you then . 
 What is the problem ? 
 It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . 

I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . 
 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I've got to be there , right ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . 
 If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . 

What sort of job would you like to take ? 
 We need an operator now . 

You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . 
 I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . 
 Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . 

I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . 
 It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? 
 Certainly . 
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . 
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? 
 Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 
 Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . 
 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . 
 Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . 
 What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . 
 Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . 

Which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ? 
 Then how about a salesman ? 

I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . 
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . 
 Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . 

Is the view going to be ok ? 
 I ’ ll do my best . 

I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . 
 I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . 

Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project . 
 Then I'll see you in the afternoon . 

I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . 
 Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . 

We did a survey on your job performance . 
 Not so good . Lots of complains . 
 Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . 
 Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . 
 I'm sure you'll pass it . 
 Hi , I was just coming to see you.But since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first . 
 Well , I can try , what do you need ? 
 Sure , no problem.But I need something from you . 
 I'm supposed to have this package ready for mailing out tomorrow morning and I'm miles away from being ready.Can you edit this product study I wrote while I do these ? 
 That works for me . 
 Here's a print out of the study , and this is a disc with the full report on it.The file name is product study , this is and extra copy so you can do whatever you want with it . 
 I agree . 
 I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . 
 Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . 
 Shoot ! 
 I don't see a problem . 

Both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position 
 Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? 

Hi , Bill.It ' s Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd.How are you ? 
 Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute ? 
 We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid . 
 Right , this is not a drill . This is for all the marbles . 
 ASAP , in writing of course . 
 The usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil . 

Good morning . I ’ m Mickey Huang , I have an appointment with Mr wilson . 
 That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm fine . Thank you . 
 Let me see . Would it be all right on Wednesday morning ? 
 Then I will see you in my office at ten Wednesday morning . 
 I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . 
 Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . 
 About two years now . 
 Yes.Would tomorrow morning be all right with you ? 
 I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ? 
 Yes , of course.When ? 
 Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then . 
 Sorry to hear that . 
 Fine , we'll be expecting you then . 
 I'm afraid I won't be free next week . 
 That's OK . 
 This is he . 
 All right . 
 When can I go to see him ? 
 OK . 
 What a pity ! 
 That's OK . 
 Thanks . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work . 
 If you don't mind , let's make it a little later.What about three or four ? 
 All right . 
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! 
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! 

I don't think I can manage this morning . I wonder if we could after the time of meeting to tomorrow afternoon . 
 All right.Thank you . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . 
 Sure , but this week is crazy for me . Can we make it next Monday ? 
 That's fine . See you then . 
 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . 
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . 
 I can't . I am really behind of my work . 
 Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please . 
 This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . 
 We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr.Chen will know why I'm calling . 

Good afternoon , CCL press.Jennisse speaking , How can I help you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Mr.Li is in a meeting right now . Can I take a message ? 
 Nigel Smith . Does he have your number , Mr . Smith ? 
 2781703 1 . Sure . I'll make sure he gets the message . 

Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? 
 Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! 
 Look ! He has a partner ! 
 Gross ! 
 But I think Eddy is going too far ! 
 Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! 

Oh . It looks like Jack is going to make his annual speech . 
 Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ? 
 No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating ! 
 All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! 
 I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that . 
 Yeah , that sounds right . 
 Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that . 
 That's him ! 
 I appreciate your help . 
 Here's my card . 

Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? 
 Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? 
 The accounts department , I think . 

Look ! They're going to do the first drawing ! It's for a DVD player ! 
 They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats ! 
 Hmm ... Darryl doesn't look like the red underwear type ... 
 The kitchen god ? What does he do ? 
 Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! 
 What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? 
 Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . 
 His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! 
 Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! 
 Can we just sit wherever we want ? 
 Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? 
 Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! 
 I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! 
 Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? 
 I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . 
 He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . 
 The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . 
 Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . 
 Yes . He usually replies immediately . 
 My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him . 
 And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! 
 Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . 
 A lousy desk lamp . And you ? 
 Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! 

This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . 
 Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... 

Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . 
 Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . 
 Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . 
 Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . 
 " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " 
 Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . 
 Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! 
 We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . 
 Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . 
 Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . 
 That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . 
 Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . 
 I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! 
 Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . 
 Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! 
 Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . 

I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . 
 Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . 
 Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . 

Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? 
 I see . And how about the working hours ? 
 Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . 
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? 
 That sounds ideal . 
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . 
 I hope to hear from you very soon . 

Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . 
 Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . 
 Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also . 
 Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . 
 Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . 
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . 
 Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . 
 I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . 
 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! 
 Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! 
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . 
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . 
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . 
 Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . 
 Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . 
 Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . 
 Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . 

So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . 
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . 
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! 
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . 

Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . 
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . 
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . 
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? 

So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? 
 You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
 I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! 
 Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal . 
 How ’ s Thursday ? Does she have any time available then ? 
 Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday . Can she do Tuesday ? 
 Sure , Merton Financial Advisors . 

Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . 
 But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . 
 Ok . Anything else ? 
 Um yeah . Sorry about that . 
 Is that so ? 
 Have you decided ? 
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out . 
 OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
 Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , but why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I'd delighted if you did . 
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . 
 OK . 
 I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . 
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . 
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . 
 We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . 
 All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . 
 It's interesting , I like being an editor . 
 I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . 
 I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . 
 No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? 
 That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 
 Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . 
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
 Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . 
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . 
 I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . 
 Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . 
 Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . 
 Come in , please . 
 In 3 months or so . 
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . 
 I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . 

Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . 
 Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . 
 The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . 
 Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . 
 I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . 
 Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . 
 I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! 
 That's right , I have to work . 
 How do you do ? 
 I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province . 
 Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? 
 Oh , Thank you very much ! 
 Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . 
 Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over there is the sales department . 
 Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
 I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices--the managers ' offices . 
 Sure thing . 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I'll go get some . Then you need to send the file . Make sure you choose the right printer . We have a few here and you're hooked up to all of them . 
 It's the Canon . 
 Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? 
 That ’ s fine . Thanks for coming to see us . I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week . 
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 
 There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ? 
 And what about that man there ? 
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees . 

To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ? 
 Do you have any questions about the job ? 
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . 

I came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson . 
 My name is Woody . 
 Because I admire your company . Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city . 
 Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman . 
 Thanks . 
 I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . 
 Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . 
 Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . 
 I think I would like that . 
 Yes . I have been a data entry operator for three years . 
 I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos . Actually , I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages . 
 Yes , I have an ACRE certificate , Bank 2 . 
 I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information , but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly . It can't be too difficult , and I've got a quick mind . I can handle any problem you give me . 
 I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . 
 Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . 
 I expect to work hard , madam . 
 No , I enjoy travelling . 
 Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . 
 I mostly did advertising planning . 
 I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . 
 The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . 
 I have many hobbies . I like almost all kind of sports , and I also like to listen to classical musics . 
 Football . It's a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and I also enjoying the team spirit of football . 
 Yes . I enjoying reading biographs , especially those of well-known statesmen , militarists and artists , I can learn a lot from their life histories . 
 I like the novels of Inches very much , I have reading almost all of them in Chinese translation , I wish i can reading them in the original . 
 I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . 
 I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better . 
 People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . 
 I graduated from Peking University . 
 I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China . 
 I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work . 
 I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . 
 All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % . 
 I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future . 
 Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 . 
 Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily . 
 Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . 
 No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 I can speak the language better than read and write . 
 I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . 
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . 
 Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . 
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . 
 I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . 
 Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school . 
 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student newspaper , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . 
 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . 
 Yes , okay . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English . 
 My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? 
 Thank you , Miss Kelly . 
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . 
 Yes , I would . 
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . 

Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... 
 Certainly . And after your internship ? 
 Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ? 
 The London Weekly right ? 

Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . 
 Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . 
 Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? 
 Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
 I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 
 I have always enjoyed flying . And I am good with people . 
 Yes , I can adjust to anything . 
 I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid . 
 Thank you . It has always been my dream to be a stewardess . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Would you please tell me about your pay skill first ? 
 They sum my skills and experience . I ’ d like to start it with 4000 yuan a month . 
 Do I have paid vacation ? 

Do you have any other questions ? 
 According to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months . 
 In this period , you can only get the basic salary , 2,500 yuan per month . 
 The salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month . Your salary will be raised every year in October , depending on your performance . 
 Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year . 
 No , thank you . 
 That would be great . 
 I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ? 
 I need it delivered at 12 . 
 That's not a problem ? 
 That's great ! Thank you very much . 
 Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . 
 A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time . 
 Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ? 
 Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ? 

Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ? 
 Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ? 
 That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ? 
 Thank you . 
 Your major must be computer . 
 Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . 
 Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . 
 Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . 

We ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . 
 That ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done . 
 I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . 
 That ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . 
 Good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . 
 I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . 

Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask some things about work for this company ? 
 I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . Is that true ? 
 If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? 
 Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . Is that true ? 
 It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . 
 I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . 
 It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . 
 Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . 
 We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable . 

Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . 
 That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . 
 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . 
 You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week . 
 You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? 
 Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . 
 That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . 
 Sure . Where shall I begin ? 
 I went to the university of Ohio , in America . 
 I got a bachelor ’ s degree . 
 I majored in English and minored in Chinese . 
 I graduated with honors . I had a 3.9 . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to obtain a master ’ s degree in international relations . 
 After I have 3-4 years of work experience . 

I ’ m interested in teaching at your school . 
 Yes . 
 I have a TEFL certificate . 
 I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . 
 I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . 
 Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . 
 Yes , just a little . 
 I sure can . 

What did you do at the office today ? 
 What kind of things did you need to check ? 
 I see . Did anything else happen ? 
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . 
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? 
 You certainly had a busy day . 

What kind of work do you want to do when you finish university ? 
 That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon . 
 Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . 
 I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field . 
 That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? 
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . 
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? 
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? 

Sandy , can you help me contact these people ? 
 Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes . 
 They are all listed here on this sheet of paper . 
 Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers . 
 Then , you should e-mail them with the information . 
 They should have then listed on their resumes . 
 Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . 
 Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . 
 I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . 
 I told her that she should call me back at my office number . 
 Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . 
 Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card . 
 Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday . 

John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . 
 He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . 
 He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . 
 He is in his late thirties . 
 At 2 thirty . 
 Hi , Navy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . 
 yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . 
 That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? 
 All right I'll read it soon . 
 Oh . It's nothing Navy . 
 Mike , you're late again . 
 Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
 Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 
 You'd better . 
 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? 
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? 
 It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . 
 It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours . 
 Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane . 
 That will be very nice . You're too kind . 
 Sounds great . Thank you for your hospitality . 
 Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . 
 I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ? 
 Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ? 
 Thank you very much . 

I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? 
 What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . 
 What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . 
 You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? 
 I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . 

Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me . 
 This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? 
 Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . 
 It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . 
 They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? 
 Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . 
 Yes.Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm . 
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . 
 When will we get one of those ? 

Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
 You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . 
 The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 

Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging . 
 Of course , can you leave your name and number ? I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . 
 Can you tell me what it's about ? I can make a note of it , so Mr . Nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call . 

Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . 
 Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? 

Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? 
 Ok . 
 It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM . 

I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . 
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 
 Sure . 
 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . 
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? 
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . 

ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? 
 Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ? 
 It is urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly . 

Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ? 
 Sure . Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you . Would you be interested in taking part in an interview ? It is scheduled some time within this week . 
 Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . 
 You ’ re welcome . Bye . 
 Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . 
 Bye . 
 We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... 

Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith . 

Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? 
 Thanks , Vivian . 

Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? 
 I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . 
 Yes , I will need it . Thanks . 
 Where are you ? 
 Ok . 
 Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . 
 Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . 

Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? 
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . 
 Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . 
 I know , but I am really sick . 
 I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas 
 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . 
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . 

Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . 
 This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . 

Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? 
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 
 That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . 
 Ok , good luck to you . 
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . 
 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . 
 I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 
 Mr . Smith , please . 
 What time do you expect him back then ? 
 No , thanks . I will call back later . 
 OK . Thank you . Goodbye . 
 We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? 
 Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . 
 We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? 
 Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . 

If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . 
 Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . 
 That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . 
 How did I do ? 
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . 

I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . 
 That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . 
 About 3-4 % of the gross sales . 
 That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . 
 It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . 
 Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . 
 There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . 

I ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . 
 I ’ m interested in your hardware . I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada . Here is a list of my requirements , for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , C . I . F . Vancouver . 
 I ’ ll do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? 
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . 
 You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . 

How do I submit an expense report ? 
 You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? 

Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! 
 After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? 
 The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . 
 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. 
 We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . 
 No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . 
 What do you need ? 
 He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . 
 Here you are . Do you need glue ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? 
 So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? 

I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? 
 We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . 
 Good . Do I have a second ? 
 motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? 
 What kind of action is required ? 

Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? 
 How long is my paid vacation every year ? 
 What about the insurance and housing policies ? 
 How often is the bonus ? 
 Do I have training opportunities ? 
 Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . 
 Ok , thank you for your time and patience . 

Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . 
 Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! 
 It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . 
 Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . 

What's our target audience for this campaign ? 
 Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
 Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? 

What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? 
 What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... 
 Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? 
 Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? 

How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
 Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . 

What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . 
 I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . 
 We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . 
 Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . 
 Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . 
 It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . 
 Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . 
 But by then , the technology will be outdated . 
 That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . 
 I guess you get what you pay for . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 

Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . 
 Really ? What could that be ? 
 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 
 Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . 
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? 
 Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . 
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . 
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . 
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . 

I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . 
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . 
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? 

May I speak to Mr . Smith ? 
 What time do you expect him back ? 
 Ok , I have the number . Bye ! 
 Sorry , I can ’ t hear you . Could you please speak up a little ? 
 Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ’ t hang up please . I ’ ll have the call transferred to another line . 
 Would you like some coffee or tea ? 
 How would you like your coffee ? 
 Coffee will be right with you . 
 Hi , Lucy , are you free to talk ? 
 Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail . 

May I speak to Mr . Thomas ? 
 I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him 

Thank you for calling ABC Company , may I help you ? 
 Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? 
 He is on the line . 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 

We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . 
 Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? 
 Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . 
 I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . 
 I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . 
 I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 
 I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 Did you get the position you wanted ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! 
 Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! 

Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? 

It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview . 
 We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . 
 Goodbye . 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . 
 Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . 
 At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . 
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 Yes , it will print immediately . 
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . 
 Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 

I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . 
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? 

Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? 
 These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . 
 It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . 
 Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . 
 Yes , it ’ s right . 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
 You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 

Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 I think I can handle it by myself . 
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
 Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . 

We have the orientation this afternoon . 
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . 
 Yes , it is not easy . 

Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . 
 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . 
 Done . Here is my paper . 
 What about the 3rd round ? 

What ’ s up ? 
 Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? 
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . 
 You can send a compressed one . 
 Why , what's the lowdown ? 
 I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . 

Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? 
 Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . 
 Thank you very much . 

How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . 
 Ok . 
 No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . 
 The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . 
 Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . 
 No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . 
 If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . 
 We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . 
 I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . 

Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? 
 Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . 
 Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . 
 Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . 
 In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? 
 First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . 
 I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . 
 I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . 
 That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . 
 The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . 
 Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . 
 In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . 
 Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . 
 Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . 
 Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . 

What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? 
 What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? 
 For example ? 

Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . 
 I ’ m calling to see if you have made your decision . You are the right person we are seeking for . 
 Good news for us . When can you start to work ? 
 Ok , please come to my office at 9 AM next Monday . I will introduce you to our boss . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? 
 What kind of considerations are we talking about ? 
 Our company now has n ombudsman ? 

Are you free next thursday ? 
 A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . 
 Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . 
 Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? 
 What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? 

Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . 
 I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? 
 Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . 
 We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . 
 We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . 
 Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . 
 You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . 
 Unless they're united , very little ... 
 You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? 
 What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? 

So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... 
 How many people are on the board of directors ? 

Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? 
 What's he studying ? 
 Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? 
 Why is that ? 

Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? 
 But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? 
 It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? 

Francis , what ’ s that ? 
 Could you tell me something about it ? 
 How many departments do we have ? 
 Ok . Who should I report to ? 

So , where can I start my work ? 
 And I represent ? 
 Ok , thank you . 

Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? 
 So , what experience do you have ? 
 I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? 
 I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? 
 I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? 

How long does it take to get to downtown from here ? 
 What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? 
 Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? 
 It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? 

Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . 
 Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . 
 I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... 
 There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . 
 We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . 
 We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . 
 No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... 
 Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? 
 No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . 

How can I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? 
 Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? 
 Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared 
 What news ? 
 You know what we will get ? 
 What docking station ? 
 Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . 
 You mean the network connection ? 
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 

Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . 
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . 

What ’ s up ? 
 Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? 
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . 
 You can send a compressed one . 
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . 
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . 
 Good idea . 
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 

I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 
 Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . 
 Ok , then we can sign up for it together . 
 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . 

Where were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . 
 Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 

Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . 
 Thank you . 
 Should each of us write separately ? 

I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . 
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . 
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? 

How long have you been in this company ? 
 You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 

Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 
 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
 But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . 

I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . 
 You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . 
 Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . 
 Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . 
 It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . 
 I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . 
 To visit our supplier ? 
 Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . 
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? 
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . 
 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . 
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! 
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . 
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 

Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 
 This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
 Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . 
 If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? 
 Can I see it for a second ? 
 Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . 
 Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? 
 The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... 

I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this . 

Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 I think I can handle it by myself . 
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
 Like this one ? 
 Yeah , thank you for telling me . 

Can you help me for a minute ? 
 I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person . 
 OK , So I first thanks them for their business , I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , How is that ? 
 Like Regarding our new product line , we would like to announce a special price discount 
 Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ? 

So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? 
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . 
 Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . 
 Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 

May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 
 Thank you for telling me that . 
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . 
 I got it . 
 I see . 
 Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? 
 How long will the tour take ? 
 Okay ... 

Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? 
 You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . 
 I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . 

Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . 
 Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . 
 This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? 
 Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! 

May I help you ? 
 Let me key in your information into my computer . I will pull up our records for you . Do you have an order number ? What name is the order listed under ? 
 Yes , Mr . Smith . I have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ? 
 Is there the correct billing address ? 
 I will send you an invoice in the next few days . Your order should be delivered before the end of the day on Monday . 

Hello , thank you for calling Bradford and Sons . This is Tracy speaking , How may I help you ? 
 Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk.May I tell her who is calling ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Burton.Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available . 
 I'm sorry , Ms.Jenkins is away from her desk.She has already left for lunch.Would you like to leave a message for her ? 
 Oh , that's right . You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow . I know there are some things I need to share with you about that . But , gosh , I don't know ... Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ... 
 It's okay ... I've already had several days in a row working through lunch ... 
 You don't have to do that ... 
 Actually I do like Chinese ... Let's make it a date for Chop Suey and the Martin account at about twelve thirty . Does that sound good ? 

Hello ! 
 This is Doris . Who's calling please ? 
 Oh , I almost forgot . Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early . 
 It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ? 
 That ’ s alright , . I think I should be able to make it at one fifteen . Can you put me down for that time slot ? 
 Wonderful . Thanks very much . 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 

This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .

 At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . 
 Yes , Sir . 
 All right , who should I send them to ? 
 Ok , home or office address ? 
 Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 

Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 

Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
 What are they ? 
 And what is the most important point ? 

I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . 
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? 

I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . 
 Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 

Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy . There are some figures I want to check . 
 Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . 
 Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper . 

Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 

Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month . 
 I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion .

 Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see , is that our expenses are through the roof .

 The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! 
 Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? !

Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 
 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . 
 But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? 
 Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . 
 Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 . 
 Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business 
 Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . 
 Sure . 
 No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .

 Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? 

Hello . Is this Ann ? 
 Yes , it's me . 
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . 
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . 
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . 
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . 

Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there .

 No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . 
 Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? 
 Will this be debit or credit ? 
 Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . 
 No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ...

 Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ? 
 Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye . 

Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? 
 Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . 
 It was always very busy there . 
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . 
 Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . 
 No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . 
 I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutical company . 
 Mostly office work - filing and so on . 
 Till the end of the month . 
 I hope they ’ re not too hard ! 
 I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . 
 I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . 
 Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye . 
 Yes . When I saw the advertisement I thought it would really suit me . 
 I think that I'll be really good at this kind of work . In fact I learn so fast that I'll be looking for promotion very shortly . 
 A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments . 
 I suppose I'm a reasonable student . I passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me . 
 Maths and chemistry were my favorite subjects at school . I also enjoyed history . 
 Well , I've thought about doing the part-time Chemistry Certificate course at Technical College . I think I would really benefit from doing that . 
 Yes . I have worked part-time at a take away food store-the one just round the corner . 
 Well , I've found out a lot about this type of work and my research suggests that I would be quite capable of doing the work involved . I also think that I would be able to handle any training course reasonably well . 
 Thank you . When will I know if I am successful ? 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . 
 Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . 
 Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . 

Okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job ! 
 So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? 
 So what would your role in the company ? 
 Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? 
 You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? 
 Thank you . 
 Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . 
 Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service . 
 Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . 
 Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? 
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... 
 Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! 

So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? 
 You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
 I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! 
 Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? 
 You wanna take some time off , is that right ? 
 What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . 
 Well , I guess so . 
 I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . 
 I can type 100 Chinese words a minute and take dictation in English at 150 words a minute . 
 Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines . 
 That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ? 
 Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question . 
 What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ? 
 Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position . 
 I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ? 
 No . Thank you for the time . 
 Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . 
 Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . 
 The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight . And good service is also important . 
 I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition . 
 Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital . 
 My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . 
 One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . 
 I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures . 
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . 
 Can I give her a message for you ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Certainly .

 Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ? 
 What kind of work are you doing now ? 
 What are your responsibilities in your present work ? 
 Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ? 
 Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? 
 What's the creditor's equity ? 

Come in , please . 
 Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . 
 I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? 
 Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? 
 From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . 
 You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . 
 That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? 
 Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ? 
 Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month . 
 I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . 
 The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . 

Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 Why are you interested in this occupation ? 
 What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess ? 
 Do you get angry easily ? 
 If a passenger had a accident , what would you do ? 
 If you are hired , when can you start work ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 

Do you have a free moment ? 
 I ’ m having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? 
 Silly me . 
 Oh , and it ’ s out of paper . Do you have any more ? 

What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How many years have you worked as a Production Manager ? 
 Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ? 
 Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ? 
 Then have you received any award at your present company ? 
 How would you evaluate the company you are with ? 
 How would your colleagues evaluate you ? 
 Can you get recommendations from your present employers ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 

Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
 Where do you want to be in 5 years ? 
 That sounds very reasonable . 
 If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? 
 Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . 
 What is your long-range objective ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? 

Do you have any work experience in this field ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 Does your current employer know you are looking for another job ? 
 What is your impression of your present company ? 
 What would your current colleague say about you ? 

Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ? 
 How do you plan to accomplish this ? 
 How long would you like to stay with this company ? 
 What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ? 

What is your salary at present ? 
 What are your salary expectations now ? 
 That's a little more than we had planned . 
 I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ? 

How long do you plan to stay here ? 
 How so ? 
 What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? 

How much do you expect to earn ? 
 If you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market . 
 Ok . 
 I expect to be paid according to my abilities . 
 That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . 
 By the way , how long is my probation ? 

Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on , what have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I ’ ll help you type one up . 

Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ? 
 Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks . 
 According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position . 
 My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language . 
 The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future . 
 Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . 
 Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ? 
 I see . This is my advantage . 
 No . 
 Thank you , bye-bye . 
 What do you want to know ? 
 Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . 
 That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . 
 Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . 
 More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . 
 Thanks very much . 
 Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ? 
 Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I . 
 From Video TV . 
 Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ? 
 It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 . 
 No , that's 447-9626 . 
 Yes , that's right . Extension 162 . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 

Mr.Sun , would you mind if I ask you some questions , which may sound impolite ? 
 Can you tell me how old you are ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Can you tell me something about your family ? 

Excuse me . May I see Mrs . Smith ? 
 Nice to meet you , Mrs . Smith . I'm coming here for an interview by appointment . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Not really , I am familiar with this area . 
 Yes , please . 
 Fine , thank you for coming . Mr . Wu , Please take a seat . I am Anne Smith , the assistant manager . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 My name is Sun lin . 
 I am twenty-five years old . 
 Yes , my birth date is September 22 , 1977 . 
 I live at 606 Zhongguancun Road , Apt 802 , Beijing . 
 My birthplace is Nanjing . 
 My domicile place is Nanjing , too . 
 Yes . Everything's all set . 
 We're supposed to be meeting alone . 
 Fine . But no one else , OK ? 

Tell me something about your work experience . 
 What systems have you worked on ? 
 Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ? 
 What do you consider your strengths ? 

Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ? 
 Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... 
 You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? 
 Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . 
 Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . 
 Oh , that ’ s easy . Go to yahoo.com . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope . 
 That one , the one that says , “ Mail . ” 
 Don ’ t worry . See where it says , “ New User ” ? 
 Click on that . 
 Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest . 
 Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . 
 Has anybody spoken to him about it ? 
 We can ’ t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? 
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? 
 With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . 
 Let ’ s rock n ’ roll . 
 If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk . 

We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . 
 You have some doubts about our products , I understand . 
 Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . 
 Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . 
 That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . 
 Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . 
 Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . 
 I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . 
 Yes . 
 Sure . What do you want to find ? 
 Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . 
 O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ” 
 Here , try this one . It ’ s a good site about Gettysburg . 
 For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . 

Hello , this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio . May I speak to Mr . Wilson please ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Wilson . I ’ m calling to confirm the date of the next interview program . 

Hello . Is this Ann ? 
 Yes , it's me . 
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . 
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . 
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . 
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . 

In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation . 
 Then what is your opinion ? 

Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied . 
 I'm afraid ... 

Could I have a word with you ? 
 I am disappointed with your work lately . 

What ’ s wrong ? 
 Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! 
 What happened ? 
 What are you going to do ? 

Please switch work shifts with me . 
 Why can't you ? 

Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? 
 Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . 

Hello ? 
 No , I ’ m afraid not , Mary . May I take a message for her ? 
 O . K . No problem . Anything else ? 
 All right , I ’ ll leave her the message , Mary . Thanks for calling . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company . 
 Well , Mark Smith , who was the first president , founded the company in Ottawa in 1955 . It has 1.5 billion dollars in capital.it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in Canada . 
 Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States , but particularly have sold very well here in China . So I think in the future you'll find China to be a profitable market as well . 
 Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 I think it is confidence in himself and his products . 
 Yes , I'd like to know something about the salary . 
 When can I get the final decision ? 
 Nice meeting you , too . Good-bye . 
 I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years . 
 I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . 
 For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area . 
 They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later . 
 I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . 
 My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . Most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged . 
 I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow . 
 One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime . 
 She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted . 
 I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity . 
 Yes , I do . What do you see as the future trends for the industry ? 
 I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ? 
 Have you got any selling experience at all ? 
 Now tell me about your educational background . 
 What courses have you completed ? 
 What subjects did you like most at university ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? 
 Good . Do you know anything about this company ? 
 Have you got anything to ask me ? 
 Yes . 
 Three times a year at most . How do you feel about this ? 

Tell me about yourself . 
 What type of position are you looking for ? 
 Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ? 
 Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? 
 What is your greatest strength ? 
 What is your greatest weakness ? 
 Why do you want to work for our company ? 
 When can you begin ? 

Tell me something about yourself and your past experience . 
 What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? 
 What attracted you to this job ? 
 What qualities do you think are important to this position ? 
 When have you been most motivated ? 
 Why did you leave your last position ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 

Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ? 
 Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? 
 Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday ! 

It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . 
 Yes . 
 So you must be an extravert ? 
 What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? 
 Don't you consider it a hard work ? 
 Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? 
 Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? 

Come in , please . 
 Good afternoon . Have a seat , please . You are Mr . Sun ? 
 I have read your resume . I know you have worked for 3 years . Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ? 
 What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ? 
 Why did you decide to apply for this position ? 
 What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours ? 
 We have several applicants for this position . Why do you think you are the person we should choose ? 
 That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ? 
 Have you anything to ask about the job ? 
 Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too . 
 Anything else ? 
 Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye . 

Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? 
 Great . Then what's your technical post title now ? 
 Do you take the original certificate with you ? 
 Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs ? 

Please tell me something about your insurance background . 
 Why do you want to be an insurance agent ? 
 Do you have any work experience in promotion ?

 Of course . 
 Ok , Mrs wang . I'll do that . 

Excuse me , could I ask a favour ? 
 Could you tell me where the canteen is ?

Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Who should I say is calling ? 
 And what is it regarding please ? 
 Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . 
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! 
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! 

Hey , Tom . I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It's for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on ! What have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I ’ ll help you type one up . 

Good morning . I ’ m Mickey Huang , I have an appointment with Mr wilson . 
 That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm fine . Thank you . 
 Glad to meet you , Mrs.Tina . 
 That's what I understand . 
 Exactly my understanding . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Just one . I noticed an item about flex-time.Is that a possibility for me ? 
 That's acceptable . 

I have a resume here . 
 David , Chou . 
 These are all my personal documents about my education and working experience you asked for . And I have to be off for an important meeting now . If you think I am right for the job , please keep me informed . 
 I am sorry , but I don't have one with me right now . 
 It's 687 3452 . 
 We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . 
 Yes , it is really hard . But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally . When you work , you can accumulate a lot of experience . Besides , you need to learn a lot of things while you are working . 
 But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . 
 You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . 
 Thank you . I ’ m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation . 
 Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . 
 Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ’ Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Brown . My name is Mrs . Anderson , manager of the sales department . 
 Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ? 
 What would you like , tea or coffee ? 
 Is it your first trip to the Fair , Mr . Brown ? 
 Good . Is there anything you find changed about the Fair ? 
 Really , Mr . Brown ? Did you find anything interesting ? 
 We are glad to hear that . What items are you particularly interested in ? 
 All right . 
 Certainly . Come to my office at ten ten . Be prompt , please . I've another appointment at 11 . 

Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . 
 Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . 

Some of them seem to be of the latest style . Now I ’ Ve a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish relations with you . 
 Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong , or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies . 
 That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry . 
 So do I . 
 This is Paula Blake , Mr . Simmons . How can I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . Just tell me your account number please . 
 That's quite all right . 
 Not too worry , so tell me about yourself . 
 It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life . 
 Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law . 
 I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . 
 Wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly . 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . 
 I'm not sure I can't agree , dan 
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 

So , are we all behind this new project ? 
 Ditto , it doesn't look too expensive either . 
 I can't see a problem . Let's give it a try . 
 It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ? 
 Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? 
 Here are our FOB price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . 
 As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . 
 We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . 
 Fine , thank you , and how are you ? 
 Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . 
 Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . 

Hi , Dan . What's new ? 
 I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ? 
 How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? 
 Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . 

Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? 
 Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? 
 The accounts department , I think . 

Hello , ABC company . 
 Just a moment . I am sorry . At the moment , he is out of the office . Would you like to leave your number ? When he comes back , I will tell him to call you back . 
 Of course . 
 I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ? 
 Is it urgent ? 
 Ok , I am coming . 
 Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? 
 All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . 
 Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? 
 You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 

Good afternoon , Mrs . White . 
 Can I see Mr . Cooper , your manager now ? 
 All right . 
 Thanks a lot , Mrs . White . 

Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name please ? 
 Alright ... And did you have some specific questions about your application ? 
 Oh , that's no problem . Just give me a moment , and I can check.Judy Liao . Let's see ... Yes , here it is . Judy Liao . We have received your resume . 
 Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 No , that is all we need . If we have those things included , that is sufficient . 
 I'm not really sure about that . But I know we are still receiving resumes.Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants . 
 If you have any further questions , you can call any time . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 I have a little experience . I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace . 
 Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . 
 No , this is my first . 
 I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ? 
 Yes . When can I get the decision ? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 

When will I get a raise ? 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I am quitting . 
 Yes , of course . What is it ? 
 Okay , what should I do ? 
 Yes , of course . I have to go there every Tuesday . 
 What's the presentation about ? 
 Will you need anything special for the presentation ? 
 I suppose you need the whiteboard set up . 
 Yes . One more is needed . 
 But do you have any experience like that ? 
 OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? 
 If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? 
 Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . 

This facility is great , don't you think ? 
 I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . 
 Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . 
 No . 
 Where do you go for lunch around here ? 
 Not too bad . But I will be soon . 
 I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? 
 Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . 
 Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . 
 When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? 
 Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? 
 Maybe . I will look around . 
 I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . 
 It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . 
 That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . 
 I'm sorry , sir . 
 Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . 
 But sir ... 
 I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . 
 No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . 
 You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . 
 I'm sorry , sir . 

Excuse me , can you tell me which is Bob Rice's office ? 
 Yes . He told me to come by this morning . 
 An appointment ? 
 He said I should come by this morning . He didn't give me a time.He said I could come any time before noon . 
 Today is Tuesday . 
 That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him . 
 Alright . 
 Friday is good . 
 Morning . 
 Yes . My name is Laura Wills . 
 Thank you . 

Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 So , you're a serious coffee drinker . 
 Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? 
 Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? 
 I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . 
 Yes . 
 What do you suggest ? 
 You mean because people have to go across town to get here . 
 That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . 
 I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . 
 Well . 
 You mean you want to run the meetings ? 
 Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . 
 I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . 
 I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " 
 Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ? 
 John eng 
 Well , I want to discuss with them the new control we said last week . 
 Yes , that will be easiest . 
 Yes , It's John eng .

 Then use the xerox machine .

 Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? 
 Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway .

 Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . 
 Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! 
 That ’ s about all I can spare , Karen . What do you need ? 
 She seems to be quite qualified . If it ’ s a personal problem , I ’ d prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves . 
 What ’ s the problem , Ms . Murphy ? 
 I ’ m sorry . Ms . Murphy . I ’ ll re-work it . Can I give it back to you this afternoon ?

 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Michael . Could you tell me where the problems are exactly ? Maybe I misunderstood the client ’ s intentions . 
 Thanks . I can wait here . 
 I see . All right , then . Thanks . 
 I ’ d be glad to . Just leave them on my desk . I didn ’ t expect you to finish so soon . 
 Great . Good work . 
 Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine . 
 Well , I ’ ll think about it . I don ’ t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase . 
 I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like . 
 Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jeff . Please don ’ t interrupt me right now . I ’ m in the middle of a conversation . 
 That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be finished in a little while . 
 Fine , Mr . Richardson . What do you have in mind ? 
 Yes ! I agree ! We could really use another one ! I ’ ll get on that right away ! What else would you like to order ? 
 Yeah . This is supply . What can I do for you ? 
 All right . No problem . What ’ s your extension ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . 
 You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . 
 Yeah , do you want something ? 
 No problem . Do you have any cash on you ? I don ’ t think I have enough . 
 Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . 
 All right , Mr . Jones . Do you think we ’ ll need anything else ? 
 I was supposed to do that ? I thought Sharon was responsible for that . 
 I ’ m really sorry , Mr . Samuel . I really don ’ t remember that . 
 I agree , Toni . I think the biggest problem we ’ re facing is how to bring it in under budget . 
 Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . 
 I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . 
 I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Douglas . 
 Oh , Kate ! I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind ! 
 Definitely . I ’ m really sorry ! 
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Let me look over them and I ’ ll bring them back this afternoon . 
 Yeah , I could tell that . That ’ s no problem . I can probably get it re-done by tomorrow . When ’ s our meeting with the boss ? 
 Then , we ’ Ve got plenty of time . 
 What do you mean , Janice ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Janice . But we ’ Ve been waiting on the client . It ’ s out of our hands at the moment . 
 Let me take a look . This is for a 486 computer with modem . Who ’ s it going to ? 
 Get her on the phone , please . I need to clarify this . 
 I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ’ ll bring it back in the morning . 
 I know , Janet . I just walked out and forgot it completely . I ’ ll go home and get it at noon , all right ? 
 What ’ s that ? 
 Oh , sorry . I ’ ll put it out . 
 That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . 
 I ’ ll get to work on it right away . Anything else ? 
 Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat . 
 Don ’ mention it . I ’ m glad to help . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I can understand that . Let me see if I can clarify some things for you . 
 Sure . The twenty-ninth is out . I ’ ll be out of the office all day at a seminar . Either the twenty-eighth or the thirtieth is fine . 
 Sounds good to me . You make up the invitations , I ’ Ve got run . I ’ Ve got a meeting in five minutes . 
 Working . Why ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow . 
 I know . I ’ m just waiting for confirmation on one of them . I can get them to you by tomorrow morning . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . Is there a problem , sir ? 
 Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen . 
 Oh , tell him I ’ ll leave them at his office tomorrow afternoon . 
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t do that . They ’ re at the printer ’ s being copied . They ’ ll be back tomorrow before 1 o ’ clock . 
 Sure , Richard . What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Well , why don ’ t we sit down and work out the numbers ? We can always scale down the bonuses if we have to . 
 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? 
 All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Clint . Maybe I didn ’ t make myself clear enough . We should get together to discuss this . 
 Fine . Let ’ s meet this afternoon . I ’ ll draw you a better picture of the situation . 
 Yes , what is it , William ? 
 All right , fine . Thank you , William . 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought everything was set . 
 Maybe we could work out an overtime schedule . It ’ s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth . 
 Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them . 
 There you are . 
 I know . They ’ Ve already sent back two approvals I sent them . Where do I sign ? 
 Oh , right . I remember . There you are . Hope you don ’ t have as many problems as I had ! 
 Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ? I haven ’ t got all the numbers down yet . 
 Thank you very much . Mr . Roberts . 
 Just fine , Mr . Emory . Could you please sign this memo ? I want to get it out to everybody this afternoon . 
 Yes . That ’ s for today . Thank you . 
 Hi , Susan . What can I do for you ? 
 Let me take a look . Just a second . That ’ s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday . 
 Yes , Ms . Ross ? What do you need ? 
 Good news ! I ’ ll be glad to . When do you need it ? 
 Sure , Emily . How can I help you ? 
 That ’ s fine , as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave . 
 How so ? I thought it went fine . 
 I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . 
 Yes ? Who ’ s calling ? 
 No , that ’ s no problem . I ’ m sorry to hear you ’ re not feeling well . Get some rest . If you need to see a doctor , let me know .

 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? 
 All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? 
 Yeah , who ’ s calling ? 
 Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far ! 
 Yes . Ms . Gray . Is there something wrong ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now . 
 Hmm . I see what you mean . Have you spoken with Roger ? He usually does better work than this . 
 All right . Leave these ads with me . I ’ ll speak to him this morning . 
 That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . 
 All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it . 
 Oh ? What ’ s wrong ? 

I ’ d like to talk to you for a second , please .

 Unfortunately , I'm leaving here unexpectedly , and I may be away for several days . 
 Thank you . 
 Is Petti there ? 
 Wrong number ? Are you sure ? I called yesterday and she was there . 
 That's impossible . I remember the number clearly . Isn't this 763-4565 ? 
 Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again . 
 Yeah . I guess it does . Sorry again for bothering you . 

This is frank speaking , may i ask who is calling ? 
 I'm sorry , he is not here at the moment . He has gone to the International Business Center . 
 I'm not sure , he didn't say when he wound return . If you'd like.you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free . 
 Does he have your number ? 
 That was 5264453 6 , right ? 
 You are welcome . 
 How long did you have in mind ? 
 Seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem . 
 Just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off . 
 That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . 
 Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . 
 That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . 

Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ? 
 Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car . 
 Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? 
 What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? 

I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up . 
 That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday . 
 That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you . 

From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . 
 So you ’ Ve acquainted yourself with the company . It ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . 
 Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here . 

I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ? 
 I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them . 
 I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? 

I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . 
 You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? 
 interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? 
 Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? 
 So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . 
 Thank you for inviting me . 
 Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . 
 I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . 
 But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before ! 
 So the company will pay for everything ? 
 That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? 

Comfort Inn , may I help you ? 
 You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?

 Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker .

Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ? 
 Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? 
 Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? 
 What ’ s this sir ? 
 What are these red things sir ? 
 I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then

Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? 
 From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . 
 Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , 
 Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . 

I ’ m ready to settle the bill . 
 Definitely ! Very relaxing . 
 What ? I only stayed three nights . 
 But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . 
 But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . 
 Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? 

Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? 
 The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . 
 That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . 
 Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? 

I want some envelopes please . 
 The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? 
 Yes , please . And I want some glue . 
 And I want a large box of chalk , too . 
 No , thank you . 
 That's all , thank you . 
 I want my change . 
 Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? 
 OK . See you at your office at 2:30 . 

Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ? 
 I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form 
 Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . 
 Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . 
 This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . 
 Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? 
 Ok . Thank you . 
 Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? 
 Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? 
 Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? 
 Great . Talk to you then . 
 May I see your ticket please ? 
 Any form of picture I . D . will do . 
 That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? 
 Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? 
 Ok . Mr . Lee , you ’ re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30 
 Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . 
 Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . 
 Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . 

I would like to buy a ticket to New York please . 
 I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . 
 Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . 
 I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . 
 My return date will be the 14th . 
 Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! 
 Will there be any layovers ? 
 Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? 

Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? 
 Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . 
 Good morning . Thank you . 
 Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . 

Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? 
 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? 
 You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! 
 This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? 

We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . 
 Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . 
 Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! 

Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? 
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? 
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 
 you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? 
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . 
 That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . 

Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ? 
 Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? 
 Great . 
 Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . 
 That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? 
 Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? 

have you finished going through the contract ? 
 Ok . Ask away . 
 yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . 
 that ’ s correct . 
 well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . 
 do you have any other questions ? 
 we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . 
 men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . 
 well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? 
 yes , please . 
 sure , what would you like to discuss ? 
 well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? 
 can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? 
 are you planning on studying abroad ? 
 have you been given a better offer ? 
 well , what's the problem then ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . 
 sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . 

how was your day ? 
 it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . 
 my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . 
 let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? 
 you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? 
 what ’ s that ? 
 you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? 
 how late were you ? 
 you got fired for being a few minutes late ? 
 oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ? 
 What ’ s to get ready ? 
 Nope . 
 Nope . 
 sure . What do you need ? 
 really ? Why ? 
 but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! 
 well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? 
 it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . 
 I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? 
 thanks . I appreciate that . 
 yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? 
 that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . 
 how's your assistant manager getting on ? 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? 
 I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . 
 there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . 

hello ? 
 good morning . 
 oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . 
 is there someone else I can talk to ? 
 any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . 
 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
 that will be fine . 

hi , Isaiah . How are you ? 
 fine . How ’ s your job going ? 
 really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? 
 how ’ s it going ? 
 that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? 
 where will those be located ? 
 when will you find out ? 
 well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! 

how's your new job going ? 
 how are you finding your new boss ? 
 would you rather have her or your old boss back ? 
 how about your new co-workers ? 
 do you miss your old co-workers ? 
 do people in different departments get along with each other ? 
 do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? 
 do you like working in teams ? 

how's your job search going ? 
 I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? 
 that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? 
 by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . 
 it's a job at a recruitment agency . 
 well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! 
 sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! 
 don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . 
 but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . 
 let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? 
 well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . 
 if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . 

Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Late night ? 

Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . 

hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? 
 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? 
 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? 
 do you have experience in the IT field ? 
 do you speak Spanish ? 
 that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? 
 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? 
 I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . 

hi , Betty.what ' s up ? 
 everything has been fine for the past several months . 
 well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners 
 as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . 
 for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . 
 can you think of anything else ? 
 I didn't know that before . 
 i got it . i'll bear it in mind . 
 I hope so . 
 I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? 
 absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . 
 a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? 
 sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . 
 got it . I'll start right now . 
 Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . 
 sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . 
 you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil 
 smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview 
 yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . 
 I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . 
 many say more development opportunities can be found there . 
 and there're higher salaries there . 
 I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . 
 oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . 
 sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . 

do you have s second ? 
 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received 
 that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . 
 that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . 

What did you do at the office today ? 
 What kind of things did you need to check ? 
 I see . Did anything else happen ? 
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . 
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? 
 You certainly had a busy day . 

How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . 
 yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . 
 thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? 
 why is that ? 
 yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . 
 I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . 

Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . 
 Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . 
 Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al 
 Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . 
 Excellent.Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? 
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . 
 I hope to hear from you very soon . 

Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? 
 I see . And how about the working hours ? 
 Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . 
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? 
 That sounds ideal . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . 
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . 
 I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . 
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Yes , please . 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . 
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . 
 Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . 
 Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . 
 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . 
 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . 
 Yes , okay . 
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g 
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really 
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . 
 Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . 
 sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . 
 it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . 
 why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . 
 I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . 
 definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . 

we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . 
 that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s 
 I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . 
 that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . 
 good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . 
 I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . 

hello . How was the marketing meeting ? 
 I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . 
 so what happened in the meeting ? 
 I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . 
 may I make a suggestion ? 
 Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide 
 go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . 
 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th 
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . 
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? 
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? 

What ’ s your working day like ? 
 Do you get paid onetime ? 
 Do you have any breaks ? 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . 

What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 
 That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . 
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . 
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
 When will the branch office open ? 
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? 
 I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . 
 Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? 
 That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? 
 How often do you have meetings ? 
 I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . 
 I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . 
 That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? 

Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ? 
 Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? 

can you squeeze me in sometime today ? 
 I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . 

Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? 
 Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . 

I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . 
 Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . 

Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . 
 I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . 

Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ? 
 Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you . 

when are you going to give me those brochures ? 
 I know , but I want to make reservations this week . 

Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ? 
 Yes , I pretty much understand the company . 
 Yes , I've been observing them . 
 I already have something to wear . 
 OK , I am ready to think of other things . 

I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . 
 No , I probably need to do some more research . 
 I think that their attitude is rather casual . 
 I have absolutely nothing so far . 
 Yes , where should we go from here ? 

Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ? 
 553-2213 . Great , thanks . 

Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening . 
 I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . 
 I want to grow in my job and move ahead . 
 I need to stay in the area because of my family . 
 75,000 per year . 

Can you help me plan the office party ? 
 I need help with food . 
 I think it should be casual . 
 I would prefer Chinese food for this party . 
 I think we should hire a live band . 

Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? 
 Tuesday would be good for me . 
 I think the afternoon would be best . 
 Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . 
 I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . 
 Yes , I know how to get there on my own . 

I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting . 
 I would like to meet on Monday . 
 I want to come in the morning . 
 Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . 
 I think that we should have just the sub-committee . 
 No , I need directions , please . 

Will you tell me the situation ? 
 And then ? 
 I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? 
 I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Of course I remember you . 
 Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . 
 No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? 
 No . It's been empty the whole time . 
 I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? 
 Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
 Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . 
 Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . 
 You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . 
 I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . 

Oh , my God ! What's this ? 
 Look ! This window is open . 
 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? 
 No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . 
 I locked it when I left though . 
 I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! 
 The TV's still here . 
 But what if someone's still up there ? 

There's someone coming . 
 Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . 
 I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? 
 Do you know where they're vacationing ? 
 Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? 

Hi ! What are you watching ? 
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? 
 Why do they go there ? 
 When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . 
 I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . 
 Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . 
 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? 

Are you watching another news report about the war ? 
 How did this war start ? 
 Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . 
 What do you think will happen ? 
 It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . 
 We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . 
 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . 
 The problem is that many poor people might suffer . 
 Some what ? 
 Oh , umm , no thanks . 
 No , I am ok , really . 
 Do you really have all of these drugs ? Where do you get them from ? 
 Sounds good ! Let ’ s see , I want . 
 I want you to put your hands behind your head ! You are under arrest ! 
 What crime did I commit ? 
 I am innocent . 
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! 
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . 
 That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! 

Is English acceptable for you ?

 That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft .

Hello , police office ? 
 Yes , I'd like to report a case . Somebody broke into my house . 
 It happened in the morning . I just came home from work and found the lock broken . 
 I don't know . I called the police as soon as I found the lock broken . 
 Please be quick . 
 My name is Benjamin , and I live in Broad-Gate Street 2101 . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! 
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt .

May I help you ? 
 What dose she look like ? 
 What was she wearing ? 
 When did you last see her ? 
 How long has it been ? 

How does the political system work in your country ? 
 Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? 
 What ’ s a cabinet ? 
 Can any mp make a law ? 
 I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . 
 How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? 

What ’ s the matter , dear ? 
 Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? 
 You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . 
 No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? 
 Well . You must report that it ’ s been stolen . And give the police description of your bag . You ’ d better go to the local police station tomorrow morning . 
 And Lisa . 
 Don't be too upset . It ’ s not the end of the world . 
 Somebody broke into my house in the morning . 
 About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . 
 I wonder how the burglar did it . 
 That's because we have a strong lock . 
 Did you find anything ? 
 Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . 
 Definitely not , sir . 
 The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . 
 Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . 
 They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? 
 OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? 
 Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? 
 Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? 
 It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . 
 Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later . 
 Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ? 
 Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? 
 Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? 
 OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? 
 After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . 
 Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . 
 OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ? 
 Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? 
 You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ? 
 So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? 
 Just make sure you show your total , sign it , and turn it in . 
 You are a quick learner . I don't think you'll have any trouble with this . 
 I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you . 
 Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ? 
 Great ! When I check with the others , I will send you an exact time . When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . 
 Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? 
 That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? 
 OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day ! 
 Of course , pick up the receiver , hit a button and listen for a tone . Are you hearing it ? 
 Well , after you dial 9 on the keypad , you should hear the tone change . 
 When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? 
 For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension . Do you have a list of extensions ? 
 You can always look an extension up on the company website . 
 Yes , I can help you with that . Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons . Do you hear a tone ? 
 Next you dial 9 on the keypad . You should hear the tone change . Did you hear it change ? 
 OK . Well , after you get the line to change you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? 
 To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number . For inside calls , punch in the extension number . Has someone given you an extension list ? 
 All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help . 
 Sure . First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons . Do you hear a tone ? 
 OK . Now you dial 9 on the keypad . Do you hear the tone change ? 
 Well , when you hear it change , that means you have an outside line . Where are you trying to call ? 
 OK . Well , to dial to the outside you just now dial the number . For a call inside the company just hit the extension number . Do you know the extensions ? 
 Well , if you ever need help with an extension , you can dial O . 
 What was the problem ? 
 Things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit . 
 All right , please take this message and call this client . 
 Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board ? 
 I will explain it again ; especially for those of you who arrived late . 
 Yes . What kept you from arriving on time ? 
 I realize that everyone has emergencies ; just get here on time from now on . 
 I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting . 
 Wonderful , does anyone have any questions about this project ? 
 I'm glad that some of you get it , but let's go over it once more . 
 Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ? 
 Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ? 
 Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ? 
 That would be great . What kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ? 
 That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday . 
 Yeah , that's right , around five nine five ten . 
 I'm not sure.Medium , I suppose.Maybe a little on the heavy side . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No .

 Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . 
 Boots 
 No , hiking boots . Brown ones . 

Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! 
 You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs . 
 You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody . 
 We've found some heroin at your house . 
 That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . 
 Whatever you say . 
 Yes . 
 My name is James . 
 American . 
 I don't know him . 
 Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . 
 I stabbed his belly three times . 
 I knew , but I couldn't myself . 
 No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney . 

Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ? 
 I would like to help you with both . 
 A dressy party would be fun ! 
 We should probably have both . 
 Maybe we could do both ! 

Can you tell me what happened here ? 
 Did you see the car before it hit you ? 
 Which lane were you in ? 
 What was your speed then ? 
 Which direction were you coming from ? And which direction were you going ? 
 OK , please move your vehicle off to the side of the road . We will check on it . Do you feel like you need an ambulance , Miss ? 
 No problem , Miss . 
 It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . 

How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 
 Where have you been ? 
 That's too bad . Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again . 
 Thank you , have a seat . We are working on the new project 
 Let's take a look at the Campbell Project . 
 Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand . 
 Do you know which channel it is on ? 
 I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? 
 It's not that serious . 
 You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you . 
 I had no idea when I volunteered to assist governor Brown with this campaign what I was getting myself into . 
 How Ay years have you been working with him ? 
 It's easier doing this kind hard work when I know that I trust the man behind the posters . 
 He would be good . 
 I have some extra help with my project . What would you prefer to help me with , typing or xeroxing ? 
 That is very kind of you to offer to do that . Can you start with the pages on the table ? 
 I like your positive attitude . How many years have you been employed here ? 
 We have a really interesting project coming up . Would you want to join us on it ? 
 OK . I will mention how great you were about helping me today . I appreciate your help . 
 I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . 
 The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . 
 Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . 
 Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . 
 I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ? 
 Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with . 
 I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ? 
 I have a special assignment coming up . Would you be interested in helping me on it ? 
 I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future . Thanks for the help ! 
 Yes , thank you . I am really far behind on this project . Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ? 
 Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ?

 I really don ’ t know that much about putting together a resume . 
 What ’ s the most important part ? 
 What comes next ? 
 Can I list my interests next ? 

I was wondering if this is where the Resume Writing Workshop is being held . 
 It ’ s been a long time since I ’ Ve had to look for work and put a resume together . 
 Where do we begin ? 
 Then what do we do ? 
 What about listing my interests and affiliations next ? 

Can you tell me where the supply shop is ? 
 Great ! Thanks a lot ! 

Excuse me , ma ’ am ?

Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? 
 Could you tell me where the copier is , please ?

 Could I list my interests and special skills next ?

 Did you get laid off ? 
 You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off . 
 No , some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment . 
 Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect . 
 It depends on how much you earned . When you file , they will determine the amount . 
 You need to get a special application form . 
 You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up . 
 They will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them . 
 Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof . 
 You will receive a notice for a phone interview , which will continue the process . 
 Are you working fewer hours than you used to work ? 
 You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours . 
 Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t . 
 You can call your unemployment office , and they can check for you . 
 There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned . They will let you know when you file your claim . 
 Are you still working ? 
 If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours , you may qualify . 
 Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance , so their employees cannot collect benefits . 
 You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck . Check your pay stubs . 
 The more money you made , the more you will earn on unemployment . They have a formula . 
 You need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits . 
 You can call the Employment Development Office and request a form . 
 Be prepared to provide your employer ’ s name and address and what dates you worked . 
 You need to be prepared to show that your unemployment is not your fault . If you have a termination notice , that would be great . 
 The Employment Development Office will call you for an interview . 
 There is a special form to apply for unemployment benefits . 
 You can go online to begin the application process . 
 You need to be able to say whom you worked for and when . 
 You should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance . 
 You need to be interviewed over the phone . They will set up a time for you . 
 The best opportunity is called callous , which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of . 
 There are computers at our EDD offices for you to use in your job search . 
 We have information available about the job market as well as workshops . 
 We have workshops in Resume Writing and Interviewing , to name a few . 
 College job placement services can help . 
 Things are going fairly well . How about you ? 
 I am looking for a job myself . What were you thinking of doing next ? 
 Have you gotten any interviews yet ? 
 Have you thought about the electrician program over there ? 
 I think we should go over there and see if we can apply for that program . 
 You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter . 
 The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly . 
 You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks . 
 They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made . 
 Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick . 
 I am doing well . What ’ s up with you ? 
 The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ? 
 How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ? 
 How about the electrician program that they have listed over there ? 
 Let ’ s go see how we can apply for those positions . 
 There are a few considerations . Is this a part-time or full-time job ? 
 Basically , you really don ’ t need to do much of anything . On the Continued Claim Form , you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning . 
 You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work . You can always come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance . 
 I am great . How are you ? 
 Yeah , me too ! What are you thinking you would like to do ? 
 Have you gone out on any interviews so far ? 
 Did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program ? 
 Let ’ s go check it out again ! 
 A Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter will be sent to you . 
 The Award Letter will inform you as to how much you will receive . 
 Every two weeks you will receive a Continued Claim Form that you must turn in . 
 You must show that you were available and that you looked for work . 
 One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work . 
 The Employment Development Office will send you a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter . 
 In addition to telling you how much you will receive , the beginning and ending dates of your claim will be included . 
 You will receive a Continued Claim Form and every two weeks , you must turn it in . 
 You must show where and when you tried to look for work . If you earned any money , you need to tell them about it . 
 You have to tell them if you were too sick to work on any of the days that you should have been looking for work . 
 Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ? 
 You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid . 
 You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it . 
 Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date . 
 Your check will arrive a little late . 
 Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? 
 Did you work at all during the last pay period ? 
 Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? 
 Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . 
 That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . 
 I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form . 
 You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you . 
 If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in . 
 You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working . 
 Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you . 
 I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . 
 What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? 
 When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? 
 What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . 
 I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . 
 Yes , I would be happy to answer a question about payment . What do you need help with ? 
 Did you generate any income during that time period ? 
 Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form ? 
 When you are able to find work and get paid , we always take away part of your check . 
 Don ’ t do it ! If you get caught making false statements , you can have your claim closed . 
 I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time . 
 Fine , Mr . Tan . I ’ ll see you then . 
 Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ? 
 We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks . 
 It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . 
 You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! 
 Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . 
 I should be coming in on the 11:30 mooring flight . How far is the office from the airport ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ ll be in the baggage area . 
 Certainly , Miss Parker , Let me get my book . My secretary ’ s out and I can ’ t keep anything straight ! 
 No – That ’ s all right . How about the 30th at 4:00 p . m . ? – Is an hour enough ? 
 Of course , Debbie . Let me look at my schedule , - - I have some free time on the 12th . That ’ s this Thursday at 9:00 a . m . 
 Certainly . I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office . 
 You bet . I ’ ll swing by after lunch , okay ? 
 Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans . 
 I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ? 
 Yes , ma ’ am . I could come in any day next week , except for Friday morning . 
 Yes . That would be fine . 
 Hmm . I ’ m pretty booked up this week . Let ’ s move it up to next week . 
 Let me take a look . All right , that ’ s no problem . See you then . 
 Well , I know you ’ re pretty booked up these days . But , we ’ Ve got to work fast on this . 
 Let me see . That ’ s no problem . I ’ ll see you then . 
 Yeah . That ’ s right . What can I do for you ? 
 Let me see . Yeah , all right . I ’ ll be over about two . 
 Sure . Let me just grab my calendar . All right . I ’ m free all day Tuesday and Thursday morning . 
 Okay . Sounds good . See you then . 
 I ’ ll be glad to . But my schedule is super tight this week . I think the only time I have free is at lunch on Wednesday . 
 All right , then . I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday . 
 Sure , I ’ d be glad to . What time frame did he have in mind ? 
 Mm , yeah , that ’ ll be great . Tell him I ’ ll see him then . 
 It ’ s nice to meet you ! Guess we ’ ll be working together . 
 Good . Well , welcome aboard , Ms , Robbins . 
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 
 Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done . 
 Not really , Betty . What do you need ? 
 Sure . I just need to do one other job first . How about if I come up around 11:30 ? 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too , Ms . Green . This company seems so big right now ; I don ’ t know how I ’ ll ever get used to it . 
 Great – That ’ ll be big help , Ms . Green . 
 Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ? 
 Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book . 
 Hi , Sandy . It ’ s Walter Knight . I need to book some time with Mr . Crane . 
 Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday ? 
 Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8 
 That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
 What can I do for you , Kim ? 
 Sure , anytime . 
 Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ? 
 That ’ s all right for my department . I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel . 
 Does everybody need to be there ? Hilary and Jason are on vacation this week . 
 Let me take a look at the schedule . I ’ ll get back to you this afternoon , all right ? 
 No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me . 
 All right , I ’ ll put you in my book . 
 Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? 
 Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . I ’ ll talk to you next week . 
 What time ? I ’ d like to go , but my calendar is really full today . 
 I ’ ll try to make it . I should be able to fit some time in around 3 o ’ clock . 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week . 
 Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday . 
 Hi , Christine . How ’ s it going ? 
 Sure , just a second . All right , what time ? 
 Pretty well , thanks . We ’ Ve just been incredibly busy ! I need to set up a meeting for Mr . Graham . 
 He wants to go over the bonuses for this year . He ’ ll need to meet with Mr . Winthrop and Ms . Montgomery . Can you set it up for me ? 
 Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? 
 Fine . At 3:30 ? 
 Yeah ? What does he want ? 
 I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . 
 I understand , Ms . Fairbanks . 
 Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . 
 Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . 
 I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . 
 He's here . 
 The officer says that I ran a red light , but I didn't . 
 He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . 
 I don't believe it took my picture . 
 I appreciate that . 
 I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . 
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . 
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . 
 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . 
 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . 
 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . 
 that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . 
 You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . 
 Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time . 
 No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . 
 I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment . 
 I would like to report a break-in . 
 I believe it happened last night . 
 It happened at my house . 
 I haven't checked yet . 
 My front window was broken . 
 I'd appreciate that . 
 I watched it happen . 
 Yes . I was right there . 
 This guy tried to rob the bank . 
 I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . 
 He tried to leave with the money . 
 They caught him before he could walk through the front door . 
 I would like you to be my lawyer . 
 I ’ m going on trial . 
 It ’ s a felony charge . 
 How much do you charge ? 
 That ’ s highway robbery . 
 Okay . You ’ re hired . 
 About what ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 I am very impressed . 
 That is very nice of you . 
 Yes , I am going to vote . 
 Thank you and good luck . 
 What do you want to speak to me about ? 
 Oh , you do ? 
 What made you decide to volunteer ? 
 Good for you . 
 I will be voting . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Of course . How about you ? 
 How ’ s that ? 
 Why ? 
 Why not ? 
 Why don ’ t you go to work late ? 
 I see . 
 Where do I go to pick up my ballot ? 
 How ’ s that ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . 
 Here you go . 
 What am I supposed to do now ? 
 Okay . Wish me luck . 
 Do you offer a safety deposit box rental service here ? 
 I'd like to put some valuables inside , you know , documents and jewellery , things like that . 
 What rental do you offer ? 
 I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help . 
 I'd like to rent a safety deposit box here , please . 
 No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer . 
 Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind . 

Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ? 
 We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box . 
 You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . 
 If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . 

First National Bank . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What's your name and account number ? 
 I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please . 
 You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . 
 Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . 
 That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks . 
 Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ? 
 The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ? 
 OK ... and what deposit do I need ? I mean , is there a minimum deposit ? 
 That's no problem . How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ? 
 Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye . 
 Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? 
 I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . 
 Do you need anything else from me ? 
 No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some . 
 I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are . 
 Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions . 
 What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? 
 Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . 
 What if I repay it early . Any perks ? 
 So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . 

Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ? 
 Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? 
 Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? 
 Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? 

Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? 
 Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? 
 You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . 

Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ? 
 Of course . As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . 
 There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . 
 There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... 
 Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . 

Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ? 
 How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? 
 Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... 
 Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . 
 Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . 
 I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? 
 Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? 
 How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? 
 Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ... 
 OK , what does that entail ? 
 Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? 
 I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? 
 Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today . 
 Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . 
 I need to have a credit check done for my company . 
 That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? 
 Great . I'll wait right here , thanks . 
 I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . 
 Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . 
 I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? 
 So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? 
 That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time . 
 My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . 
 Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? 
 Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? 
 What do you require ? 
 That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . 
 I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . 
 Have you invested in the stock market before ? 
 But that is a little risky , you know . 
 Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . 

This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? 
 We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? 
 The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... 
 That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 
 What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 

Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? 
 Are you an existing customer ? 
 May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . 
 That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . 

Credit Services , how can I help you ? 
 Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? 
 Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . 
 It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . 
 Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . 

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? 
 Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . 
 You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . 
 Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . 
 Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . 
 For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . 

Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? 
 Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . 
 There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . 
 If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . 

It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? 
 I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? 
 I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? 
 I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? 
 We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . 

Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? 
 How so ? 
 We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . 
 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . 
 I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . 

Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? 
 This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . 
 That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . 
 May I have your details , and I'll check for you . 
 OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . 

Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? 
 We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... 
 And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . 
 What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? 
 As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . 

Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? 
 I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? 
 That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . 
 Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . 
 Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . 

IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ? 
 Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? 
 Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . 
 Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week . 
 It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ? 

Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? 
 Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . 
 What perfect timing ! 
 Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . 
 That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . 

How can I help you this afternoon ? 
 Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . 
 You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? 
 Thank you . And you require ... 
 Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please . 
 Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me . 

Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ? 
 Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . 
 Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . 
 Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . 
 As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . 

Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? 
 You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? 
 Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . 

Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? 
 No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? 
 Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . We will be putting in a new ATM in the near future , though . That should help to ease the queues . 
 I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? 
 That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? 
 It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? 

Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? 
 Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? 
 That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . 
 How much would you like to withdraw ? 
 That's fine . 
 Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . 

Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . 
 A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . 
 We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . 

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can I help you with , Sir ? 
 Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . 
 No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? 

I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch . You wanted a chat about housing loans ? 
 I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? 
 So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . 
 That is good , it should speed things up nicely . 
 Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . 
 That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks . 
 Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . 
 Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? 

May I help you at all ? 
 We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . 
 This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . 
 That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . 

Good day ! What can we do for you ? 
 Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . 
 With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . 
 That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . 

Personal Loans , how may I help ? 
 Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply 
 Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . 
 There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . 

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 
 OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? 
 You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . 
 Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . 

Did you need help with something ? 
 I can help you with that . 
 I work here . 
 May I see your ID ? 
 All right , here is your ballot card . 
 Go to a voting booth and vote . 

Are you planning on voting ? 
 Yes , but this will be my first time voting . 
 Yes , and I have no idea how to do it . 
 I don ’ t know any of the laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
 I didn ’ t know that . 
 That ’ s good to know . 

Are you going to vote ? 
 Yes , and for the first time . 
 I don ’ t know how to vote . 
 I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on . 
 They do ? 
 Thanks for telling me . 

Will you be voting this year ? 
 This is going to be my first time voting . 
 I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . 
 I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
 Nobody told me that before . 
 I ’ m so glad you told me that . 

I am really excited ! 
 I just got done voting . 
 I just turned 18 last month . 
 Why ? 
 I didn ’ t think of it that way . 
 Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . 

Did you vote yesterday ? 
 What candidate did you vote for ? 
 I ’ m shocked he actually won . 
 How ’ d you know ? 
 What about him being black ? 
 I think you have a point . 
 Excited about what ? 
 Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ? 
 That ’ s lucky . 
 You turned 18 in an election year . 
 Really ? 
 You ’ re a part of history . 
 What are you excited about ? 
 Was this your first time ? 
 You ’ re lucky . 
 Because you turned 18 in an election year . 
 You didn ’ t ? 
 You should be , because you ’ re a part of history . 
 Of course ! 
 My vote was for Barack Obama . 
 I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . 
 Nobody could compete with him . 
 Times are changing . 
 I support our new President 100 % . 
 My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . 
 Thank you . 
 I need to know how much money is in my account . 
 Certainly . 
 You know I did . 
 I voted for Obama , of course ! 
 I knew he would win . 
 He was the top candidate . 
 That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . 
 I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . 
 Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine . 
 Yes , I sure can . I feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . This machine is working , then ? 
 Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ... 
 There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . 

I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM . 
 Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back ! 
 Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see . 
 Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it . 
 Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? 
 I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks . 
 Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . 
 Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? 
 Then it'll give me my money ? 
 Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? 
 Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful . 
 Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ? 

Hello , Mr Kowalski ? 
 Which city are you staying in right now ? And the name of your hotel ? 
 Do you have your passport with you ? Or do you by any chance know the number ? 
 Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily . 
 You can go to any branch of IBA and request the Emergency Assistance Service . Everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry . 

IBA , Client Services Department . Shelley speaking , how can I help ? 
 Certainly , that's what we're here for . What can I help you with ? 
 Calm down , Sir . Is that an IBA Debit or Credit Card ? 
 Just calm down , Sir . OK , when do you think you lost it ? 
 That's fine , Sir . Let me just take some details FRCM you and we can help you . 

Hello , Sir . Are you still there ? 
 Did you check with reception at your hotel ? 
 OK , that's fine , Sir . We just need to ask you some questions for security purposes . 
 Could I have your name , please ? And do you know your card number ? 
 That should be fine , Mr Kowalski . And your PIN number ? 
 That's completely natural . Most of our customers do the same thing . Could you just hold for a moment please ? Thank you . 
 I'm here to ask about a loan . 
 I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . 
 Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? 
 Yes , I do . I was born and bred here . 
 I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years . 
 Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . 
 Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . 
 Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . 
 I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice . 
 That's right . Here you go . 
 OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . 
 That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . 
 How soon before this goes through ? 
 Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything . 
 It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . 
 I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . 
 I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? 
 Right ... anything else ? 
 And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . 
 Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . 
 I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . 
 It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ? 
 Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . 
 Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign . 
 Hello . Could you give me some details about your Personal Pledge Loans , please ? 
 So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? 
 Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? 
 And the maximum loan amount ? 
 OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . 

Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? 
 Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . 
 One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . 
 That is correct .

 What are you saying ? 
 Who is ? 
 We can work something out . 

Order in the court ! 
 What is it ? 
 You do realize that all the evidence points to you ? 
 How do you figure that ?

Have you seen the news today ? 
 Did you know there was a blackout last night ? 
 Well , some people decided to loot last night . 
 They took advantage of the blackout . 
 Yes , apparently four stores were broken into . 
 There was no evidence of who did it . 

Did you see the news today ?

 A bunch of people went looting last night . 
 They took full advantage of the lights being out .

 The police don't know who did it . 

Have you watched today's news ? 
 Did you hear about last night's blackout ? 
 Some people went looting because of the blackout .

 What do you plead ? 
 All the evidence indicates that you are guilty . 
 Is that right ? 
 Who is the guilty party ? 
 I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you . 

They don't really think you took it , do they ? 
 How many of them were there ? 
 Like what ? 
 What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ? 
 Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . 

Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . 
 When did this happen ? 
 Why didn't you report it before ? 
 Please tell me exactly what happened .

 Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ? 
 I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
 I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
 Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . 

Have you every belonged to a political party ? 
 Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ?

 Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . 

hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?

 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . 
 don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . 
 We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . 
 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist 
 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . 
 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . 
 Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . 
 They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle

 Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us . 
 I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . 
 What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? 
 I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... 
 Yes . I received everything in the post this morning . 
 What's the exchange rate today ? 
 Great ! Do you need me to sign anything ? 

Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account . 
 Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you .

 Thanks . 
 That's a very popular way to pay nowadays , totally hassle free ! 
 Please fill in this application and sign your name down here , at the bottom . 
 I just need to see some ID , like a passport for example . 
 We usually ask for 100 RIB , Sir . 
 So , that's everything done for you . Here's your new cheque book , the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days . 
 It is . What can I do for you ? 
 Would that be a Fixed Deposit or a Current Deposit ? 
 We have various different types of Current Deposit , the Variable Term Deposit , a Notice Deposit and the Usual Current Deposit . Which would you like ? 
 OK , just a moment . I'll find the relevant data and help you with that . 
 I'd like to make a deposit please , into my granddaughter's account . It's her birthday on Friday . 
 Yes , right here . 
 Here ? And here ? 
 1,000 RIB . 
 It's an important birthday . 
 Certainly , Sir . You do have a Current Account with us right ? 
 Yes , Sir . In order to get a credit card with us , you'll need to open a Current Account here . Could you please fill out this form with your relevant details ? 
 Yes , a passport will be fine . 
 That's fine , Sir . We'll see you again a little later . 
 Yes . I want to deposit some money into my Savings Account , please . 
 Correct . 
 There we go . Thanks very much . 
 I'd like to withdraw some money from my account . 
 Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ? 
 Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much . 
 Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it . 
 I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem . 
 Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes . 
 Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky . 
 Hello , Ms Li , this is Mr Peng . 
 We'll be coming in tomorrow to make a rather large cash withdrawal , it's for payroll . 
 500,000 RIB . Do you need me to give you my account number ? 
 Thanks very much for your help , Li Lan . See you tomorrow . 
 I have a Time Deposit here and I'd like to get the money now . 
 Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time . 
 Well , it can't be helped . I really must have that money . Thank you . 
 I'd like to withdraw 35,000 RIB from my Corporate Account . 
 Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E . 
 Here you go . 
 Oh , how silly of me . Can we correct it here ? 

Hello , IBA Bank , how can I help you ? 
 You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM . 
 Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal . 

This is IBA Bank , Claire speaking , how may I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , could you be a little more specific ? 
 OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Not quite , Sir . We will need to also know the account number , the deposited amount and your PIN number . You will also have to come in and fill out some forms . 
 I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything . 
 So , I can get my new card today ? 
 7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ? 

Mr Moon , how good to see you again . 
 Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . 
 If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . 

After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . 
 It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . 
 First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . 

Hi , how can I help ? 
 Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . 
 Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . 

Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? 
 You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? 
 Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? 
 This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? 

Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ? 
 OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ? 
 OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . 

Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? 
 I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from 
 Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? 

OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . 
 For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB . 
 You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account . 
 With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . 
 Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? 
 10,000 Japanese yen . 
 Fixed . 
 For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know . 
 You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . 
 I see . What's the interest like on those ? 
 Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is ! 
 Hello , Miao Ping . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account today . 
 I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year . 
 Good , thanks . I look forward to hearing from you . 
 I want to save some US dollars into my account . 
 Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for . 
 Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? 
 That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . 
 Hi . We'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account , please . 
 Yes , yes , we do . Right here . 
 We will go for the US dollar account . 

Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you today ? 
 I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ? 
 The first step is to fill in the Account Opening Application and the accompanying Seal Card , stamped with your company's seal . I mean , the business seal and the corporate seal . We also need your Business Licence and the Enterprise Standard Code Certificate . Then we can go on to the next step . 

Good afternoon . How can I help ? 
 Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ? 
 Today's rate is 821.32 USD to 100 RIB , which isn't bad . 

May I help you ? 
 Here we can exchange HAD , USD and Euros . Which do you require ? 
 At the moment it's 830.43 RIB for 100 USD , which is a pretty good rate . 

Hello . Is everything OK ? Can I help you ? 
 That's no problem . Is it cash ? 
 Of course . If you could sign your name on the bottom line here , and write your address here . And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport . 

Hello and welcome . How may I be of service ? 
 Yes , of course . What's the amount you'd like to change ? 
 Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport . Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom . 
 Here is your RIB , the exchange form and receipt and your passport . Please check the amount . 
 Yes , that can be done here . Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency . 

Hello , how can I help ? 
 That does depend on where you plan to travel . If you are planning to travel to Hong Kong or Macao we can exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . If your destination is elsewhere , we can exchange up to 2,000 USD . 
 OK , I'll process that for you now . 
 Sorry to say it , but neither of those . I'm here to close our account with you . The market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it's just not sensible for us to stay . 
 I guess I should just withdraw everything . 
 Here you go . That's everything , then . Thanks very much for your service over the years . 
 Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ? 
 Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia . 
 That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks . 
 Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! 
 That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . 

Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 It's very quick and easy . It just takes 24 hours , we guarantee that . All you need to do is fill in this slip and we can proceed . 
 There is a service commission that you must pay . It's 1 % of the funds to be remitted , so you should pay an extra 6 RIB . 
 I've got a Remittance Advice and I'd like to cash it . 
 Here you are . I'm here on business and this is from my boss , it's for my expenses so I need cash . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Here's my passport . Is that OK ? 
 I want to send some money to Hangzhou . Today , if possible . 
 I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ? 
 Right , that's fine . I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible . 
 Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account . 
 What ? What's wrong ? 
 It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before . 
 Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank . 
 Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance . 
 Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see . 

Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ? 
 Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars . 
 Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations . 
 Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ? 
 Yes , please . 70,000 US dollars is being transferred into our account . 
 I'm the accountant with Go Thong Computers . 
 No problem . Can I withdraw all of it now ? 

Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Of course , that's no problem at all . 
 How much would you like to change ? 
 Please fill in this exchange form , and I'll need to see your passport , and sign here . That's the money and your passport back . Of course , if you don't spend all of it , you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you . 
 I've just had some money sent from Germany , in Euros . 
 I have my passport right here , and here are the account details . The name , number ... 
 That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . 

Sir , are you alright ? Just try to calm down , Sir . What's happened ? 
 OK , just take a deep breath , Sir . Everything is going to be fine . Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques , whatever the reason . Please fill it in and we can get moving on this . 
 Yes , Sir . Do you have that information with you ? At this bank , we always recommend our customers write down the reference number of each Traveller's Cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the Traveller's Cheques . 
 Yes , I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques . 
 I think Euros will be the best , as I'll only be in Mainland Europe . 
 5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks . 
 That would be perfect , thank you . 
 Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques . 
 Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . 
 Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ? 
 That would be wonderful . 
 But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ? 
 OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . 
 Hello . I'm here to get my salary . 
 No problem . 
 I think just 3,000 RIB will be enough . 
 Why ? They keep going up . 

Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! 
 That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . 
 So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? 
 Oh , domestic things ? Yes , of course , we can help you with that . 
 Oh , thank you . Yes , please . What I need is to handle some domestic affairs . 
 Well , I need a Deposit Certification to handle this . 
 Yes , yes . Here it is . By the way , is there a handling fee ? 

Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . 
 I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . 
 Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . 
 That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . 
 I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land . 
 Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha ! 
 OK ... so it'll come out of my account ? Well , that makes it much easier . 
 Nope . That's everything , thanks . 
 I need to have some money transferred from the UK , from my company . It's kind of an emergency . 
 That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? 
 T / T ? What on earth is that ! ? Sorry , but I've never heard of it . T / T ? 

Welcome . How can we be of service today ? 
 Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ? 
 Please . Just to double check all the details . 

IBA Bank , Business Banking Department . Ling Ming speaking . How may I help you ? 
 Hello , Mr Gwent . What can I do for you today ? 
 Of course . Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency ? 
 Yes , here it is . That's received and cleared , so it's available for withdrawal . 
 Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . 
 We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . 
 Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . 

Hello , Sir . What can I do for you today ? 
 We've just started a new business at this bank , Bank-Insurance Link . 
 Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company . 
 There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . 

Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? 
 That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . 
 Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . 
 I started a new job last month and I'm expecting my first salary . 
 So I was told , yes . They gave me this book ? 

Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ? 
 It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement . 
 We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with . 
 Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee . 

You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ? 
 I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . Take your time , Sir . 
 Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on . 
 And what does that entail ? 
 How can I do that ? 

Hello . Are you here to withdraw some money from your account at the Securities Company ? I'll need to see your Passbook for that account . 
 Thanks . OK ... your balance is 320,214 RIB . How much do you require today ? 
 Please fill in this transfer form and enter your password , here . Then the transaction should be completed . 

Good day to you . How can we assist you today ? 
 Yes , you can . The best way is to first select the company you want to buy from , then we can help you to do it . Do you have a Current Account here ? 
 Well , it certainly makes everything easier , both at this end and at your end . 

Good afternoon , how can I help ? 
 Of course . Your balance is 92,320 RIB in your Securities Account . How much would you like to withdraw ? 
 No problem . Please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the Securities Company to your account . 
 I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? 
 Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? 
 So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? 
 OK , I think I've got it . 
 I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? 
 Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . 
 I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . 
 That settles it then . 5,000 RIB it is , thanks . 
 I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? 
 Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB . 
 Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? 

What can I do for you ? 
 I see . The Fund Trading System of our Net Banking deals with both trading and information . If you use this system , you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds . You can also get lots of other useful information . 
 Fund info , the fund code , fund net value per unit , fund public info , fund account balance , fund trading conformation , daily details and the history . With our Net Banking , anything is possible ! 
 Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency . 
 There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet . 
 Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that . 

Hello there , Sir . I've dealt with you before , haven't I ? 
 Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 I see . We offer Agent Services free of charge here . Before your new business begins trading , we could , on behalf of your existing company , do a series of registration and get the certificates you need . If you are unsure of the local laws , that is . 
 Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ? 
 So , it's going to cost me then ? 

Hi there . Do you need any help ? 
 First of all , you should open a Fund Account with us , just fill in this form . We'll need to see some ID and your Cash Card . 
 You'll have to pay 20 RIB , and then you will have your Southern Fund Management company card . 
 Yes , we'll need to fill in this form , for fund trading and this one , for subscribing for and / or applying for purchasing fund units . The minimum is 500 RIB . 
 Yes . I'm sorry , but I've lost my passbook . 
 About RIB 12,000 . 
 I'm Bob Brown . But I can't recall my account number . 
 Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . 
 OK . 
 Hello , yes , I opened an L / C with you recently . We opened it 7 days ago . 
 We would like to amend it , please . 
 It's all agreed , here's a letter to prove it . 

I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ? 
 2,000 AD $ . 
 What is the difference between them ? 
 Well , I think the cable is better . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Here you are . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , sir . How much would you like to remit ? 
 No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ? 
 If you take M / T , it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money . 
 Would you please fill in this application form ? 
 For 1,200 yuan to Nanchang , the commission is 12 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 

Good afternoon . Which service do you require . 
 What you need to do is apply for an amendment on your existing L / C . 
 You'll need to fill in this application form and there is a charge of 30 US dollars for this . 
 Thanks . Yes ... that's all in order . What we will do now is send the L / C amendment to the negotiating bank . As soon as we know anything , we'll contact you . 
 Hello . I've been told to come in and see someone about my L / C . I just had a message to come in and see someone called Kristy . 
 I received a letter asking me to come in and see you . I'm Mr Simons from Dalton's Electrics . 
 Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ? 

Hello , JC Consulting PLC . Chris Edwards speaking . 
 Hi Kristy ! What's going on ? 
 Yes , I certainly do . 
 Oh , dear ! There isn't a problem , is there ? 
 Kristy , that's wonderful ! Thanks so much for contacting me personally . 
 Well , I've been browsing online , but I ’ m not really sure what to do about payment . I would like to know what the most convenient way to do it is . 
 That does sound interesting . How can I get this service ?

 Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ?

 Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here . 
 Is there any way we can speed it up ? 

Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ? 
 That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . 
 You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due . 

Hello , Sir . Can I help you with anything ? 
 No problem at all . With this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ? 
 Select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here ... then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu ... OK , good . Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference . 
 And your statement reference and the payment amount . Click on next , then ' pay beneficiaries ' . That's it ! All done . 
 My home phone , the landline . I don't have a mobile phone , far too complicated for an old lady like me ! Do you need my Bank Book ? 
 Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company . 

Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ? 
 Yes , we can do that . We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents . They all need to be in duplicate . 
 Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? The Legal Rep , I mean ? We also need the Loan Certificate as well . Do you have that ? 

The ATM machine outside won't give me back my card . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 How did you know ? 
 Oh . But can I have my card back now ? 

Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 No problem . Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents ? 
 There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now . 
 No , you don't need to pay anything on top . We just simply deduct the discounting interest . 
 Do you have any other accounts with this bank ? 
 In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ? 
 Yes . Do you know what type of checking account you would like to open , business or personal ? 
 Then you would like the ' no frills ' business account . 
 Yes , luckily our office is just down the street . 
 Oh , I see . 

Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ? 
 Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . 
 That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . 
 As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . 
 There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . 
 And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . 
 Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . 
 Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? 
 Well , everything really . 

Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? 
 Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . 
 Unfortunately , not . 
 Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . 
 Yes . I hope you can help . I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan . So , I was wondering what you offer here ? Do you have various types ? 
 I see ... 
 To be honest , I'm not exactly sure what we require just now . 
 Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan . 
 Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate . 
 Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you . 
 Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ? 
 That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead . 
 It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently . 
 We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though . 
 That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see . 
 I'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting . 
 How long a period will you look at to determine this ? 
 That sounds simple enough . It's Friday today , I'll be back on Monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . See you then , and enjoy your weekend . 
 I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan . 
 Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible . 
 For my credit worthiness ? 

Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? 
 OK , just a moment ... yes , it has arrived . The amount is 51,998 US dollars net , 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank . 
 It's already credited to your account . 
 Hello , this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling . We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank . 
 They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ? 
 It's 150 RIB for the service . 

Good day . How can we assist you ? 
 It certainly is . Do you have your contract and Import License ? 
 Thanks . What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us . 
 That's great . We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service , though . Could you please fill in this ? Thanks . 
 Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months . 
 Yes , I have known of it . 
 20,000 RIB . 
 It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . 
 Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Thanks a lot . Good-bye . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , it has . I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business . I did have a little time to relax in Dubai , though . 
 I need to effect a payment under my L / C . Not the old one , the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week . 
 It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ? 

Hello . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? 
 What's the difference between the two ? 
 Then how about the current account ? 
 Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you very much . 

Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? 
 Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you . 
 Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount . 

Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . 

Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ? 
 OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates . 
 Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . 

Hello . Is everything OK , there ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular . 
 I would recommend it , yes . Then you just need to complete that form . 
 Yes , that's all in order . Let's get this processed for you , then . 
 Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . 
 I prefer time deposit . 
 RIB deposit . 
 Yes . 
 Six months . 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you . 
 I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong . 
 Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . 
 Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? 
 That's a great idea ; thanks for your help . 
 I want to effect payment under an L / C today . 
 That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? 

Hello , welcome to the International Business Counter , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Of course . Is there a problem with them ? 
 You will need to return the documents . That's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now . 

Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how can we be of service ? 
 Just pulling up your information now . Yes , some documents arrived for you from Sapporo . 
 Actually , there is a problem . It's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes . 
 No problem , I'll just get the form for you . 
 Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents . 
 That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? 
 Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . 
 That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . 
 Yes . I've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . You see ? It should be KN509 . 
 Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . 

Welcome to IBA . How can I help you ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice . 
 JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? 
 Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . 

Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? 
 The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . 
 Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . 
 The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . 
 Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . 

Hello , there . What can we do for you today ? 
 Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . 
 Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . 
 Certainly , Sir . Via phone or Internet , any time , any place . 
 The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! 
 I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . 
 I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . 
 And for the Savings Deposit ? 
 Wow ! A third more ? Very good . 
 Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you . 
 I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . 
 What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all . 
 That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . 
 Hi . I've been sent over from Turner Interiors . They said I need to collect some sort of L / C ? Do you have it ? 
 It should be from Sayuri Beds . Is that right ? 
 That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ? 
 Perfect . Thank you , goodbye ! 
 Hello there . I need some advice about personal finance . Could you help me please ? 
 Well , I've been very busy recently and I'm having trouble keeping up to date with everything , so I just wondered what exact service you offer . 
 That sounds perfect and just what I'm looking for . 
 Hello , Tina . An acquaintance of mine has just told me that your bank has started a new Personal Wealth Management Service . Is that right ? 
 How would I go about applying for this service ? 
 That's so simple . I'll come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . Thank you very much , Tina . 

How can I help you today , Sir ? 
 That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time . 
 Of course . It's 33234 . That will put you in touch with a Personal Banker . 
 That's the beauty of the service ; they can deal with everything , with total security . 

Welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? 
 Yes , that is our Personal Wealth Management Service . 
 Of course . Financing Link is a value-added service , and can be tailored to suit your requirements . 
 Certainly . We can arrange the structure to suit whatever you require . That's why this service is so popular ; it's suitable for everyone because we make it that way . 

Hello , can I help ? 
 I have it right here . 
 No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here . 
 Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ? 

Good afternoon , Felix Wassermann Associates . Lawson speaking , how can I help you ? 
 B :: Miao Eng ! I'd know that voice anywhere . What can I do for you ? Any problems ? 
 That is good news . 
 Perfect . Thanks very much for calling . See you soon , bye ! 
 Hello . I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software . I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C . 
 I have , but I have never done this before so would it be possible for you to double check them ? 
 Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ... 
 That's fine . Thank you again . 
 Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates . 
 It's NX567822100007 . 
 OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ? 

Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ? 
 Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? 
 Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? 
 What do you recommend we do ? 
 I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . 
 I've prepared some L / C documents , all in accordance with the conditions . There shouldn't be any problems ; I've done about a million of these things recently . 
 Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye ! 
 This is James Hong calling from Lincoln Bank . 
 I'm calling to let you know that the funds for NX567822100007 have arrived . 
 Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ? 

Are you the loan officer of this bank ? 
 I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about a loan I want to make . 
 Thank you . See , I ’ m planning to buy a car here and I ’ m planning to use my time deposit here as the collateral . 
 Of course . 
 Sure . At present one dollar is equal to 6.4392 yuan . How many dollars would you like to change ? 
 Please wait for a moment ... Now here is your Chinese currency . See if it's right . It's 3,220 yuan . Please keep this exchange memo . You may need it for converting when you leave China . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation . 
 I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week . 
 I will give a call . 
 Speaking . 
 Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state . 
 Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more . 
 Bye ! 
 Yes . Do you exchange foreign money here ? 
 What kinds of currency do you change ? 
 Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ? 
 I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here . 
 Thank you . 
 No , thanks . My husband said , We'd like to pay now . 
 What ? Where does that five come from ? 
 But I only have 900 in cash here . Can you let it go for 900 yuan ? 
 My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ? 
 Great . Here it is . 
 Yes , please . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account . 
 Certainly . Just make them out to National Bank , and sign and date them . 

Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Please fill out this deposit form , first . 
 No , that's fine . Do you bring your bankbook with you ? 
 Wait a moment , please . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 The deposit rate is 0.8 % every month . 

Good morning . May I help you , sir ? 
 Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ? 

Good morning , may I help you ? 
 Please fill out this form , please . 
 Yes . You must put on its name and full address . 
 Let me check . Yes . Your one thousand remittance , please . 
 This rate is one percent . That will be 10 Yuan . 
 Generally it will arrive within a week . 
 No . That's all . You have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . 

Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? 
 I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . 
 Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? 
 All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . 
 That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? 
 I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . 
 Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? 
 Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . 

Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? 
 That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? 
 That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . 
 What is it , Mrs . Wang ? 
 Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? 
 Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . 
 As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . 
 The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . 
 That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . 
 Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . 

Good Morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 How much do you want to change ? 
 It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB . 
 The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . 
 It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? 
 I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . 
 Okay . Please sign here in this form . 
 Here is the 6,100 RIB . 

When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? 
 If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . 

Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? 
 Wow , you sound very professional . 

I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . 
 I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . 
 Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . 
 Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . 
 As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . 
 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . 
 It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . 

I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . 
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . 
 That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . 

I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . 
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . 
 Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . 

Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? 
 What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? 
 Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . 

I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . 
 Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . 
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . 
 I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . 
 Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any discount . 
 That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . 
 I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . 
 By the coming September . 
 Certainly ! 
 We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . 
 We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 

Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? 
 I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . 
 You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . 

We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . 
 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . 
 The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . 

We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . 
 I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . 
 That's understood . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . 
 That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . 
 But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . 
 I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . 
 Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . 
 To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . 

I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? 
 In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . 
 First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? 
 The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 How do you do , Ms . Chi ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . 
 I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . 
 Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ? 
 What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis . 
 All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ? 
 I'll be expecting you , then . 
 We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? 
 Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . 
 But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . 
 That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . 
 If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . 

If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . 
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . 
 But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . 
 I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . 
 If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . 
 What's your last word as to the date then ? 
 All right . I'll take you at your word . 
 I promise . 
 I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . 
 How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . 
 We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug . 

I've come about your wools . According to our market survey , wools are likely to find a ready market in our country . 
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? 
 Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ? 
 Okay , see you tomorrow ! 
 Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . 
 You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders . 
 It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . 
 Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . 
 By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . 

Hey , daughter . Let me ask you something . 
 Do you have life insurance ? 
 You have children now . What if something , god forbid , happens to you ? 
 A 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He will give you a good deal . 
 Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . 
 Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas . 
 Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ? 
 He lost his kids ’ college money by trading . 

The City Bank . May I help you , sir ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Alright , what's your address ? 
 When would you like your account closed ? 
 Okay . Where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ? 
 Alright , We'll take care of that . 
 Which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ? 
 Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries . 
 Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . 
 Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? 
 Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ? 

Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . 
 If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . 
 Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? 
 Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? 
 Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . 
 I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? 
 Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . 
 What's the interest rate ? 
 How do I go about taking it out ? 
 All right , thank you ! 
 Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... 
 Emily Smith . 
 Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 Do you have an account with this bank ? 
 In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . 
 The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . 
 Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . 
 You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . 
 You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . 
 Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? 
 I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . 
 You mean there is really not that much of a difference . 
 Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . 
 Ok . 
 Do we need to put on the jackets too ? 
 Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? 
 I see . How do you control the quality ? 
 What ’ s the monthly output ? 
 What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? 

How large is the plant ? 
 It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 How many employees do you have in this plant ? 
 Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? 
 That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . 
 Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . 
 Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . 

I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . 
 You've had a good trip , I hope . 
 It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . 
 We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . 
 Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . 
 But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . 
 500 pieces . 
 All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . 
 We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . 
 Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . 
 Good , that's all then . 

I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . 
 Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . 
 Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . 
 In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . 
 Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . 
 The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . 
 We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . 
 Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
 Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . 
 Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? 
 All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . 

This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . 
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . 
 What is your proposal ? 
 Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . 
 The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . 
 You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . 
 Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . 
 My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . 
 I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? 
 Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? 
 Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . 
 We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . 
 We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . 
 We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . 
 As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? 
 Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . 
 On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . 
 Tomorrow afternoon . 

How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? 
 That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? 
 Is that including tax ? 
 How much is your profit margin then ? 

I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . 
 Take your time . 
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . 
 Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . 
 Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . 
 How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? 
 Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
 Very well , I will . 
 As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . 
 So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . 
 To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . 
 I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . 
 Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? 

May I help you ? 
 what currency would you like to trade in ? 
 No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? 
 It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? 

So how did I do ? 
 I lost ? 
 So the price was good ? 
 So I didn't miss by much then . 
 I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . 

How much will our order from your factory be ? 
 I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? 
 Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . 
 Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . 

Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? 
 Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? 
 I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... 

You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . 
 I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . 
 We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . 
 Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . 
 Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? 
 Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . 
 Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . 
 Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? 
 You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? 

Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . 
 No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? 
 Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . 
 I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . 
 Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? 

Sandrawu Chunk International . 
 I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? 
 Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? 
 Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . 

Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . 
 Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . 
 Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? 
 Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production 
 Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... 
 Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? 
 Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? 
 Ah , get back to you . 

We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? 
 But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... 
 How much do you think it would cost ? 
 $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! 
 Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . 

We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . 
 Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? 
 So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . 

I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . 
 Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . 
 Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . 
 We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . 
 Done ... 
 I think my husband has some . 
 That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . 
 Certainly . 
 Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . 
 Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . 
 If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? 

Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? 
 We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable 
 Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? 
 Can I use the FAS terms ? 

Do you think I should turn down his offer ? 
 But we may not get another partner . 

What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? 
 Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 What kind of change , just in prices ? 
 You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? 
 So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . 

Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? 
 I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? 
 To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . 
 Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . 
 To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? 

Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? 
 Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? 
 We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . 
 Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . 
 It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? 
 Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . 

Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? 
 Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . 
 As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . 
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Why use wooden cases ? 
 Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . 
 You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? 
 Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . 
 Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . 
 Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . 
 Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . 
 Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . 

Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? 
 I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . 
 Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? 
 I see . 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 
 Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . 
 Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . 
 That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . 
 By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? 
 If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . 
 All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . 

Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . 
 That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . 
 Sure . 
 Oh , the packing looks very nice . 
 Good , what about the export packing ? 
 Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . 
 I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? 
 Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . 

That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . 
 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . 
 Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . 
 All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . 
 Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . 
 Thanks . 
 I should say it is something we have never come across before . 
 In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . 
 Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? 
 In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? 
 Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . 
 Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . 
 Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
 We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . 
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Why use wooden cases ? 
 The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . 
 No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . 
 Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . 
 But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . 
 I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . 
 We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . 
 Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . 
 I don't think we can . 
 By the middle of October , I think . 
 I understand . 
 But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . 
 I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . 
 You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . 
 All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . 
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . 
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 

It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . 
 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 
 It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . 
 Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . 
 It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? 

Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . 
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . 

Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . 
 I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . 
 I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . 
 In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? 
 Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? 
 It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . 
 If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . 

I want to open a saving account , sir . What's the proper procedure ? 
 Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? 
 What is the annual interest rate ? 
 By the way , can I open a checking account too ? 

Next , please . May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ? 
 Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . 
 Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . 
 In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ? 

Morning . May I help you ? 
 Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge . 
 One percent . 
 More than enough . Please fill in this form . 
 Your passport , please . 
 I'd like to withdraw some money . 
 All right . And here's my bankbook . Is that all ? 
 Oh , yes . Here it is . 
 Four in hundred , one in ten , please . 
 By the way , I'd like to change some U . S . dollars to pounds and I want to know today's exchange rate . 
 I want 100 pounds . And here are 189 U . S . dollars . 
 Thank you . And goodbye . 

Hello , I'd like to open an account . 
 I'd like to open a savings account . What's the interest rate now ? 
 Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ? 
 What about the later deposits ? 
 OK , that's good . 
 Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 Good coming . I would like to open a new account . I want to deposit 500 dollars . 
 Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ? 
 Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 

May I help you ? 
 Do you have an account with us ? 
 Do you want large or small bills ? 
 What denomination ? 
 Do you want the whole amount in traveler's check ? 

May I help you ? 
 Of course , we'd be happy to cash it for you . 
 Well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate . 
 The service charge is 1 % of the total amount of the check . 
 Would you please countersign them here ? 
 And your passport please . 
 Sorry , sir . We can't cash the checks for you without your passport . 

Can I help you , sir ? 
 All right . How much do you need ? 
 One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ? 
 All right . Now can I have your passbook ? 
 Thank you . And what amounts do you want the checks in ? 

I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ? 
 Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? 
 What is the annual interest rate ? 
 By the way , can I open a checking account too ? 

Good morning , sir . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . Would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account ? 
 No problem , sir . What sort of time deposit account would you like to open ? 
 The minimum time period is three months . The longer the period , the higher the interest rate . If you withdraw your money before time is up , there are penalties . 
 Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ? 
 $ 200 altogether . 
 Here it is . And how much RIB shall I get ? 
 That's correct . Thank you very much . 
 Could you please fill out this form ? 
 Here's your $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , can I help you ? 
 What kind of currency have you got ? 
 One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan . 
 Minus the fee . Here are your dollars . Please sign here . 

Good afternoon , Mr.Chen . How are you ? 
 How much do you want , Mr.Chen ? 
 The rate is still high for other foreign currencies . The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi is 1.053 Renminbi yuan to one dollar . 
 Certainly , sir . How do you want it ? 
 Yes , Mr.Chen . Here you are . 

Excuse me . I'd like to cash the traveler's check . 
 In tens and fifties , please . 
 OK , thank you . 
 Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ? 
 OK . Go ahead . 
 How amazing ! I have never seen it before . Is it expensive ? 
 OK , I will take one . 
 Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing . 
 We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . 

Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ? 
 Which is the best way ? 
 $ 800 . 
 How long does it take ? 
 I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? 
 And how long do those take ? 
 I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? 

How do you use an ATM card , billy ? 
 Oh yes . I've got it written down here . Just a minute . 
 Ok , I've entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? 
 I can just enter the amount using the keys , right ? 
 These machines aren't very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 
 Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ? 
 Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please . 
 Six hundred euro . 
 Here you are . 
 In fifties please . 
 Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ? 
 Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? 
 Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ? 
 That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? 

Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 Have you filled out an application form ? 
 Yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? 
 Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . 
 It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? 
 The maximum is $ 1000 . 
 Yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . 
 They're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 What stock do you want to buy and how many ? 
 Let me get the asking price of the stock . Just a moment . Oh , now the asking price is $ 90 each share . By the way , what is the offering price ? 
 Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2 . It's hard to take place today . 
 You can decide by yourself . 
 So , now I will buy you . Are you sure ? 

Good afternoon , madam . Can I help you ? 
 OK . How do you like your money , madam ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'll check for you . 
 Would you like a savings or a chequing account ? 
 Right.Could you fill out this form please ? 
 According to today's exchange rate , every US dollar in cash is equivalent to 0.75 euros . 
 We charge a 1 euro commission on each deal . How much would you like to change ? 
 No problem . 
 No , I don't . I don't have a family , so I don't think I need it . 
 Thank you , but I've never thought about it before . 

May I help you ? 
 Sure.Please sign your name here ... and here . 
 Thanks.How would you like them ? 

Good morning , madam . 
 May I help you ? 
 This way , please . 
 You're welcome .

 Why do you buy stocks , then ?

 Pardon ? 
 I'm sorry , sir , after 7 
 I'm afraid we cannot help you , sir , because that would be violating the regulations . I owe an apology for doing nothing about it . 

Can you exchange this for US dollars , please ? 
 OK . Here . 
 Five tens , five fives and the rest in ones , please . 

I'd like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? 
 I have a driver's licence , a membership card and my passport . Will they do ? 
 What's the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? 
 Thank you . 
 How much would you like to borrow ? 
 Let me check with our credit manager . ( later ) Our record shows that your credit rating is quite high . I don't think you'll have any problems . 
 Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out this application form ? 
 Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please . 
 Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest . 
 It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account . 

Can you change American dollars into French francs ? 
 Fifty dollars . What is the exchange rate today ? 
 Yes , please . And you can cash my traveler's check , can't you ? 
 I want to be here tomorrow . What are your business hours ? 
 Thank you .

 Now , how would you like this check cashed , madam ? 
 Here you are . 
 Just make out a deposit slip and come here during bank hours . That's from 9 a . m . to 3 p . m . 
 Good morning . I'd like to cash this check . 
 What about the driving license ? 
 I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . 
 Thank you . Here you are . 
 Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 

Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan . 
 No . I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation . You may inspect my accounts . From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations . 
 Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year . 

Could I change these pounds for dollars , please ? 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Yes , I'd like to know the exchange rate for yen . 
 Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC . 
 Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan . 
 You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments . 
 Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank . 
 You're welcome .

 If you don't mind , Mr . Smith , please go to counter number six to queue up and wait for the service . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , I'm excited to hear about your new product . 
 Yes . I've heard a lot about it . 
 Yes , I would have to agree with you . It seems to offer more options than the others . But new product sometimes has a few troubles . How about yours ? 
 How do you ensure quality ? 
 Are your prices negotiable ? 
 What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases ? 
 I see . But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision . 

We are willing to participate in the bid which you advertised in China Daily . Would you please tell me the detail of the tender conditions ? 
 OK ! Our company is very interested in the tender . I am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory . 
 Maybe I have asking too many questions today . 
 Fine , thanks a lot . Bye !

Hello , how can I help you today ? 
 OK , please fill in a Deposit Slip . All you need to do is to write the amount here and your name over here , on this line . I'll take care of the rest . First , could I see some ID ? 

I'd like to remit 5000 dollars to my friend . 
 Room 20 , Suzie Building , Beijing Road , Shenzhen , China . 

I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank . 
 Here you go . Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in ? 
 OK , how long does it need to be ? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers . 

I like to open up a savings account please . 
 I want the one with the highest interest rate . 
 4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ? 
 All right . I ’ ll open one of those . 
 Thanks . 
 O . K . We offer a few different kinds . 
 That would be our Saver's Plus account . 
 You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % . 
 Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second . 

How are your stocks doing , Jim ? 
 Yeah . I lost money investing in the Internet , too . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . 
 No , what happened ? 
 Oh , boy . His wife can ’ t be happy about that . 
 Yes , dad ? 
 Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . 
 That ’ s true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? 

I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . 
 It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . 
 I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . 
 Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . 

Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . 
 Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security . It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck . 
 Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . 
 Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . 

I've got some great news for you ! 
 yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . 
 thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . 
 thank you very much . 
 I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon . 
 next week . 
 absolutely . 
 Hello , yes , I ’ d like to open a bank account . 
 What What features do they offer ? 
 I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . 
 No , that won ’ t be necessary . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars . 
 If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . 
 The insurance policy protects us . 
 It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . 
 Can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
 You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago . 
 The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed . 
 Maybe you should call your post office . 
 Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake . 
 Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day . 
 The price quoted is for CIF . 
 Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . 
 Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . 
 Which credit card are you speaking of ? 
 We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago . 
 Your bill was mailed already . 
 If you haven't gotten it yet , then you should probably take that up with your post office . 
 If that's the case , you will need to provide proof of their mistake . 
 Don't mention it . Call back if you have any more questions . 
 It ’ s easy , grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . OK . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
 You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
 Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . 
 That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .

 Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license . 
 OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back . 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t 
 I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 

I ’ Ve just taken out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . 
 I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . 
 That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . 
 Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance police . The insurance companies need to assess the risk 
 It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . 
 I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
 But what if I need my money suddenly ? 
 Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
 OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . 
 Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ? 
 That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though . 
 Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ? 
 For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ? 
 Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ? 
 May I see your passbook . 
 This is a sizable sum . Is there any reason you are closing your account with us Mr . Lee ? 
 I see . Well for this amount I will have to get my manager ’ s approval . 
 Thank you . This should only be a few minutes . If you would like , there is coffee by those sofas over there . 

Good morning , miss . 
 Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ? 
 I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please . 
 Yes , here is my account number . 
 Sure , here is my passport , by the way what is the rate today ? 
 Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ? 
 900 dollars . 
 I need 8 hundreds and the rest in 10s please ? 
 Thank you , have a nice day . 

Hey honey , how was your day ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . 
 Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . 
 I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . 

Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ? 
 Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? 
 Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? 
 I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? 
 Last night ? 
 You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? 
 What is it ? 
 What do you mean ? What happened ? 
 How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! 
 Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! 
 sure , what do you need to do there ? 
 I have to exchange some money . 
 I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . 
 their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . 
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . 
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 

Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . 
 Well . You ’ Ve come prepared.You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . 
 You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways !

 For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . 
 Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? 
 For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . 
 We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? 

What separates your product from the competition ? 
 Is the software user-friendly ? 
 Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? 

What are your terms of payment ? 
 What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? 
 We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . 

Is this the Law Firm of A & B ? 
 I need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance . 
 Is she available ? 

I ’ m so frustrated ! 
 I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! 
 yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . 
 I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . 
 Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! 
 You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . 
 Well as we know nothing comes out of a can . We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company . We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe 
 That's what we're here for , the human resources help you need , when and how you need it . 
 Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . 
 Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . 
 As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . 
 It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . 
 Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . 
 No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . 
 I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . 
 I understand , Ma'am . 
 It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . 
 Well . 
 Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . 

I ’ d like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? 
 I have the driver ’ s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ? 
 What ‘ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? 
 Thank you . 
 What ? 
 Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? 
 Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Why ? 
 Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? 
 Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? 
 That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ? 
 Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ? 
 Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars . 

Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . 
 You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? 
 Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? 
 Well , welcome to the team . 
 Yes . I've read it carefully . 
 No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? 
 But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . 
 Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? 
 I can accept that . 
 Even my health insurance ? 
 I have a few questions about the free membership . 
 Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? 
 What are bar vouchers ? 
 But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . 
 So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? 
 I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . 

I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? 
 Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . 
 So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? 
 I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion 

I ’ d like to have this cashed , please . 
 Yes . 
 Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please . 

Can you change American dollars into French francs . 
 Fifty dollars . What is the exchange rate today ? 
 Yes , please . and you can cash my travelers check . Can ’ t you ? 
 I won ’ t to be here tomorrow . What are you business hours ? 
 Thank you . 

Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . 
 Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? 
 But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . 
 One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , 

I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan . 
 A thousand dollars . 
 What ’ s the current interest rate ? 

So you've been attending night classes for a while now . Do you feel it's helping you ? 
 Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . 
 That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . 

Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? 
 What ’ s the result ? 
 That seems very impressive . Good work ! 

I ’ d like to open a current account . 
 Here your are . I wonder how much interest can I earn for my current account . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . How do I draw money from my news then . 
 Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? 
 Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? 
 Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? 

Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c 
 First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . 
 I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . 

So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? 
 Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? 
 Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . 
 I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget 

As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . 
 Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . 
 It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . 

You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . 
 As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . 
 Yes , it does . 
 Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 . 

Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . 
 How long was she employed with your company ? 
 Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? 

The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . 
 We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . 
 Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally 
 Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . 
 All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . 
 I'd like to open a new account . 
 yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? 
 that's very convenient . 
 yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? 
 is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? 
 that's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? 
 thank you very much . 

May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? 
 Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . 
 Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? 
 Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? 
 Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . 
 Thank you .
